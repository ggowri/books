        <h1>Chapter 3869</h1>
        <div> - The Real Great Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn&rsquo;t that Chu Feng was timid and cowering to pressure, it was just that the current situation was simply too dangerous. It had reached a level of danger where he had no choice but to flee.<br>The energy ripples earlier were caused by a battle between experts.<br>Although energy ripples possessed great destructive power, they were much weaker than the actual attacks that caused them.<br>Furthermore, the destruction of the energy ripples also decreased with distance they traveled. In the end, energy ripples would completely disappear...<br>Chu Feng had deduced the energy ripples came from very far away.<br>When the energy ripples reached them, their power had decreased greatly. Yet, such a weakened wave of energy ripples managed to breach an Ancient Era&rsquo;s shield capable of withstanding the attack of a rank one Utmost Exalted.<br>With that, one could very well imagine how terrifying the existences fighting ahead were.<br>Yet, that direction was already the safer direction of the cave.<br>The other direction was even more dangerous. In that direction were even more terrifying beings.<br>To attempt to explore such a place, even without being noticed by those creatures, Chu Feng and others could be killed by merely the energy ripples from their battles.<br>If they were to continue to stay in that place, it would no longer be seeking riches from dangers. Instead, they would truly be throwing away their lives for riches.<br>As such, fleeing would be the most sensible act at a time like this.<br>Soon, Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints returned to that spirit formation world.<br>Upon their return, the Mystic Cave Saints were planning to go back the way they came, and directly leave that place.<br>After all, they were already scared witless after witnessing such terrifying energy ripples.<br>The only thing in their mind was to quickly leave this dangerous place and flee far away.<br>However, at the moment when they were planning to leave, they discovered that Chu Feng was standing there motionless, seemingly pondering something.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; asked the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve fallen for a trap.&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Fallen for a trap? What do you mean?&rdquo; asked the Mystic Cave Saints in unison.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng did not answer. Instead, he suddenly sat down cross-legged and used his spirit formation to seal away the spirit formation entrance they'd opened earlier.<br>&ldquo;Assist me one more time.&rdquo; Chu Feng began setting up another spirit formation after saying those words.<br>Even though the Mystic Cave Saints were confused by what he was trying to do, they all sat down cross-legged and began to assist him in setting up his spirit formation.<br>This time around, Chu Feng took a very long time to set up his spirit formation. He spent twice the amount of time he had previously.<br>After four hours passed, Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formation was finally complete.<br>However, even after the spirit formation was activated, it still took Chu Feng quite a long time to rip a tear in the spirit formation world.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, exactly what are you trying to do?&rdquo;<br>Seeing the new opening, the Mystic Cave Saints were all confused.<br>They felt that this opening was identical to the previous opening.<br>However, Chu Feng had put much more time and effort into creating this opening.<br>They were simply unable to understand why he was doing it.<br>Compared to the confused Mystic Cave Saints, Chu Feng had a look of excitement.<br>&ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo; after saying those words, Chu Feng stepped into the new spirit formation opening.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo; The Mystic Cave Saints became even more confused upon seeing that.<br>&ldquo;Exactly what is this brat thinking?&rdquo; The others from the Mystic Cave Saints were unable to keep themselves from criticizing Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! Can&rsquo;t he just tell us what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Even the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints complained about Chu Feng.<br>That said, although they were voicing their complaints, they all stood there very obediently.<br>Led by the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints and in an orderly line, they stepped into the opening in succession.<br>After they passed through the opening, they were all shocked. Then, their expressions changed enormously.<br>Excitement appeared on their faces. Following that, ecstasy. In fact, they were unable to contain themselves, and were even shouting.<br>They were truly too excited.<br>The reason for that was because what had appeared before them when they stepped into the opening this time was a completely different scene than the one from before.<br>The place they had arrived at earlier was a strange cave.<br>However, this time around, they had entered a long corridor.<br>Like the cave from before, this corridor was also extremely large. The two sides of the corridor were deep and immeasurable.<br>Yet, different from the cave from earlier, this long corridor was meticulously engraved and finely decorated. This place was much more magnificent than even royal palaces. This was most definitely a place that was designed with the utmost care.<br>It formed a complete contrast against the desolate and ancient cave.<br>The cave they were in earlier was emitting the aura of the Ancient Era all over. As for this long corridor, no such Ancient Era&rsquo;s aura was being emitted.<br>Because of that, they came to a sudden realization.<br>It seemed like the cave they'd entered earlier was a mistake.<br>The place they were in seemed to be the actual Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, did we enter the wrong place earlier?&rdquo; With this thought in their heads, the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints turned to seek confirmation from Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, we entered the wrong place. This is the actual Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb.&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Then what was that place from earlier?&rdquo; asked the Mystic Cave Saints curiously.<br>After all, that place was simply too strange. Although that cave was not the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb, it was much more dangerous than the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb. Although they didn&rsquo;t know what the existences living in that cave were, they were simply too terrifying, so much so that the Mystic Cave Saints were frightened from the bottom of their hearts.<br>&ldquo;That place should be the place where Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms live.&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>There was a reason why Chu Feng had such a guess in mind.<br>After all, before they even arrived at that cave, Chu Feng already knew that there were Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms living in the Reincarnation Upper Realm.<br>Merely, Chu Feng did not imagine that the place where the Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms lived was so close to the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb, so close that they were simply neighbors.<br>&ldquo;Place where Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms live?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, why would we enter that place of all places?&rdquo; asked the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints. However, right after asking that, his expression changed. He then looked to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Fallen for a trap. Brother Chu Feng, that&rsquo;s what you said earlier. You said that we&rsquo;d fallen for a trap.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, you think that is something the Great Monster Slayer Emperor deliberately designed?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if the spirit formation he set up around his tomb weakened, it would still not be that simple to enter it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If one is to use conventional methods to breach his spirit formation, they will simply not be able to enter his tomb. Instead, they will enter the dwellings of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is why brother Asura set up a completely new spirit formation. Furthermore, you spent much more time and effort to set up your spirit formation that time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That must be the case. Brother Asura, it is truly all thanks to you. If it wasn&rsquo;t for you&hellip; we would&rsquo;ve failed to notice this.&rdquo;<br>The Mystic Cave Saints had managed to react to what had happened.<br>They learned that they had fallen for the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s trap.<br>&ldquo;No wonder. It&rsquo;s no wonder the structure of that cave was different from our map.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Turns out, it&rsquo;s not the map that&rsquo;s false. Instead, that cave was simply not the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That Great Monster Slayer Emperor is simply too sinister of an individual.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Fortunately we have brother Asura with us. Otherwise, we would&rsquo;ve been deceived by him.&rdquo;<br>The Mystic Cave Saints were still feeling very displeased.<br>Although they had managed to enter the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb, they still felt lingering fear and post-traumatic stress just recalling their previous experience.<br></p></div>
