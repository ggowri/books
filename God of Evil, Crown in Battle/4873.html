        <h1>Chapter 4872</h1>
        <div>: The Arrogant Niantian<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Paying respects to Lord Clan Chief.&rdquo;<br>The experts of the Holy Light Clan who had descended from the compass together with the formation had confused looks on their faces, not knowing what was going on. Nevertheless, as soon as they saw Shengguang Xuanye, they still instinctively lowered their heads and greeted him.<br>The crowd was also bewildered as to what was going on.<br>Nothing made sense to them, be it the descent of the formation or the sudden appearance of the Holy Light Clan&rsquo;s experts. More importantly, what was Daoist Niantian intending to go with this?<br>&ldquo;Niantian, what are you doing?&rdquo; Shengguang Xuanye spoke with a hostile tone.<br>To everyone&rsquo;s shock, Daoist Niantian ignored Shengguang Xuanye and turned to look at the crowd instead.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, take a good look at this formation and try to decipher what it is. For those who aren&rsquo;t as knowledgeable, allow me to explain it to you. This formation wields the power to turn a person into a cultivation resource. It&rsquo;s the formation that young friend Chu Feng mentioned earlier, the formation that the Holy Light Clan prepared to deal with Princess Xiaoxiao,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian said.<br>&ldquo;Ah? There&rsquo;s actually such a formation in the world?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Holy Light Clan is really intending to do something as underhanded as that?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s words alone carried little weight, but with the respected Daoist Niantian bringing out the formation and saying the same words here, the crowd was starting to see some credence in the claim.<br>The formation itself had a bizarre appearance, and those who were protecting it were renowned experts of the Holy Light Clan. The crowd could recognize most of them.<br>The fact that the experts of the Holy Light Clan were guarding this formation showed that it was indeed a property of the Holy Light Clan.<br>This was indubitably concrete evidence.<br>Weng!<br>Daoist Niantian formed a series of hand seals once more.<br>Numerous figures flew out from the compass once more. From their attires, it would appear that they were members of the Holy Light Clan too. What was weird about them was that they emanated the scent of another person, and this scent corresponded to the women kneeling in front of Shengguang Xuanye.<br>&ldquo;Take a good look, young misses. These are the people who sullied your bodies. I&rsquo;ve already used a formation to amplify the lingering scent you have left on them,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian said.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Those women had insisted all this while that it was Chu Feng who violated them, but they were able to sense something familiar coming from those men of the Holy Light Clan pulled out from Daoist Niantian&rsquo;s compass right away.<br>Their appearance might be different, but the auras they gave off was something they would never forget. It was an aura burned into their minds, something that triggered their deepest revulsion.<br>These auras were what they had sensed from the ones who violated them back then.<br>This was further testified from the guilt-ridden looks on the faces of those men upon meeting their eyes.<br>&ldquo;What Chu Feng said is true.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all the Holy Light Clan&rsquo;s scheme!&rdquo;<br>The truth was already out. The crowd turned to the Holy Light Clan, but no one dared to voice a single word of criticism toward them.<br>Nevertheless, when they looked at Chu Feng, there was still a hint of embarrassment on their faces. They realized that they had fallen for the Holy Light Clan&rsquo;s schemes and maligned Chu Feng.<br>They did know what kind of power the Holy Light Clan was beforehand, but such an act was still utterly revolting.<br>They were only keeping silent out of fear.<br>&ldquo;Hahahaha!&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Xuanye suddenly burst into laughter.<br>&ldquo;It looks like Chu Feng has really brought a helper with him this time around. It was just that I thought that the helper was someone from the other galaxies, but to my astonishment, it turns out to be someone from our own Holy Light Galaxy.&rdquo;<br>At this point, Shengguang Xuanye pointed a finger at Daoist Niantian.<br>&ldquo;Daoist Niantian, I have no grudge with you. Why are you colluding with Chu Feng to malign our Holy Light Clan? What benefits did Chu Feng promise you?!&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Xuanye emanated a chilling intent that swiftly swept across the lands.<br>Be it the Monstrous Herd Temple, Yu Heavenly Clan, Cloudsky Immortal Sect, or the other powers present, everyone fell silent. Regardless of what they thought, no one spoke a word at all.<br>This was Shengguang Xuanye, the strongest expert of the Holy Light Galaxy. No one dared to undermine his authority.<br>&ldquo;Hahahaha!&rdquo;<br>Yet, Daoist Niantian actually laughed in the face of the infuriated Shengguang Xuanye. There was no fear on his face, only contempt.<br>&ldquo;Lord Xuanye, I have little association with young friend Chu Feng. I&rsquo;m here not to help him. I just can&rsquo;t stand it when someone of your standing puts on a hypocritical face to malign a junior. Your despicable means sully my eyes. I only chose to interfere because I can&rsquo;t bear to watch on anymore. As for your grudge with young friend Chu Feng, I don&rsquo;t intend to intervene.&rdquo;<br>At this point, Daoist Niantian turned to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;You can continue whatever you were planning to do earlier.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thank you, elder.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng bowed to Daoist Niantian.<br>He thought that Daoist Niantian was here to speak on Shengguang Haifu and Shengguang Yunyue&rsquo;s behalf, but who could have thought that the latter was actually here to help him?<br>Just like what Daoist Niantian said, the two of them had barely any association with each other. No matter how he looked at it, there was no reason for Daoist Niantian to help him.<br>&ldquo;Trying to acquit yourself after doing all this? Do you take me for a fool? Daoist Niantian, you&rsquo;re asking for it!&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Xuanye&rsquo;s eyes turned cold as he readied himself to make a move on Daoist Niantian.<br>&ldquo;Lord Xuanye, you wish to fight me? I suggest you think twice before making a move,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian sneered.<br>He whipped out a token and showed it to Shengguang Xuanye.<br>Upon seeing the token, Shengguang Xuanye&rsquo;s complexion turned awful. There was even a hint of fear in his eyes.<br></p></div>
