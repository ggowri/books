        <h1>Chapter 4200</h1>
        <div> - Dark Black Gate<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Lord Chu Feng, this old man has failed to properly educate his granddaughter. I&rsquo;ve made a mockery for Lord Chu Feng to see.&rdquo;<br>Old man Zhao also began crying.<br>He was still angry at Zhao Menglu, and still wanted to kill her.<br>However, since Chu Feng had stopped him, he did not dare to try again. Just like that, he had no choice but to quietly accept everything.<br>Chu Feng knew that old man Zhao needed time to calm down. Thus, he did not attempt to comfort him either. Instead, he turned around to look at Xiao Yu.<br>&ldquo;Lord Chu Feng, please spare me. I truly know my mistakes. I will never it again,&rdquo; begged Xiao Yu.<br>At that moment, practically everyone was looking at him with hostility.<br>Chu Feng, surprisingly, was the one who was looking at him with the most tranquil eyes.<br>Xiao Yu knew that it might be very difficult for him to continue living.<br>Even if Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t intend to look into the matter, the others definitely wouldn't let him live.<br>There wasn&rsquo;t anything he could do about it. After all, he had offended Chu Feng of all people.<br>&ldquo;Woosh---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng raised his arm and a beam of light landed before Xiao Yu.<br>Upon closer inspection, the crowd were all shocked. It was actually a medicinal pellet.<br>Not only was the medicinal pellet circulating with light, it was also emitting an overwhelming medicinal aroma. From a glance, they were all able to tell that it was an invaluable treasure.<br>&ldquo;Consume it, and your hand will heal.&rdquo;<br>He then turned to the rest of the crowd, &ldquo;You all shouldn&rsquo;t make things difficult for him either. Give him a chance. Besides, the mistake he made wasn't a serious blunder.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Xiao Yu, you&rsquo;re truly lucky. You&rsquo;ve encountered such a kind-hearted Lord Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. You should be expressing your thanks right now.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the crowd that had been glaring at Xiao Yu like tigers looking at their prey all began to urging Xiao Yu to thank Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, Lord Chu Feng. Thank you, Lord Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>Xiao Yu began crying again. This time, his tears were not because he was terrified. Rather, he was weeping from being moved by Chu Feng&rsquo;s actions.<br>He had truly never imagined that not only did he not hold a grudge, he had even given him a medicinal pellet to help him heal his injury.<br>If it hadn&rsquo;t been for Chu Feng, he would truly have been doomed.<br>As for Chu Feng, he did not bother much with Xiao Yu. After all, he didn&rsquo;t care much about the matter to begin with.<br>What he wanted was something different.<br>He wanted to know if there was a way to enter the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect from the treasures left behind by Zhuge Yuankong.<br>With this thought in mind, Chu Feng turned to ask the crowd, &ldquo;Everyone, do you all wish to leave this place?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Leave this place?&rdquo;<br>The crowd were all stunned upon hearing those words.<br>Many people then began nodding their heads.<br>&ldquo;We do. Of course we do.&rdquo;<br>This was especially true for the people of the older generation. They were voicing their desire to leave very loudly.<br>&ldquo;If you all wish to leave, then wait for me here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will return to find you all if I manage to find a way to leave this place.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had no idea how dangerous the place he would be heading to would be. Because of that, he could not bring the crowd along. Telling them to stay and wait would be the best choice.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, Lord Chu Feng! Thank you, Lord Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>The crowd were endlessly excited. Those from the older generation were simply overjoyed.<br>If someone else had told them that they would bring them out of the sealed world, they most likely wouldn't believe them.<br>But, the situation was different. Chu Feng was an Utmost Exalted-level expert.<br>What could an Utmost Exalted-level expert not accomplish?<br>Chu Feng did not set off immediately. Instead, he asked the Golden Crane True Immortal and plain-clothed old monk for more details about the sealed world.<br>Upon learning that the strange spirit formation beasts had come from a black gate Chu Feng immediately made it his target.<br>The black gate could very possibly be the entrance to the treasury.<br>Chu Feng had no time to delay. After a simple farewell he soared into the sky.<br>However, when Chu Feng was about to leave, he turned around and waved his hand.<br>&ldquo;Buzz---&rdquo;<br>In the next instant, dazzling, sacred light descended from the sky.<br>The light covered all the areas utilized by the cultivators.<br>The light was a spirit formation.<br>Chu Feng was worried that more spirit formation beasts would invade after he left. Thus, he had decided to leave behind a protective formation before leaving.<br>When the crowd saw the light that covered the sky, their hearts started shaking violently.<br>To them, the light was so very dazzling and the aura it emitted so very sacred. It was simply charity from a god.<br>Never had they witnessed a spirit formation technique of this caliber.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, what level are your world spirit techniques at right now?&rdquo; the Golden Crane True Immortal and plain-clothed old monk asked at the same time.<br>They were truly curious about how much Chu Feng had grown.<br>Chu Feng turned around and smiled, &ldquo;Dragon Mark Saint-cloak.&rdquo;<br>After he said those words, his body shifted, and he disappeared into thin air.<br>&ldquo;Dragon Mark Saint-cloak?&rdquo;<br>Shock filled the faces of the Golden Crane True Immortal and plain-clothed old monk.<br>After all, according to their knowledge, even the strongest world spiritist in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield, Grandmaster Liangqiu, was only a Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.<br>Chu Feng actually become a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist?<br>Wouldn&rsquo;t that mean that he had surpassed Grandmaster Liangqiu to become the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s strongest world spiritist?!<br>Thinking back to how small and weak Chu Feng had been back in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, how he had still needed their protection and aid, and then seeing how powerful Chu Feng had become, they felt an indescribable sense of shock.<br>It was something that only people like them, people who had interacted with Chu Feng when he was weak, could understand.<br>After their moment of astonishment, the two old men looked to each other and suddenly started laughing.<br>&ldquo;Truly a demon-level genius.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Xuanyuan has a qualified successor to carry out his undertaking.&rdquo;<br>They'd known that Chu Feng would be able to attain greatness in the future.<br>But, never did they imagine his growth to be so fast.<br>It had only been a short few years...<br>They had thought that it might be possible for Chu Feng to be able to move about unhindered in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm now.<br>But, never did they imagine that Chu Feng would be able to move about unhindered in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>Furthermore, judging from the way things were, it was likely that very few people in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield could even match him.<br>At that moment, the two of them both sighed emotionally.<br>What was a genius?<br>This was what a genius was!<br>&hellip;...<br>Chu Feng flew rapidly according to the directions that had been given to him by the plain-clothed old monk.<br>All the obstructions he encountered on his way were unable to stop him.<br>Thus, it didn&rsquo;t take long before he had arrived at the location indicated by the plain-clothed old monk.<br>But, when Chu Feng arrived before the black gate, he started frowning.<br>The black gate was located between mountain peaks. But, it was taller than the peaks it was between.<br>It measured tens of thousands of meters in height. It surpassed the clouds and shot straight into the heavens.<br>The gate was entirely pitch-black. Not only was it extremely imposing, it was also very strange.<br>Only a small crack was visible in the gate. Yet, the oppressive sensation emitted by that crack was enough to make breathing difficult for Chu Feng.<br>Very rarely did Chu Feng encounter auras that were so dangerous. It was as if what lived inside the gate were demons from hell.<br>Truth be told, even Chu Feng was scared.<br>Chu Feng was not a cowardly person. But, the impact brought upon him by the gate was enough to make him tremble.<br>&ldquo;Senior Zhuge Yuankong, exactly what sort of terrifying thing did you leave behind?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng narrowed his brows. A look of unease appeared in his eyes. But, in the end, his body flew forward into the gate.<br>&ldquo;Allow this junior to experience what senior has left behind.&rdquo;<br></p></div>
