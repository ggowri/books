        <div> - Chu Feng Cannot Be Touched<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s warship. Chu Feng had managed to get some time alone, with the excuse that he needed to treat his injuries.<br>That said, at that very moment, the voice that was heard from outside made Chu Feng realize that it would be very difficult for him to continue to enjoy his time in peace.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng is still treating his injuries and resting. If Lord Clan Chief needs to see him, it would not be too late to discuss matters with young friend Chu Feng after his injuries are healed.&rdquo;<br>That voice was from Wuming Xingyun.<br>Wuming Xingyun had also received the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s invitation. That was the reason why he was on the warship. However, he was originally going to be on the same warship as the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the other grand characters.<br>Yet, he insisted on staying on Chu Feng's warship. The reason for that was simply because Chu Feng was there.<br>Wuming Xingyun was doing that to protect him. Thus, he stayed outside of his room while Chu Feng was treating his injuries.<br>Had it been others that had come to seek him out, Chu Feng could ignore them. However, he could not do so at that moment. The reason for that was because the person who had come to find him was the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Tantai Xiangnan.<br>Facing a grand individual like Tantai Xiangnan, if he were to act forcibly, not even Wuming Xingyun would be able to protect Chu Feng.<br>Furthermore, Chu Feng was a person of the younger generation. As such, he should not put on airs before a grand character like Tantai Xiangnan.<br>Thus, Chu Feng walked out of his room.<br>&ldquo;Junior Chu Feng pays his respects to Lord Clan Chief.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, why did you come out?&rdquo; Wuming Xingyun was surprised to see him.<br>&ldquo;Senior, my injuries have been healed,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great. Clan Chief Tantai just so happened to want to chat with you,&rdquo; As Wuming Xingyun spoke, he planned to enter Chu Feng&rsquo;s room.<br>However, right at that moment, the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief smiled at Wuming Xingyun, &ldquo;Milord, would it be possible for you to allow young friend Chu Feng and I some personal time to chat?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Wuming Xingyun revealed a look of caution.<br>&ldquo;I wish to talk to young friend Chu Feng about some things that concern our clan,&rdquo; said the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Senior, please,&rdquo; Chu Feng raised his hand to show the way for the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. As he spoke, he cast a meaningful glance at Wuming Xingyun.<br>Chu Feng was informing Wuming Xingyun that things were alright, and that he could deal with it.<br>Seeing that, Wuming Xingyun no longer said anything, and allowed the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and Chu Feng to be in the room together. That said, he continued to stand guard outside the door.<br>As for what the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief wanted to discuss with Chu Feng, it was naturally the matter regarding the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound.<br>Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie had entered the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound&rsquo;s hidden path of certain death. Yet, not only did the two of them manage to exit it alive, but they were also accompanied by an abnormal sign.<br>As such, how could the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief not question them about what they&rsquo;d experienced.<br>After all, the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound was rumored to be an entrance leading to the depths of the Nine Dragons Upper Realm.<br>That said, Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie had both anticipated the coming of such a day. Thus, they had discussed what they were going to say before they exited the hidden path of certain death.<br>The two of them had decided to lie, and not say what had truly happened in the depths of the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound.<br>They merely mentioned that there were frightening creatures inside the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound. However, they were uncertain as to what those creatures were. They merely knew that they were very powerful. When they were escaping from those creatures, they inadvertently entered a tunnel. To their surprise, the tunnel possessed a very powerful attractive force, and sucked the two of them into a completely different space. Then, through the tunnel, they returned to the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound.<br>After hearing what Chu Feng said, the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief did not say much.<br>The reason for that was because he had already sought out Wuma Shengjie before going to see Chu Feng. What Chu Feng had told him was exactly the same as what Wuma Shengjie had told him.<br>Furthermore, both Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie were very calm and composed when they spoke of the matter. Their behavior was very natural, and simply did not resemble that of people who were lying.<br>Even if the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief suspected that they were lying, there was nothing he could do about it.<br>Thus, the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked Chu Feng something else. &ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, how is your father doing?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Father is imprisoned in our clan&rsquo;s forbidden area. I am unable to meet him either,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that your Chu Heavenly Clan was able to enter the forbidden area at will,&rdquo; the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;That is indeed the case. However, I am unqualified to use that teleportation formation,&rdquo; After saying those words, Chu Feng asked, &ldquo;Senior, why are you suddenly asking me about this? Could it be that you&rsquo;re acquainted with my father?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Xuanyuan is someone known by everyone in the Ancestral Martial Starfield. I was fortunate to possess a slight friendship with your father.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, I am rather concerned about his situation. I&rsquo;ve heard that the place that your father is imprisoned in is currently being sealed off by a very powerful barrier. Because of that barrier, no one is able to enter that place.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of that, I was worried about whether some sort of unforeseen event might&rsquo;ve occurred,&rdquo; the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Ah? There&rsquo;s such a thing?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, where did you hear about that? Is the information reliable?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng reacted with great astonishment. It was as if it was the first time he had learned of the matter.<br>&ldquo;The news is definitely reliable. Young friend Chu Feng, I think that some sort of unforeseen event must&rsquo;ve happened. After you return to your clan, you should go and ask your clansmen. Perhaps you will get an answer from them,&rdquo; the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;I hope that my Lord Father has not met with any mishaps,&rdquo; Chu Feng was shaking. His performance of panic and worry was done brilliantly. It simply did not appear to be a pretense at all.<br>&ldquo;Senior, I am truly thankful for your magnificent hospitality in inviting me. However, this Chu Feng cannot disregard my father&rsquo;s safety. Thus, I am afraid that I cannot stay for long,&rdquo; he added.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, I am able to understand your frame of mind. Actually, I&rsquo;ve already heard about your business from Xing&rsquo;er. You must be concerned about your friend&rsquo;s disappearance, right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, I will personally investigate this matter. I will definitely give you a satisfactory answer,&rdquo; the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said as he patted Chu Feng&rsquo;s shoulder.<br>Then, he had a brief chat with Chu Feng before leaving.<br>After he left, the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief returned to another warship of the Tantai Heavenly Clan.<br>There was a palace present on the warship. Inside the palace were gathered all of the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s upper echelons.<br>They were all waiting for their Clan Chief&rsquo;s return.<br>After the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief returned, he informed everyone about everything that he had learned from Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie.<br>Those were the things that the people present wanted to know about too.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, that Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie must be lying.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We all know how dangerous the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound is. For them to be able to return alive, they must&rsquo;ve experienced some sort of extraordinary experience. However, they deemphasized their experience in such a manner. It is obvious that they are lying to us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, since they are refusing a toast, our Tantai Heavenly Clan must teach them a lesson,&rdquo; said an elder.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng absolutely cannot be touched,&rdquo; said the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br></p></div>
