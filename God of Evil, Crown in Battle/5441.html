        <h1>Chapter 5441: A Chance to Live</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>The mountain harnessed the power of a rank five Half-God level cultivator. The woman was a Gold Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist!</span><br><span>Killing intent flashed across Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes. He wouldn&rsquo;t show mercy to anyone who tried to take his life.</span><br><span>He quickly constructed a movement formation to dodge the attack, but the woman changed the trajectory of the mountain formation with a simple flick of her finger. The fact that she was able to adeptly control such a huge formation showed that she was a prodigy.</span><br><span>Seeing that it was impossible to escape, Chu Feng pointed his finger at the sky.</span><br><span>Shoosh!</span><br><span>A massive sword manifested out of nowhere and pierced through the mountain. With a loud explosion, the mountain shattered into bits.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That fellow!&rdquo; The woman was astonished.</span><br><span>Even though Chu Feng was only a Purple Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, the prowess of his formation sword was actually stronger than her formation. Furthermore, the formation sword pushed further on even after destroying the mountain to attack her.</span><br><span>Believing that the formation sword had lost most of its momentum after being impeded by her mountain formation, she paid no heed to it and instead prepared another means to attack Chu Feng.</span><br><span>To her astonishment, the formation sword suddenly divided into countless golden swords amidst a flash of golden light and rained down on her. It was only then that the woman realized that she had underestimated Chu Feng and his formation.</span><br><span>It turned out that Chu Feng had hidden this trap with a concealment formation. He had intentionally made her drop her guard before launching a fatal attack.</span><br><span>However, the woman didn&rsquo;t lose her nerves just because of that. Instead, she formed a series of hand seals and manifested a protective formation. She was confident that her protective formation would protect her from Chu Feng&rsquo;s rain of golden swords.</span><br><span>&ldquo;This is bad!&rdquo;</span><br><span>The woman&rsquo;s eyes narrowed as she realized that she had fallen into yet another trap.</span><br><span>She was right to think that the initial rain of swords couldn&rsquo;t breach her protective formation, but the subsequent swords grew increasingly stronger. It didn&rsquo;t take long for her protective formation to be destroyed.</span><br><span>But before the rain of swords could tear her into shreds, she suddenly vanished into thin air before reappearing in the sky. She had relocated through the use of a teleportation talisman.</span><br><span>She had secretly prepared this teleportation talisman in case she needed to make a getaway should the situation go awry. This teleportation talisman could be instantaneously invoked, but it was unable to bring her too far away.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Not only do you possess heaven-defying battle power as a world spiritist, but you&rsquo;re also capable of instantaneously constructing a formation within another. Whose disciple are you?&rdquo; The woman looked at Chu Feng with a hint of wonderment.</span><br><span>She could tell just how complicated Chu Feng&rsquo;s earlier attack was. The formation sword contained not just a concealment formation but also two compounded slaughter formations, each stronger than the other. Otherwise, there was no way the sword rain could have torn through her protective formation.</span><br><span>She could have constructed such a formation with ample time too, but doing so in the heat of a moment was beyond her. In fact, she would go so far as to claim that there was hardly anyone in the world who was capable of such a preciselevel of control.</span><br><span>Yet, Chu Feng actually achieved it. This showed that he was a prodigy amongst prodigies.</span><br><span>But even prodigies needed the guidance of a veteran in order to reach great heights, which was why she was curious to know whose disciple Chu Feng was.</span><br><span>Chu Feng ignored her and instead formed a series of hand seals. In the blink of an eye, he teleported behind the woman with a formation sword in hand. His movements were so </span><span>fast that the woman couldn&rsquo;t react at all.</span><br><span>Before the woman could react, the sheer momentum of the formation sword had already pierced through her chest and pinned her to the ground.</span><br><span>&ldquo;When did you&hellip;&rdquo;</span><br><span>The woman stared at Chu Feng in fear. She had already figured out that Chu Feng had prepared a teleportation talisman beforehand, or else there was no way he could have moved that quickly. However, she couldn&rsquo;t understand how Chu Feng was able to plant a teleportation formation at the exact location where she had placed hers.</span><br><span>Such a thing couldn&rsquo;t be a coincidence, so Chu Feng must have somehow seen through her. That would mean that Chu Feng had noticed her teleportation talisman even though she had carefully hidden it. Just how sharp must his eyes be to notice her hidden teleportation talisman in the midst of a battle?</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re only alive right now because I want to know your relationship with the Pill Dao Immortal Sect,&rdquo; Chu Feng said coldly.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I am but a mercenary,&rdquo; the woman replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I see. Got it.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Hostility seeped into Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes once more as he swung his sword to claim the woman&rsquo;s life, but his eyes widened the next moment.</span><br><span>The woman suddenly dissipated into a whiff of smoke, and the smoke drifted a distance away before converging back into her. At the same time, the wound in her chest began to heal.</span><br><span>It was a formation, but it was not from the woman but from someone else.</span><br><span>&ldquo;A protective formation? How many more times can it save you?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t bothered by the fact that the woman was saved by a protective formation, knowing that such formations only worked once. It was unlikely that the woman would have any more aces up her sleeves.</span><br><span>The woman flicked her wrist and whipped out an awfully simplified sword that looked more like a lump of iron instead. Yet, she revealed a confident look despite her shabby weapon.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re formidable. I wouldn&rsquo;t have been a match for you under normal circumstances, but you don&rsquo;t stand a chance against me with this sword in my grasp. Tell me who your master is, and I might consider sparing your life!&rdquo;</span></p></div>
