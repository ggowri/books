        <h1>Chapter 4324</h1>
        <div>: Elder Lingtao<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Long Mumu? May I know how outstanding this Princess Mumu is? Does her capability really exceed that of Princess Xiaoxiao?&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist asked skeptically.<br>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;<br>The Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief shut down the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s doubts right away. He began to explain the strengths that Long Mumu had to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>From the Clan Chief&rsquo;s tone, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist could tell that he was extremely fond of Long Mumu, and doted on her a lot.<br>He was making it very clear that he was determined to give this opportunity to Long Mumu, and that Long Xiaoxiao didn&rsquo;t stand a chance at all.<br>In fact, in order to ensure that it was Long Mumu who got chosen, the Clan Chief even made a lot of comparisons between the Long Mumu and Long Xiaoxiao, and the results of the comparisons always highlighted Long Mumu&rsquo;s superiority.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good as long as you have a person in mind, Clan Chief. Inform that princess to make some preparations,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, should I call my daughter to come here right away?&rdquo; the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>Even though he was the esteemed leader of the Dragon Clan, it was clear that he held the Ox-nosed Old Daoist in high regard. Otherwise, he wouldn&rsquo;t have wasted his breath to say so much in order to convince the latter that Long Mumu was the more suitable candidate of the two.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to call her over right away. I&rsquo;ll need some time to open a slit. Tell her to prepare herself and don&rsquo;t run around the place. You can call her over with Chu Feng later on,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.<br>&ldquo;Alright. I&rsquo;ll listen to Grandmaster&rsquo;s arrangements.&rdquo;<br>The Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief immediately dispatched some men to inform Long Mumu of this matter.<br>Meanwhile, Chu Feng and Long Nanxun finally arrived at Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s living place.<br>Chu Feng had to admit that the place where Long Xiaoxiao was confined was actually not too bad. While it was located inside the Long Clan, her &lsquo;living place&rsquo; encompassed a huge area.<br>There were mountains and rivers all around, such that it was worthy of being described with the word &lsquo;boundless&rsquo;.<br>And all of this belonged to Long Xiaoxiao.<br>One must know that this was not a newly-established world, but real land!<br>There were so many people in the Dragon Clan, yet Long Xiaoxiao dominated so much land by herself. From this, it could be seen that Long Xiaoxiao was indeed doted on previously.<br>But that was all the past now.<br>Even though this piece of land still belonged to Long Xiaoxiao, it had been sealed off. Long Xiaoxiao could still move freely around this land, but that was as far as she could go.<br>Chu Feng could sense several powerful presences hiding around as soon as he came into its vicinity. It was as if they were warning him not to approach.<br>Due to these people guarding the area, there was no way Long Xiaoxiao could possibly get out of here.<br>Judging from their auras, Chu Feng deduced that even if they weren&rsquo;t at Martial Exalted, they were most probably veryclose to that.<br>Otherwise, they wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to exert such great pressure on Chu Feng either.<br>&ldquo;Hold it right there.&rdquo;<br>Just as Chu Feng and Long Nanxun were about to step across the boundary of the land, a deep, resonating voice suddenly boomed from the distance. Following that, a silhouette surfaced by the horizon, and it flitted swiftly toward the two of them.<br>It was an old man.<br>Perhaps it was to warn Chu Feng and Long Nanxun, but the old man had released the full might of his aura as soon as he appeared.<br>His cultivation was formidable too. He was a rank eightUtmost Exalted.<br>However, there was one thing that was worth noting.<br>Typically speaking, as the old man was from the Dragon Clan, it should stand to reason that he would direct his hostility toward the outsider, Chu Feng. However, that was not what the old man did. From the moment he appeared, his gaze had been fixated on Long Nanxun, and his eyes were filled with antagonism.<br>It almost felt as if the old man was looking at his nemesis instead of a fellow clan member.<br>At the same time, Chu Feng also noticed that Long Nanxun&rsquo;s eyes, when looking at the old man, were filled with hatred too.<br>From these two simple gazes, he was able to infer that even though those two were from the same clan, it was likely that they were on opposite sides.<br>As soon as the old man landed on the ground, he began berating Long Nanxun with a harsh tone. &ldquo;Long Nanxun, I have warned you many times that you are forbidden from entering this area. Do you really need me to discipline you before you can get it into your head?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Elder Lingtao, I have heard that Lord Clan Chief doesn&rsquo;t allow Princess Xiaoxiao to leave this area, but I don&rsquo;t recall hearing that others in the clan are forbidden from approaching her too. Don&rsquo;t you think that you&rsquo;re overstepping your boundaries over here?&rdquo; Long Nanxun replied fearlessly to the aggressive Elder Lingtao.<br>&ldquo;Oh ho! Long Nanxun, it seems like you&rsquo;ve gained some guts! To think that you would dare to speak to me in such a manner!&rdquo; Elder Lingtao&rsquo;s eyes turned cold.<br>From those words, Chu Feng realized that Long Nanxun had usually been in a disadvantageous position against Elder Lingtao so far. It was only today that he was standing up more than usual.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s under the orders of Lord Clan Chief that we are guarding this area. By doubting our intentions, you are doubting the authority of Lord Clan Chief too. Long Nanxun, are you really tired of living?&rdquo;<br>Elder Lingtao eyed Long Nanxun with narrowed eyes that carried a hint of viciousness.<br>Boom!<br>A deep explosion suddenly sounded as Elder Lingtao released a powerful oppressive might from his body.<br>A powerful force struck Chu Feng and Long Nanxun like crashing tidal waves.<br>That being said, Elder Lingtao didn&rsquo;t really intend to harm the two of them. Otherwise, given his strength, he could have easily obliterated Long Nanxun and Chu Feng with just his oppressive might itself.<br>He was well-aware that no matter how much he detested Long Nanxun, there was a limit to what he could do. What he was doing right now was just to punish Long Nanxun, as well as to scare him into submission.<br>As such, this oppressive might didn&rsquo;t hurt Chu Feng or Long Nanxun at all. In fact, it didn&rsquo;t even bind their bodies.<br></p></div>
