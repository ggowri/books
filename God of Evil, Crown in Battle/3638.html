        <div> - Challenge The Third World<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Faced with the crowd&rsquo;s shock-filled gazes, Chu Feng did not reveal excessive conceit. He merely had a faint smile on his face.<br>&ldquo;Why are you all still standing there? It&rsquo;s time to turn the situation around,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Right! It&rsquo;s time for us to put on a show!&rdquo;<br>Hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words, the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations all turned their gazes to the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, they all rushed to attack with their weapons and treasures from afar.<br>The All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations were not to be outdone. One by one, they unleashed their own attacks to face the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations head-on.<br>At that moment, chess power was wreaking havoc throughout the first world. Even though the number of people present was not great, the sight was rather spectacular.<br>However, the people from the Ancestral Martial Starfield gained the upper hand in the battle from the very start.<br>The majority of the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations in the first world were actually more or less equally as powerful as the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>Now that the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations were all clad in treasures, the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations were simply unable to contend against them.<br>That said, there was an exception to that -- Chen Hui.<br>Chen Hui was, after all, someone who was capable of entering the third world.<br>His chess power was not something that the people of the younger generation in the first world could compare to.<br>Thus, even though the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations were all clad in treasures, he was not at all disadvantaged fighting them. In fact, he was exerting dominance over them.<br>Unfortunately, as the saying went, two fists cannot take on four hands. This situation held even more true for Chen Hui, as he was facing so many people of the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations, who all had treasures.<br>With the situation being like that, even Chen Hui was powerless to turn the situation around.<br>Without any suspense, the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations defeated the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>Seeing the battlefield, the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations felt extremely pleased.<br>This was the first time that they had felt so pleased in the many times that they fought against the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>After all, it could be said that they&rsquo;d crushed their opponents completely.<br>That said, they&rsquo;d never imagined that the reason why they would win was because of Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>When the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations turned around, they suddenly discovered that Chu Feng, who had been standing behind them, had disappeared.<br>&ldquo;He has most likely entered the second world,&rdquo; said the head flag-bearer from Monstrous Holy City.<br>&ldquo;Head flag-bearer, do you know how Chu Feng was able to grasp such an ability? He actually managed to unearth all those treasures and control them.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, expressions of alarm filled the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations. They were still immersed in the shocked state from witnessing the magnificent feat performed by Chu Feng. At the same time, they were completely confused as to how he had done it.<br>&ldquo;Something like this is simply unheard of. Thus, I also do not know how he accomplished it,&rdquo; the head flag-bearer from Monstrous Holy City shook his head.<br>In fact, he was not the only one that was unable to understand how Chu Feng had accomplished such a feat. Even the spectators outside that were able to clearly witness what was happening inside the chess formation were unable to understand.<br>&ldquo;Lord Shoujian, exactly what sort of ability did Chu Feng use?&rdquo;<br>The confused people of the younger generation outside the chess formation all turned their gazes to Lord Shoujian.<br>Whilst the people of the first world were unable to see the situation in the second world, the people outside were able to clearly see it.<br>Sure enough, Chu Feng had entered the second world.<br>Originally, the situation in the second world was identical to that of the first world. Due to the fact that the All-heaven Starfield had left two experts capable of entering the third world in the second world, the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations in the second world were simply unable to contend against the All-heaven Starfield, and entered a state of absolute inferiority from the very start.<br>However, when Chu Feng entered the second world, the situation of the battle was instantly reversed.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng did the same thing he had done in the first world in the second world.<br>Chu Feng first unleashed a boundless amount of chess power from within him. Then, the earth of the second world started to cave in. It was like the arrival of doomsday.<br>After that, the treasures hidden deep within the second world all emerged from beneath the ground and flew towards the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>The treasures from the second world were much more powerful than those from the first world.<br>Thus, with the help of those treasures, the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations gained absolute superiority over the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>All of this was due to Chu Feng.<br>All by himself, Chu Feng managed to turn the battle around.<br>&ldquo;Lord Shoujian, exactly what is happening?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How did that guy find all those treasures?&rdquo;<br>Curious, the people of the younger generation questioned Lord Shoujian again.<br>They truly wanted to know exactly how he had accomplished such a thing.<br>&ldquo;It is truly not that this old man does not want to answer your questions. It&rsquo;s simply that even this old man does not know how he accomplished that.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unless&hellip;&rdquo; said Lord Shoujian.<br>&ldquo;Unless?&rdquo; asked the crowd in unison.<br>&ldquo;It's not the first time for young friend Chu Feng to encounter Ancient Era&rsquo;s Cultivator Chess.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It's possible that his understanding of Ancient Era&rsquo;s Cultivator Chess far surpasses our own,&rdquo; said Lord Shoujian.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. It must not be the first time that he has entered the chess formation. Otherwise, how could he move about the chess formation at will? His understanding of the chess formation simply surpasses our own.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Motherfucker!<br>Turns out, that guy was actually a wolf in sheep's clothing!<br>&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Shameless, he&rsquo;s truly too shameless!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How could that guy be so despicable?!&rdquo;<br>The All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations were thoroughly enraged. It was only at that moment that they realized that they had completely underestimated Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng was actually an expert at pretending to be a pig so that he could consume tigers.<br>&ldquo;Look! Chu Feng is going to enter the third world!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, someone cried out in alarm.<br>At that moment, the people outside the chess formation all noticed that Chu Feng was emitting sacred white light from his body. He was planning to enter the third world.<br>At that moment, the hearts of the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations tensed up.<br>As for the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations, looks of anticipation filled their eyes.<br>This was especially true for Lord Shoujian. His aged eyes were emitting a very bright look. He was looking forward to Chu Feng&rsquo;s performance in the third world even more than those people of the younger generation.<br>After all, the third world was completely different from the first and second world.<br>In the third world was the person deemed to be the genius with the strongest chess power in history, Nangong Yifan.<br>Even though Chu Feng&rsquo;s performance had dumbfounded them, Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s performance was not at all inferior to his.<br>Because of their strategy in dispatching their forces to the first and second worlds, the All-heaven Starfield only had eight people in the third world. The Ancestral Martial Starfield, on the other hand, had twelve people.<br>In terms of numbers, the Ancestral Martial Starfield held absolute superiority.<br>However, even with that, Nangong Yifan still did not do anything.<br>He was only standing there and commanding the other seven.<br>Thus, the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations were taking on the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s twelve people with only seven.<br>Yet, even with that being the case, they were still at an advantage on the battlefield. Furthermore, their superiority was expanding nonstop.<br>Everyone knew that it was all due to Nangong Yifan.<br>Even without him joining the battle, he had already sealed their victory.<br>If he were to join the battle, who could possibly contend against him?<br>Would Chu Feng really be able to contend against him?<br></p></div>
