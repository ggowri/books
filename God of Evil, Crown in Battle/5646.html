        <h1>Chapter 5646: Fresh Comparison</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xiao </span><span>Yueyue&rsquo;s</span><span> master, the Beast Realm Heavenly Exalted, was a highly acclaimed world spiritist. He was born as a monstrous beast, and he was known to be the strongest monstrous beast world spiritist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xiao </span><span>Yueyue</span><span> was born as a monstrous beast too. She had excellent talent as a world spiritist, but she was actually much more talented as a cultivator. On top of being a Blue Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, she was also a rank three Half-God level cultivator. On top of that, she could further raise her cultivation by a rank through her monstrous beast bloodline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was with her overwhelming strength that she cleared the forest and entered this realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She deduced that the area beneath the lightning clouds was the only way out of this place, so she made her way over. She encountered the fruit monsters, but she was able to deal with them easily and obtain the fruits. Even so, she decided to advance carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beneath her brutish appearance was a meticulous heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did she expect the earth to suddenly rumble, and hundreds of golden fruit monsters crawled out from the ground. These monsters were scattered around the place, but they just so happened to encircle her. Furthermore, their senses were keen, such that they could see through her concealment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Left with no choice, she could only confront them in a fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These golden fruit monsters were at rank three Half-God level, but they were surprisingly able to construct formations in a group despite their lack of sentience. This raised their fighting prowess to rank four Half-God level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when Xiao </span><span>Yueyue</span><span> raised her cultivation to rank four Half-God level, she could only barely stand against them. She found herself unable to break free of their encirclement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this rate, she might just lose her life here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, ten rays of light flashed across the sky. They were formation swords.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These formation swords surged through the monsters like shooting stars, leaving a blood trail wherever they passed by. All it took was the blink of an eye for the hundreds of golden fruit monsters to be decimated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These swords came from a formation constructed by a Golden Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taken aback, Xiao </span><span>Yueyue</span><span> turned her gaze over to the source of the formation, only to see a group of people looking at her. However, it didn&rsquo;t take her long to lock her eyes on the center figure of the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Chu Feng who had saved her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt relieved, but there was a tinge of embarrassment too. If she had a choice, the person whom she least wanted to be her savior was Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Why did you save me?&rdquo; Xiao </span><span>Yueyue</span><span> asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast to the awkward Xiao </span><span>Yueyue</span><span>, Chu Feng revealed a smile and said, &ldquo;What nonsense are you spouting? Aren&rsquo;t we teammates?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;We no longer are,&rdquo; Xiao </span><span>Yueyue</span><span> replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you decided on your own,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of his sleeve, he collected all of the fruits from the dead golden fruit monsters, but instead of taking it for himself, he delivered them to Xiao </span><span>Yueyue</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What do you mean by this?&rdquo; Xiao </span><span>Yueyue</span><span> was confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;These are for you,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re giving all of these to me?&rdquo; Xiao </span><span>Yueyue</span><span> was baffled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;We have already gotten our share,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied. &ldquo;There might be rank six Half-God level or even stronger monsters up ahead, so I&rsquo;m escorting them back first before exploring the area. Do you want to come with us?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xiao </span><span>Yueyue</span><span> stared at the hundreds of golden fruits floating before her contemplatively before bursting into laughter. &ldquo;Of course. I won&rsquo;t be able to deal with rank six Half-God level monsters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng smiled at that sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He brought Xiao </span><span>Yueyue</span><span> and the others to a safe zone before exploring the center of the desert alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he left, Xiao </span><span>Yueyue</span><span> didn&rsquo;t settle down with Chu Shanshan and the others but instead found an isolated area for herself. However, Chu Shanshan took up to her with an apologetic expression and said, &ldquo;Miss Xiao, I&rsquo;m truly sorry. I didn&rsquo;t mean to&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Scram!&rdquo; Xiao </span><span>Yueyue</span><span> bellowed before Chu Shanshan could finish her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who had accompanied Chu Shanshan thus far quickly stood behind her, looking as if they were ready to stand up for her. The man who had attempted to grab the </span><span>Purpledemon</span><span> Dagger even confronted Xiao </span><span>Yueyue</span><span>, saying, &ldquo;Miss Xiao, don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;re going too far? There&rsquo;s no grudge between Miss Chu and you, so surely there&rsquo;s no need for you to be so hostile to her?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the argument he had with Chu Shanshan earlier, he still chose to stand up for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What do you mean by this? Are you ganging up on me? I should remind you that your guardian, Chu Feng, isn&rsquo;t here now. Unless you want to die, you better stay away from me!&rdquo; Xiao </span><span>Yueyue</span><span> spewed out as she released her oppressive might as a rank three Half-God level cultivator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn&rsquo;t hurt anyone with her oppressive might, but her tremendous strength made the crowd frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strongest one in the group was only at Gray Dragon God-cloak, which meant that they didn&rsquo;t have the strength to go against her. Thus, they had no choice but to back down and drag Chu Shanshan elsewhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xiao </span><span>Yueyue</span><span> constructed a concealment formation with a wave of her sleeves to isolate herself, not wanting to interact with Chu Shanshan and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weng!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a surge of spirit power, and thirteen people appeared in the field. They were all severely injured, and their breathing was ragged. Due to their poor condition and the fact that their backs were against the crowd, none of them actually noticed Chu Shanshan and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were excited to have managed to come this far, especially when they rose into the sky and assessed the surroundings. One of them, a blue-cloaked man, even let out </span><span>a resounding roar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Yes! We finally escaped from that darned forest! In the end, it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether that dogshit Chu Feng is favored by the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master or not! Isn&rsquo;t he still behind us in the end?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Shanshan and the others were just silently observing them, but one of them couldn&rsquo;t help but burst into laughter upon hearing those words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thirteen people in the sky quickly looked down. Some of them even whipped out their treasures and released their spirit power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of the thirteen people, the weakest of them was a Blue Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, whereas the strongest was a Purple Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist. They were stronger than Chu Shanshan and the others, but their complexions turned awful upon seeing them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who had tagged along with Chu Feng were safe and sound, and they had multiple fruits on hand. Some of them were even taking large mouthfuls from it. Their leisurely attitude sharply contrasted against the hardships they had been through.</span></p></div>
