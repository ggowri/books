        <div> - No End Of Trouble<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Lord Hall Master, we cannot allow that Chu Feng to live.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With his talent, even our Purple Star Hall would&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Pang Youyang was feeling afraid, and didn&rsquo;t finish his words.<br>However, the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master was able to understand what he wanted to say. He said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying to say that with his talent, even our Purple Star Hall would find it difficult to contain him. Sooner or later, he will surpass me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Hall Master, please punish this subordinate for my impudence.&rdquo; Pang Youyang immediately kneeled on the ground.<br>&ldquo;You can rise. What you&rsquo;ve said is correct.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is the first time this old man has witnessed talent of that caliber.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Apart from those geniuses from the Upper Starfield&rsquo;s colossuses, I&rsquo;m afraid there is no one among the younger generation capable of standing shoulder to shoulder with him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If he is allowed to grow, not to mention our Purple Star Hall, even those powers from the Middle Starfield will be trampled under his feet.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If a genius like him is able to grow smoothly, he will definitely be able to enter the arena of the Upper Starfields.&rdquo;<br>The Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master spoke those words emotionally.<br>&ldquo;Lord Hall Master, the other powers did not have any conflict with them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, it is different for our Purple Star Hall. With how much that child holds a grudge, he will remember how our Purple Star Hall had made things difficult for his Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I think that he will most likely view our Purple Star Hall as enemies,&rdquo; said Pang Youyang.<br>&ldquo;What you said is correct. That child&hellip; cannot be allowed to live.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, even if we are to kill him, we must wait till he exits the Purple Star Variance Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, he must be assassinated in secret. Else, it will cause others to speak ill of us,&rdquo; said the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>&ldquo;Milord, please leave that child to this old man,&rdquo; said Pang Youyang.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better that I do it myself. I do not wish for any mistakes to occur. Else, with the temperament that child possesses, he will cause no end of trouble,&rdquo; said the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>Hearing those words, Pang Youyang, instead of displaying any sort of displeasure, revealed a look of joy.<br>What he was afraid of was their Lord Hall Master belittling Chu Feng.<br>He felt relieved to see that his Lord Hall Master was placing so much importance on him.<br>The way he saw it, a genius of Chu Feng&rsquo;s caliber must be rooted out.<br>Even if he did not intend to become their Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s enemy, he must still be rooted out.<br>Else, once the Chu Heavenly Clan grew under his leadership, they would trample their Purple Star Hall under their feet.<br>As the power that had suppressed the Abandoned Starfields for so long, he could not allow such a thing to happen.<br>The ugliness of human nature was like that.<br>If they were total strangers, ugly and malicious people would still feel that it was completely natural for others to live better lives than them.<br>However, should they be people that they knew, and people who were worse off than them, they would become extremely displeased the moment those people surpassed them, and make a supreme effort to obstruct that sort of thing from happening.<br>That would be the case even if there were no grievances or hatreds between them.<br>&ldquo;However, perhaps there&rsquo;s no need for me to act,&rdquo; the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master said all of a sudden.<br>&ldquo;Lord Hall Master, could it be that you think the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master will be able to defeat Chu Feng?&rdquo; asked Pang Youyang.<br>&ldquo;While it is true that Chu Feng is holding absolute superiority in the confrontation of oppressive mights, oppressive might is merely the foundation of a martial cultivator. The truly powerful aspect of martial cultivators is the utilization of their abilities and skills.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Once the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master goes all-out, Chu Feng will likely find it difficult to handle,&rdquo; said the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; Pang Youyang nodded in agreement.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s begun.&rdquo; Suddenly, the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master and Pang Youyang both turned toward the sky.<br>They looked to the vast abnormal sign in the sky illuminating the scene in the Purple Star Variance Realm.<br>The Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master had started his counterattack.<br>He was no longer using only his oppressive might to confront Chu Feng.<br>In other words, he was unable to take on Chu Feng with only his oppressive might, and began to use his Immortal Techniques.<br>The Incomplete Exalted Armament in his hand was like a commanding arrow.<br>The boundless martial power in the air turned into a magnificent army of thousands of men and horses following the instructions from the commanding arrow.<br>The Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master unleashed a rank nine Immortal Technique from the get-go.<br>That was no ordinary rank nine Immortal Technique.<br>It was an Immortal Technique truly capable of dispatching a magnificent army of thousands of horses and men.<br>The Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master had used this Immortal Technique to wipe out an entire demonic sect in the past.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>That magnificent army moved to attack Chu Feng.<br>In a uniform order, they moved in midair with rumbling explosions.<br>Controlled by the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master, the magnificent army did not rashly attack Chu Feng. Instead, they surrounded him in multiple waves.<br>While they&rsquo;d yet to actually attack Chu Feng, the spirit power he'd unleashed had been suppressed by that magnificent army.<br>Because of that, many people started feeling dread for Chu Feng.<br>They felt that he might not be able to contend against the serious Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>The attack began.<br>The magnificent army&rsquo;s archers shot arrows at the same time.<br>Like a torrential rain, the arrows flew toward Chu Feng from all directions.<br>Facing the rain of arrows, Chu Feng stood there without moving.<br>The crowd thought that Chu Feng had given up on resisting. He watched as the arrows approached him without blinking once.<br>Before the crowd could think about the reason for his behavior, the arrows arrived.<br>Not only were the arrows numerous, but their attacks were also extremely strong. If they were to land on Chu Feng, he would definitely be pierced to death.<br>Seeing this scene, some of the people from the older generation that valued talents turned their heads away, unwilling to watch the death of such a rare genius.<br>&ldquo;Pa, pa, pa~~~&rdquo;<br>However, when the arrows came a meter away from Chu Feng, they all bounced away.<br>Not a single arrow managed to reach Chu Feng. Instead, after bouncing away, the arrows all shattered.<br>When the arrows all repulsed and broken, runes and symbols visible to the naked eye emerged prominently in Chu Feng&rsquo;s vicinity.<br>The revolving runes and symbols were like guards protecting Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;A protective formation?&rdquo;<br>The crowd realized what had happened.<br>It was no wonder Chu Feng was so confident. It turned out that he had long placed a powerful protective formation around himself.<br>The protective formation was so strong that not even the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master&rsquo;s rank nine Immortal Technique was able to damage it.<br>&ldquo;Humph, I&rsquo;ve long anticipated that.&rdquo; Seeing the protective formation, the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master did not panic.<br>He once again waved the Incomplete Exalted Armament he held in his hand. With that, the archers from earlier began to transform.<br>Their bodies started disintegrating into light. The bodies of lights that were the archers assimilated into the weapons held by the warriors.<br>With that, the weapons that were held by those warriors began to shine with a strange light.<br>Merely by looking, one could tell that their weapons had become much sharper.<br>&ldquo;The assimilation of the soldiers, that is the power of this Immortal Technique when it&rsquo;s mastered.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;When the soldiers are assimilated, the attack of that Immortal Technique is on par with an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill!&rdquo; Someone from outside cried out in alarm.<br>The rank nine Immortal Technique used by the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master was one that was extremely difficult to master even among all the martial skills and Immortal Techniques the Constellation Immortal Isle possessed.<br>It was so difficult that even Utmost Exalted-level experts would find it difficult to master.<br>The part that was most difficult to master would be the transformation that had happened just then.<br>If one could gain mastery over that transformation, the rank nine Immortal Technique&rsquo;s strength would rise to a higher level.<br>Its battle power would then be comparable to an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill.<br>&ldquo;Crap! Even if Chu Feng&rsquo;s protective formation is able to block the earlier attack, it will definitely not be able to withstand the incoming attack. That Immortal Technique has transformed to a higher level. Its power has surpassed the range of Immortal Techniques now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If Chu Feng doesn&rsquo;t flee now, he&rsquo;ll undoubtedly be killed.&rdquo;<br>Many experts of the older generation began to voice emotional comments.<br>&ldquo;Aouuuu~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right at that moment, Chu Feng waved his sleeve.<br>Boundless spirit power was released from his body.<br>Roars sounded repeatedly as light began to transform into a giant dragon.<br>The dazzling golden dragon was tens of thousands of meters long.<br>The mere swaying of that enormous dragon&rsquo;s tail caused the surroundings to crumble.<br>Confronted with the dragon&rsquo;s tail sweep, the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master&rsquo;s mastered rank nine Immortal Technique army shattered into pieces.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Witnessing this scene, without exception, shock filled the faces of both the people inside the Purple Star Variance Realm and those outside.<br></p></div>
