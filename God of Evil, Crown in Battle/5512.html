        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>The dissipated silhouettes inside the largest pool transformed into bundles of auras crackling with lightning, and they surged toward Chu Feng. The lightning around the auras came from the red lightning beast, just that the two powers had somehow perfectly fused.</span><br><span>Similar bundles of auras crackling with lightning also rose from the other pools and surged toward Chu Feng. These powers couldn&rsquo;t be used in battle, but there was bound to be a place to employ them.</span><br><span>Chu Feng guessed that this might have something to do with what the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief mentioned about &lsquo;completing the formation&rsquo;.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>The sculptures by the sides and the deepest region of the cavern suddenly kneeled to the ground and announced, &ldquo;We welcome the birth of the Monstrous Beast King!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Those words showed just how powerful Chu Feng&rsquo;s bloodline power was from their perspective. While these were nothing but a formation, it was still an impressive scene nevertheless.</span><br><span>&hellip;</span><br><span>However, the red lightning beast sneered upon hearing the compliment, &ldquo;Monstrous Beast King? What a joke! Even their so-called Monstrous Beast King is only worthy of kneeling in front of us!&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Elder, you&rsquo;re formidable! Those weaklings are nothing compared to you. Your means must be amazing too. It&rsquo;s a pity I&rsquo;m too weak to grasp your means now. I&rsquo;m really curious to know what kind of means it is,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a cheeky smile.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lad, are you trying to sound me out?&rdquo; the red lightning beast replied with a faint smile.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Not at all! I wouldn&rsquo;t dare to do something like that. I&rsquo;m just really curious to know what kind of means that is,&rdquo; Chu Feng honestly replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t count too much on it. Just think of it as another ordinary martial skill. However, remember that you only have one shot. Don&rsquo;t try to grasp it if you aren&rsquo;t absolutely confident of success,&rdquo; the red lightning beast said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I have taken your advice to heart, which is why I haven&rsquo;t attempted it yet. Your means surely can&rsquo;t be any martial skill,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.</span><br><span>All of a sudden, his smile froze in place and he fell to his knees.</span><br><span>He had just finished assimilating the lightning-infused auras he had absorbed. The energy they harnessed was incredible though they didn&rsquo;t contribute to his fighting prowess. It might have been because they had fused with his bloodline power, but he felt comfortable while the energy was assimilating into his body.</span><br><span>Yet, as soon as he fully assimilated the energy, the feeling of comfort vanished, and extreme pain assaulted him. The pain he was suffering now was what the red lightning beast had warned him about.</span><br><span>Chu Feng immediately took out the most valuable recovery pill he had received from the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and consumed it. He didn&rsquo;t think that it would come to play so quickly.</span><br><span>A surge of recovery energy quickly flooded his body, but the pain only continued to intensify. It was not that the pill was ineffective, but that the backlash was simply too severe.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t lie to you, right? I know that you&rsquo;re good at enduring pain, but this kind of pain can&rsquo;t be easily withstood. Your body suffered severe trauma, after all. Your cultivation is so weak that it can&rsquo;t even withstand a small portion of my power,&rdquo; the red lightning beast said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s excruciating, but it&rsquo;s all worth it since I got to see your means,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Bootlicker. I&rsquo;m leaving now. Any last words?&rdquo; the red lightning beast asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to thank you for helping me out. I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to clear this trial otherwise,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Spare the thanks. I intervened only because I can&rsquo;t stand how the formation looked down on your bloodline. From now on, you only have yourself to rely on. Some words of warning&mdash;this place isn&rsquo;t as simple as it seems. What you see may not be real.&rdquo;</span><br><span>As the red lightning beast said those words, the gate towering in front of Chu Feng slowly creaked open. On the other side of the gate was a beautiful realm filled with fragrant flowers and chirping birds that resembled a paradise.</span><br><span>Wu!</span><br><span>But Chu Feng fell to the floor before he could take a closer look at the realm.</span><br><span>All kinds of pain assaulted Chu Feng&rsquo;s body, and it grew stronger with each passing moment. He felt like his body was on the verge of breaking down.</span><br><span>It was excruciating beyond Chu Feng&rsquo;s wildest imagination, to the point where he could hardly process his thoughts. He could vaguely hear Eggy screaming at him, but he couldn&rsquo;t make out her words.</span><br><span>Just as he was about to faint, he heard an exceptionally clear voice echoing in his ears, &ldquo;Your bloodline power is formidable.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng was overjoyed. That was the same voice that had warned him that Long Chengyu and the others might encounter danger earlier. He could hear where the voice was coming from this time around&mdash;it was from right in front of him.</span><br><span>He tried to raise his head to see who it was, but a palm fell on his head and held him down. Following that, a warm surge of energy suffused his body and swiftly cured him of his pain.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Your courage is commendable. You barged into a place you never should have entered for the sake of your friends. Consider this compass your reward. It&rsquo;ll save your lives if you can decipher it, or else you&rsquo;ll all lose your lives here,&rdquo; that voice said.</span><br><span>The hand on Chu Feng&rsquo;s head was finally lifted. He immediately raised his head to see who had been helping him, but there was no one in sight. The other party had vanished without a trace, not leaving even the slightest aura behind.</span><br><span>However, he did notice an ancient bronze compass placed beside his feet. If not for it, he would have wondered if the conversation he had earlier was just an illusion.</span><br><span>No, it can&rsquo;t possibly be an illusion. The pain I suffered from channeling the red </span><span>lightning beast&rsquo;s power is so great that there&rsquo;s no way I could recover so quickly if a powerful individual hadn&rsquo;t helped me.</span><br><span>Chu Feng picked up the compass and examined it. It was a puzzle, and it didn&rsquo;t look like it could be easily solved. He found himself at a loss.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Thank you, elder.&rdquo; Chu Feng bowed in the direction where the other party was previously standing.</span><br><span>He finally turned his attention toward the opened door, which reflected a beautiful natural scenery, but he was more interested in the light pillars in the realm. All in all, there were 36 light pillars rising from the earth into the sky, as if forming a bridge between the two.</span><br><span>Those light pillars were extremely far away from him, but the light pillars were constructed with extremely powerful formations that naturally drew attention. Even a normal human being would have seen them even if they couldn&rsquo;t see the scenery around them.</span><br><span>Of the 36 light pillars, four of them showed anomalies.</span><br><span>One was wrapped in a dragon&rsquo;s silhouette.</span><br><span>One was wrapped in a phoenix&rsquo;s silhouette.</span><br><span>Two were wrapped in a blue qilin&rsquo;s silhouette.</span><br><span>&ldquo;This must be the formation the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief ordered us to complete,&rdquo; Chu Feng guessed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;The Blood-eyed Qilin Clan is formidable. They have already completed two formations. It looks like the Totem Dragon Clan has met its match,&rdquo; Eggy said.</span><br><span>If this had been a race to complete the formations, the Totem Dragon Clan was clearly in a disadvantageous position.</span><br><span>Even though Chu Feng had yet to fully recover, he endured the pain and flew into the realm. Eggy didn&rsquo;t attempt to dissuade him because she knew he was the type of person who wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to risk his life to save his friends. All she could do was quietly support him.</span></p></div>
