        <div>: Intolerable<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;<br>The woman turned to look at Chu Feng, but the moment their gazes met, Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes suddenly turned incredibly severe. She found her body shuddering in response as fear flickered across the depths of her eyes.<br>&ldquo;Sorry for disturbing you.&rdquo;<br>The woman quickly backed off fearfully.<br>But shortly after those women left, her male companions stood up and walked over.<br>&ldquo;Since you called him your future husband, it means that the two of you aren&rsquo;t married yet?&rdquo;<br>One of the men holding onto a foldable fan, seemingly the leader of the group, walked up and assessed Zi Ling intently with a smile on his lips.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng and Zi Ling had encountered far too many such situations. There was simply no lack of arrogant men in this world. Even if one didn&rsquo;t court trouble, trouble would still come knocking at one&rsquo;s doorstep.<br>Zi Ling didn&rsquo;t want to get involved with anything at the moment, so she chose to ignore the man and prepared to leave together with Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng got to his feet as well.<br>&ldquo;Miss, don&rsquo;t be in such a rush to leave.&rdquo;<br>But shortly after Zi Ling walked out of the tempering formation, the man suddenly flipped his fan open and blocked Zi Ling&rsquo;s path.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m already married. Please show some self-respect,&rdquo; Zi Ling said.<br>She was trying her best to suppress her anger, but her tone had already turned hostile. Chu Feng knew why Zi Ling was trying to hold her rage in because they were currently in a foreign environment, so she didn&rsquo;t want to get into any trouble here.<br>Otherwise, she would have already made a move on them.<br>&ldquo;Miss, I&rsquo;m a personal disciple from the Violet Omen Immortal Gazebo, Zhao Ruoshan. I can&rsquo;t bear the notion of a fairy like you being paired with a mere toad, so I would like to advise you to part ways with him. Look, do any of our brothers here pale in comparison to him?&rdquo;<br>The other male disciples behind him burst into laughter. Some of them even looked at Chu Feng in contempt.<br>Chu Feng held a high position in Zi Ling&rsquo;s heart. She could still keep her anger in check when those male disciples were disrespecting her, but the moment they directed their insults toward Chu Feng instead, her rage immediately erupted.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re courting death!&rdquo;<br>With killing intent in her eyes, she was prepared to strike at them.<br>But a palm suddenly fell on her shoulder the next moment. It was from Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to fight with them,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he pulled her behind him.<br>Zi Ling knew Chu Feng so well that she immediately realized what he was going to do. He was stopping her only so that he could deal with them himself. Given that they had already come to this point, Zi Ling knew that there was no need for her to try to stop him anymore.<br>These people deserved to be taught a lesson.<br>So, she stood obediently behind him.<br>However, the disciples from the Violet Omen Immortal Gazebo were still oblivious of the danger encroaching on them, especially for the man holding a foldable fan in his hand. He had a gleeful look on his face.<br>&ldquo;It looks like this toad still has some self-awareness. Since that&rsquo;s the case, I&rsquo;ll let you off the hook. I&rsquo;ll be frank here. I&rsquo;m interested in your woman, and if you don&rsquo;t want to die, give her to me. I&rsquo;ll compensate you,&rdquo; the man with the foldable fan said.<br>He wasn&rsquo;t even trying to negotiate here; he was ordering Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with you being interested in my woman. Given how outstanding she is, it&rsquo;s inevitable that there would be many men who would be interested in her. But what did you just say? You want me to give her to you?&rdquo;<br>A cold sneer formed on Chu Feng&rsquo;s lips as his gaze turned cold.<br>&ldquo;What if I refuse?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The man with the foldable fan had never thought of Chu Feng as a threat. Even when he sensed a strong hostility coming from Chu Feng, he still showed no intention of backing down at all. Instead, he chuckled softly and released his rank eight Utmost Exalted level oppressive might.<br>&ldquo;You should just step aside when you&rsquo;re told to!&rdquo;<br>The man with the foldable fan glared at Chu Feng with murderous eyes. He wasn&rsquo;t just joking around here; he was really intending to take Chu Feng&rsquo;s life.<br>However, his face suddenly stiffened. The next moment, he was sent flying.<br>Chu Feng had kicked him off.<br>The man with the foldable fan didn&rsquo;t fly too far away, but the moment he landed on the ground, everyone was shocked by what they had seen.<br>There was a bloody gorge in that man&rsquo;s abdomen.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re courting death!&rdquo;<br>They were probably too accustomed to getting their way that even after the man with the foldable fan was crippled within a single kick, the other disciples still immediately drew their weapons and exerted their oppressive might.<br>They were all at Utmost Exalted level, but even the strongest one of them was only at rank seven Utmost Exalted level.<br>They would definitely be considered as prodigies considering that they were all still juniors, but they were still lacking compared to the current Chu Feng.<br>Boom!<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s robe fluttered as he released his oppressive might, causing all of those disciples to collapse to the ground right away. The pressure was so great that their bones shattered and blood flowed from their seven apertures.<br>They were incapacitated just like that.<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo;<br>It was only then that they finally looked at Chu Feng with eyes filled with fear. They never thought that this humble-looking man before them would actually be a Martial Exalted level cultivator.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kill us! We&rsquo;re disciples of the Violet Omen Immortal Gazebo. If you kill us, our gazebo master will surely hunt you down!&rdquo;<br>They were threatening Chu Feng with those words, but their quivering voice betrayed their fear.<br>&ldquo;Cowards like you actually dare to fight with me over my woman?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng began making his way toward the man with the foldable fan.<br></p></div>
