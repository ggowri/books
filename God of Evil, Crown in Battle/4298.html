        <h1>Chapter 4297</h1>
        <div> - The Gazes From Afar<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes started to blaze with emotions. Excitement surged in his heart.<br>At this moment, he had seen through everything in this place.<br>But, the process was not simple at all.<br>After Xianhai Shaoyu called to his attention to examine this place, the first thing Chu Feng did was to use his strongest observational technique, his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes.<br>But, the Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes did not manage to help him see through this place.<br>In fact, his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes were unable to provide him with any assistance at all.<br>Even his world spirit techniques were unable to provide him with any help.<br>He felt as if his world spirit techniques and martial cultivation were both ineffective in this place.<br>It was only later that Chu Feng discovered that the layer of light that enveloped him possessed a guiding function.<br>Because of that, he began to attempt to link with the body of light...<br>Once he succeeded, he managed to see through this entire place.<br>He also realized why Xianhai Shaoyu deliberately dispersed the body of light that was protecting him and was using his body to withstand the terrifying powers.<br>Turns out, Xianhai Shaoyu was challenging the power of this place.<br>&hellip;...<br>Upon entering this place, if one possesses a strong enough talent, one will receive the body of light that surrounds one&rsquo;s body.<br>That body of light would protect them and endure their safety.<br>It could be said that it was the sign of this place&rsquo;s acknowledgement of their talent.<br>Only those with talent of a certain level would be able to receive that sort of acknowledgement.<br>That was shown at how both Chu Feng and Xianhai Shaoyu were acknowledged whereas Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er was evidently not acknowledged.<br>Once one is acknowledged and gains the layer of protection, they will be able to travel through this region safely. No matter how terrifying the power above their heads might be, no matter how it continued to attack them, they will not be harmed in the slightest.<br>Most importantly, should they attempt to link with the protective power, they will gain a clear understanding of this place and even control that protective power.<br>Should they disperse the protective power on their own will, they will be able to use their physical body to endure the terrifying power&rsquo;s attacks.<br>But, if that was all, Chu Feng would definitely not become so excited and emotional.<br>The reason for his excitement was because enduring the attacks of this place would be akin to issuing a challenge to the power of this place.<br>At the same time one issues a challenge, they will also be able to gain benefits.<br>The benefit was the reason why Chu feng was so excited.<br>It was a power that could strengthen one&rsquo;s soul and bloodline.<br>The power of this place would not be able to help them increase their cultivation.<br>But, it could allow them to gain a fundamental upgrade.<br>In simpler terms, once one strengthens one&rsquo;s bloodline&rsquo;s power, one&rsquo;s talent will also become stronger.<br>That also just so happened to be what martial cultivators needed the most.<br>After all, it was not enough for martial cultivators to put forth effort only.<br>Their talent was the most crucial aspect in determining what level of achievement one could reach in one&rsquo;s lifetime.<br>Strengthening one&rsquo;s talent was simply something that countless martial cultivators could only yearn for in their dreams.<br>Yet, this sort of dream could be accomplished by this place.<br>Of course, the greater of a challenge one endures, the greater of a reward one will gain.<br>As such, how much one could strengthen one&rsquo;s bloodline would be up to one&rsquo;s own abilities. It will depend on to what degree one could challenge this place.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, come join me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;While I would love to enjoy the benefits of this place myself, I know my capabilities. If I am to challenge this place on my own, I would not be able to gain this place&rsquo;s powers.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, join me. Let us share the power of this place.&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s voice was heard.<br>Chu Feng looked to Xianhai Shaoyu and saw that he was looking at him too.<br>Likely, Xianhai Shaoyu had determined that Chu Feng had learned the rules of this place from his expression.<br>A thing worthy of mentioning was the fact that Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s complexion had improved slightly.<br>At the very least, he was able to be much more at ease as he conversed with Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brother Shaoyu, if you can&rsquo;t handle it anymore, tell me. Do not try to force yourself,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Xianhai Shaoyu with a joking tone.<br>&ldquo;Haha. Brother Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re the one that shouldn&rsquo;t force yourself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This place is a place that relies on one&rsquo;s talent. And, in terms of talent, I, Xianhai Shaoyu, never feared anyone,&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;But that expression of yours, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like you&rsquo;re having an easy time,&rdquo; said Chu Feng with a smile.<br>&ldquo;You have no idea how painful it is to be struck by the power of this place.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll understand once you begin.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Your expression will definitely become uglier than mine,&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not necessarily going to be the case.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng smiled. As he spoke, the faint body of light surrounding him dispersed from his body.<br>&ldquo;Rumble---&rdquo;<br>The next moment...<br>Berserk thunderous roars---<br>Broiling fiery flames---<br>Whirling terrifying winds---<br>All rushed toward Chu Feng to ravage him.<br>Sure enough, it was as Xianhai Shaoyu said, Chu Feng&rsquo;s face immediately distorted the moment this place&rsquo;s power landed on him.<br>That power was no small matter. Ordinary people would simply not be able to withstand it at all.<br>But, Chu Feng was able to endure...<br>Furthermore, as time passed, Chu Feng gradually grew accustomed to the raving power.<br>That was likely the reason why Xianhai Shaoyu was grimacing in pain when he first saw him but was able to joke around with him later.<br>Just like this, Chu Feng and Xianhai Shaoyu jointly endured this place&rsquo;s power.<br>While the power of this place was extremely boundless, it was decreasing as it continued to attack Chu Feng and Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>Turned out, all the power that attacked them would enter into their bodies. In other words, the power of this place was being absorbed by them. However, the absorption process will bring about enormous pain.<br>But, the power that ended up being successfully absorbed by them will temper their souls and bloodlines, strengthening them in the process.<br>&hellip;...<br>But, the powers of this place were simply too boundless. If Chu Feng and Xianhai Shaoyu wanted to absorb all the powers here, they would have to continue to adapt nonstop.<br>Only by adapting to the intensity of the powers faster would they be able to absorb even stronger powers and at a faster rate.<br>What the two of them didn&rsquo;t know was that the power looked terrifying only because they were looking at it from the standpoint of being inside it.<br>If one was to look at the power from afar, it looked very beautiful.<br>It seemed like a cloud drifting in the vast starry sky.<br>Light roamed through the cloud. The surging lightnings created a small scenery in this endless starry sky. It was truly a breathtaking scene.<br>What Chu Feng and Xianhai Shaoyu didn&rsquo;t know either was that the beautiful scenery was being admired by some people.<br>There was actually a group of people standing in this vast starry sky and appreciating the terrifying yet beautiful lump of cloud from far away.<br></p></div>
