        <h1>Chapter 5434: Milord, Chu Feng is Here</h1>
        <div><span>v</span><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>Jia Chengxiong&rsquo;s heart clenched up upon hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s name. While he had been wanting to exact vengeance on Chu Feng, the latter had traumatized him so much that he instinctively shuddered upon hearing that name.</span><br><span>However, the World Spiritist Painter didn&rsquo;t stop just because of that. Jia Chengxiong was thrown out of the mountain valley.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng? He must be a fake, right? Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t be so dumb as to announce his arrival even if he is really here.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Indeed. He must be using Chu Feng&rsquo;s name to intimidate Jia Chengxiong.&rdquo;</span><br><span>The crowd quickly thought that Chu Feng was a fake, and that was exactly what Chu Feng was going for. It didn&rsquo;t matter whether he was telling the truth or not in here anyway since he could simply blend into the crowd after leaving this place.</span><br><span>The World Spiritist Painter proceeded to open another box, and countless sheets of paper flew out. While there was a limited number of brushes, it looked like there was a free-flow supply of papers. Having received both brush and paper, the crowd began to try their hands at making a painting.</span><br><span>Chu Feng was the only one who didn&rsquo;t make a move. Instead, he paid close attention to the paintings on the wall while trying to recall the method the World Spiritist Painter had imparted to them.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Everyone, you have two hours,&rdquo; the World Spiritist Painter announced.</span><br><span>Those words sent the crowd into a panic. Chu Feng was the only one who remained calm.</span><br><span>Time quickly passed by.</span><br><span>Most people struggled to even construct a formation with the brush, but a small portion of people managed to pick up on that trick.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hey, why hog on such a good brush when you aren&rsquo;t even going to draw? You might as well just give that brush to me!&rdquo; a voice echoed behind Chu Feng.</span><br><span>It was a man. He had made many decent attempts to manifest a formation with his brush, but he hadn&rsquo;t managed to succeed yet. It seemed like he had attributed the problem to his brush.</span><br><span>Chu Feng might have considered swapping brushes with him if he had talked things through nicely, but the other party&rsquo;s arrogant attitude happened to be something Chu Feng detested.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Your lacking control over spirit power is the reason you aren&rsquo;t able to form a formation. Why blame the brush?&rdquo; Chu Feng coldly pointed out the truth.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re saying that my control over spirit power is lacking? How interesting. I am only a small bit away from success. Why don&rsquo;t we have the crowd to prove whether I&rsquo;m right or not?&rdquo; the man spoke loudly.</span><br><span>Those words drew the crowd&rsquo;s attention.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Indeed. He&rsquo;s already close to success if he&rsquo;s already able to get that far.&rdquo;</span><br><span>The crowd nodded in agreement.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Do you see that? You are the only one who has no idea what&rsquo;s going on. The only thing holding me back is my brush. It&rsquo;s wrong of you to hog onto a good brush when you aren&rsquo;t going to draw at all. Hurry up and give it to me,&rdquo; the man ordered.</span><br><span>If not for the rule against fighting, the man would have probably snatched Chu Feng&rsquo;s brush.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Stop disgracing yourself here. Your &lsquo;small bit away from success&rsquo; is much larger than you think. You weren&rsquo;t listening to Lord Painter&rsquo;s words at all,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>Those words caught the World Spiritist Painter&rsquo;s attention.</span><br><span>Unwilling to accept Chu Feng&rsquo;s criticism, the man sneered, &ldquo;What a joke. Do you know who I am? I am the Pill Dao Immortal Sect&rsquo;s Jia Lianfeng!&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Jia Lianfeng? He&rsquo;s actually Jia Lianfeng?&rdquo;</span><br><span>More and more people were paying attention to the commotion.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Never heard of you,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied in disdain.</span><br><span>He didn&rsquo;t have a good opinion of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect in the first place, and the </span><span>fact that they were all self-assuming fools who thought that they could intimidate him by revealing their identities didn&rsquo;t help either.</span><br><span>&ldquo;How ignorant. It&rsquo;s one thing for you to impersonate Chu Feng, but you actually don&rsquo;t know Jia Lianfeng either. He used to be the most talented prodigy in the Pill Dao Immortal Sect! He has already reached Gray Dragon God-cloak despite only being 267 years old.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;You should give your brush up to him. It&rsquo;s selfish of you to hog onto it and hinder him!&rdquo;</span><br><span>The crowd began to criticize Chu Feng.</span><br><span>&ldquo;If you have been listening to Lord Painter&rsquo;s instructions, you wouldn&rsquo;t have been so caught up with the brush,&rdquo; Chu Feng said. He turned to the World Spiritist Painter and said, &ldquo;Master, I don&rsquo;t think that these people are worthy of your brush. Allow me to return this to you.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng threw the brush back to the World Spiritist Painter, who received it without any hesitation.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That fellow sure is disgusting. It&rsquo;s one thing for him to impersonate Chu Feng, but he&rsquo;s even disgusting others by doing stuff like that. He&rsquo;s trying to drag others down with him just because he is unable to pull it off.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Those are the kind of people I hate the most.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng was criticized by the crowd, but he turned a blind eye to their words. He was already used to the ignorant crowd running their mouths. Besides, there was a good chance that these people were just fawning at Jia Lianfeng even though it was meaningless to do so here.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Time is almost up. Those who haven&rsquo;t finished their painting yet should hurry up,&rdquo; the World Spiritist Painter reminded.</span><br><span>Chu Feng waved his sleeves and unfurled a sheet of paper.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What is that fellow doing? Why is he putting up an act when he doesn&rsquo;t even have a brush?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;There are all sorts of nonsensical people in the world of cultivation.&rdquo;</span><br><span>The crowd sneered.</span><br><span>Chu Feng paid them no heed and began drawing out a formation with his hand. His movements prompted the World Spiritist Painter, who had settled down on a chair, to shoot to his feet, and he watched Chu Feng with glowing eyes.</span><br><span>He was the only one who could tell how ingenious Chu Feng&rsquo;s means were.</span><br><span>The brush was indeed a good medium for drawing the painting, but true experts wouldn&rsquo;t require them. The ability to substitute one&rsquo;s hand as a brush was the highest realm for a painter. But this skill required time to learn, so how could someone grasp it so quickly?</span><br><span>Even the most intelligent person in the world shouldn&rsquo;t have been able to grasp it that quickly. The World Spiritist Painter himself took a thousand years before he finally grasped the method.</span><br><span>Yet, Chu Feng was painting adeptly with his hand. There was no pause in his movements as he completed his formation in a single breath.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Did that fellow really manage to pull it off?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Those who had mocked Chu Feng earlier were taken aback.</span><br><span>&ldquo;How could that be possible? He&rsquo;s just putting on a brave front. I reckon that his painting is completely different from what Lord Painter taught us,&rdquo; Jia Lianfeng sneered.</span><br><span>He refused to believe that Chu Feng could complete a painting within such a short period </span><span>of time without a brush when he had struggled so much over the last two hours.</span><br><span>Chu Feng began to fuse the formation with the paper. With a brilliant glow of light, the painting impeccably showed on the paper. It depicted the mountain valley they were in, including those who were present here at the moment.</span><br><span>The painting was so lifelike that it looked as if the people inside would move despite it being a still portrait. Even those who knew next to nothing about art were shaken by it.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Did that fellow really manage to pull it off without a brush?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Who in the world is he?&rdquo;</span><br><span>An uproar broke out amidst the crowd.</span><br><span>Even the woman who had first entered this mountain valley, the one whom Chu Feng suspected to be Jia Lingyi, also looked at him with a conflicted look on her face. With a wave of her sleeves, she destroyed the formation before her.</span><br><span>She had also grasped the painting method and had produced a decent painting, but she knew that it was meaningless as soon as she saw Chu Feng&rsquo;s painting. There was no way she could outdo his painting.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What a wonderful painting!&rdquo; The World Spiritist Painter rushed over to Chu Feng&rsquo;s side and lavished compliments on him. &ldquo;Young friend, why don&rsquo;t you put your name on this beautiful painting?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; Chu Feng wrote his own name on the painting.</span><br><span>The name &lsquo;Chu Feng&rsquo; astonished the crowd, and the woman&rsquo;s eyes grew even colder.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is he really Chu Feng? Is Chu Feng really that talented as a world spiritist?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The endless outpour of compliments for Chu Feng left those who had previously humiliated him feeling ashamed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s end the competition. The one who is qualified to enter my private gallery is young friend Chu Feng. Please, come with me,&rdquo; the World Spiritist Painter said before leading Chu Feng toward the door.</span><br><span>No one raised any objections, for there was no other painting here that could match Chu Feng&rsquo;s. Even the paintings displayed in the mountain valley paled in comparison.</span><br><span>Walking through the door, Chu Feng found himself in a palace filled with artwork. Some of these artworks were hung up on the wall, whereas others were simply floating in mid-air. A gate could be seen at the other end of the palace, but the gate was tightly shut.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young friend, the paintings in here aren&rsquo;t just my own creations. Some of the masterpieces of the other painters too. Take your time admiring the paintings. I still have matters to attend to, but I&rsquo;ll be right back,&rdquo; the World Spiritist Painter said before taking his leave.</span><br><span>Chu Feng was curious about the tightly shut gate, but he decided to take a look at the paintings first. The artworks here were indeed masterpieces worth learning from. He started with the paintings on the wall before moving to those floating in mid-air.</span><br><span>All of a sudden, he noticed a painting of scenery that looked awfully familiar. It resembled a place in the Nine Provinces Continent. The painter who had signed off on it was also a familiar name.</span><br><span>Qing Xuantian!</span><br><span>Meanwhile, the World Spiritist Painter had arrived at the entrance of a grand palace located in the depth of Painter Mountain. He walked up to the entrance and bowed deeply, saying, &ldquo;Milord, Chu Feng is here.&rdquo;</span><br></p></div>
