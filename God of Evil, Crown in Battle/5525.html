        <h1>Chapter 5525: Destroy!</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re strong! They aren&rsquo;t just at rank seven Half-God level, right?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;They should have raised their cultivation up to rank eight Half-God level,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>Both Long Chengyu and the Blood-eyed Qilin Clansman were rank five Half-God level cultivators, but the strength they were exerting now was comparable to that of rank eight Half-God level cultivators. In other words, they were able to raise their cultivation by three ranks!</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>A figure was suddenly slammed into the earth. It was Long Chengyu. He was wielding a gleaming golden sword, which was the God Armament he had previously obtained, but even so, the situation didn&rsquo;t look optimistic.</span><br><span>There was a hole in his chest, and his body was covered in burn marks. He was in an extremely frail state, almost having lost his ability to fight.</span><br><span>The shockwaves in the sky finally dissipated, revealing the ugly rank five Half-God level Blood-eyed Qilin Clansman.</span><br><span>He was ten times larger than his original size, and his outer appearance had morphed from a human appearance into that of a monster. Blood-red aura could be seen rippling from him, producing an intense blood stench. Tinges of red light could be spotted in between his blue scales, making him look sinister.</span><br><span>However, there were also several fatal wounds on his body too, and he was bleeding non-stop. In fact, he had also lost an arm too. It could be seen that the Blood-eyed Qilin Clansman had to pay a huge price to curb Long Chengyu in the battle.</span><br><span>Held in the Blood-eyed Qilin Clansman&rsquo;s remaining arm was a huge saber covered in exquisite blue scales that looked reminiscent of an artwork. Its overwhelmingly powerful aura indicated that it was a God Armament!</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all there is to the Totem Galaxy&rsquo;s strongest prodigy.&rdquo; The Blood-eyed Qilin Clansman looked at Long Chengyu with a triumphant gaze.</span><br><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way you could have defeated me if not for you sacrificing the lives of your brethren!&rdquo; Long Chengyu roared angrily.</span><br><span>Those words suggested that the huge casualties amongst the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan were caused by the rank five Half-God level cultivator and not the Totem Dragon Clan. He must have used a secret skill to siphon his clansmen&rsquo;s bloodline power and boost his strength.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hahaha! My clansmen are willing to sacrifice themselves for me. What do you have to complain about? You can only blame your clansmen for not having the courage to do the same. Your cowardice is the reason all of you are going to die here today,&rdquo; the Blood-eyed Qilin Clansman said as he readied himself to kill Long Chengyu.</span><br><span>Just as he was about to make a move, Long Chengyu suddenly vanished. Wails echoed shortly after.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Milord, save us! Save us!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Long Muxi and the other Totem Dragon Clansmen, including the deceased, suddenly disappeared too. At the same time, the Blood-eyed Qilin Clansmen found themselves trapped inside a barrier. The barrier contained a watermelon-sized formation that was overflowing with killing intent.</span><br><span>The rank five Half-God level Blood-eyed Qilin Clansman hurriedly dove down to save his fellow clansmen from the barrier. While he was attempting to destroy the watermelon-sized formation, a voice suddenly echoed from the air.</span><br><span>&ldquo;The Blood-eyed Qilin Clan deserves to go extinct.&rdquo;</span><br><span>The rank five Half-God level Blood-eyed Qilin Clansman looked up and saw Long Chengyu, Long Muxi, and the Totem Dragon Clansmen floating in the air. The wounded Long Chengyu and Long Muxi were being supported by Long Yuhong and Long Zhizhi.</span><br><span>However, the one standing at the forefront of the group wasn&rsquo;t a Totem Dragon Clansman but Chu Feng.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng? You&rsquo;re the one who did this?&rdquo; the rank five Half-God level Blood-eyed </span><span>Qilin Clansman stared at Chu Feng in disbelief.</span><br><span>Even though Chu Feng had activated the Lightning Mark, Lightning Armor, and Lightning Wings, his cultivation only reached rank six Half-God level. It shouldn&rsquo;t be possible for Chu Feng to save the Totem Dragon Clansmen under his watch.</span><br><span>After all, the rank five Half-God level Blood-eyed Qilin Clansman had raised his cultivation to rank eight Half-God level!</span><br><span>&ldquo;Remember. All of your clansmen are going to die today because of you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hahaha!&rdquo; The rank five Half-God level Blood-eyed Qilin Clansman burst into contemptuous laughter. &ldquo;A mere rank three Half-God level cultivator like you can&rsquo;t possibly do anything to me. Even if you raise your cultivation by three ranks, you&rsquo;re still nothing but a rank six Half-God trash. Someone of your caliber dreams of killing me?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The Totem Dragon Clansmen were also perplexed as to how Chu Feng was going to deal with the Blood-eyed Qilin Clansmen. His opponent was a rank eight Half-God level who had a God Armament in possession. If not for that, Long Chengyu wouldn&rsquo;t have fallen in defeat.</span><br><span>Chu Feng glanced at the watermelon-sized formation and said, &ldquo;That is enough to kill you.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>The rank five Half-God level Blood-eyed Qilin Clansman slammed his claw down on the formation, crushing it into bits. He then looked at Chu Feng with a provocative smile, saying, &ldquo;You think that this weak formation of yours can take my life?&rdquo;</span><br><span>A split moment later, he hurriedly retracted his claw. It turned out that a token shrouded in golden lightning and red flames were hidden inside the formation. Most important of all, the token was emanating the aura of the Ancient Era</span><br><span>However, the Totem Dragon Clansmen looked disappointed to see the token. They naturally recognized the Lightning Flame Token. As precious as it was, it only wielded the power to destroy anyone beneath Half-God level.</span><br><span>There was no way it would work on a rank eight Half-God level Blood-eyed Qilin Clansman.</span><br><span>Some of the Totem Dragon Clansmen wondered if Chu Feng had intentionally brought the Lightning Flame Token out to intimidate the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan. If he could just momentarily distract the rank five Half-God level Blood-eyed Qilin Clansman, they might just be able to buy enough time to escape from here.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hahaha!&rdquo; The rank five Half-God level Blood-eyed Qilin Clansman burst into laughter. &ldquo;I was wondering what kind of treasure you were going to bring out, but it turns out to be the Lightning Flame Token. Did the Totem Dragon Clan not tell you that the token is only capable of dealing with cultivators beneath Half-God level?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The Totem Dragon Clansmen&rsquo;s faces paled in despair. They hadn&rsquo;t expected the rank five Half-God level Blood-eyed Qilin Clansman to recognize the Lightning Flame Token.</span><br><span>Just then, Chu Feng formed a series of hand seals and said, &ldquo;See you.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>Terrifying crimson flames interweaved with golden lightning enveloped the vicinity, unleashing a force so great that it shattered the surrounding space and scorched both the earth and the sky black.</span><br><span>While the shattered space was swiftly restored, all of the Blood-eyed Qilin Clansmen had already lost their lives!</span></p></div>
