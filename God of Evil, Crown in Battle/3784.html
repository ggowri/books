        <h1>Chapter 3783</h1>
        <div> - Coincidental Encounter?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Void Cleanse Monastery. Their exploration of the remnant was rather laid-back. Because of that, the elders were allowed to leave at will.<br>After Chu Feng left, Song Ge also left the Ancient Era&rsquo;s remnant.<br>That said, Song Ge could be considered to be a celebrity in the Void Cleanse Monastery.<br>As such, it was very easy for Chu Feng to ask where Song Ge went.<br>There was a city near the Seven Suns Mountain Range. Song Ge was currently inside that city.<br>Although the area around the Seven Suns Mountain Range was very vast, the vastness differed according to the individual. With Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation, he would be able to reach the Seven Suns Mountain Range in a very short period of time.<br>Thus, in merely an instant, Chu Feng had arrived at the city after leaving the remnant.<br>Although the city was vast, it was unable to escape Chu Feng&rsquo;s discerning eyes, and Chu Feng soon discovered Song Ge.<br>Chu Feng was able to see that she was currently with a young woman. That woman was also a female elder of the Void Cleanse Monastery. Coincidentally, Chu Feng happened to know that woman too.<br>She was Aunty Liu&rsquo;s daughter, Wang Lian.<br>Song Ge and Wang Lian were not the only people present. There were also other people with them.<br>There were of both genders. Most of them were men. Furthermore, they all wore gorgeous clothes. It seemed like they were all from wealthy families.<br>Those people were not from the Void Cleanse Monastery. Instead, they were from a different sect.<br>Those people must&rsquo;ve encountered Song Ge accidentally. Several of the men from that group revealed extraordinarily favorable impressions towards Song Ge.<br>Those people were currently inviting her to enjoy some tea at a teahouse. However, Song Ge didn&rsquo;t want to enjoy tea with them.<br>Although she was uninterested, Wang Lian revealed deep interest, and was trying hard to urge Song Ge to go.<br>From the expression in Wang Lian&rsquo;s eyes, Chu Feng was able to tell that she was not at all interested in enjoying tea in the teahouse. Instead, she was interested in the men.<br>Although those men were completely worthless in terms of strength and status for someone like Chu Feng, they were optimal spouse candidates for someone like Wang Lian.<br>In fact, if Wang Lian was able to get together with any one of those men, she would be climbing the social ladder.<br>Although Wang Lian had acted extremely arrogant and proud when she met Chu Feng previously, she was extremely eager and attentive toward those men.<br>Although Song Ge was very cold towards those men, she found it difficult to refuse Wang Lian.<br>At that moment, Song Ge had entered a very difficult predicament.<br>Chu Feng knew that it was time for him to step onto the stage.<br>Thus, he walked out of the shadows and deliberately walked past Song Ge, pretending it was an accidental encounter.<br>&ldquo;Asura?&rdquo;<br>Sure enough, with Chu Feng&rsquo;s deliberation, Song Ge soon discovered him.<br>After all, Chu Feng was Song Ge&rsquo;s savior.<br>On top of that, he had chatted with her about many things after saving her. Thus, Song Ge, who felt extremely grateful towards Chu Feng to begin with, had a much more favorable impression of him.<br>After seeing Chu Feng, Song Ge was not only beaming with happiness, but she even took several rapid steps and ran over to him.<br>&ldquo;What a coincidence. Never would I have imagined that I'd meet you here,&rdquo; Song Ge said whilst smiling like a blooming flower after seeing Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It is indeed a coincidence.&rdquo; Chu Feng revealed a pleasantly surprised look.<br>&ldquo;Who is that person?&rdquo;<br>When those men who were fond of Song Ge saw Chu Feng, they all started frowning. Displeasure was clearly visible in their eyes.<br>They'd been trying so hard to befriend Song Ge earlier. Yet, they were only met with her contempt.<br>However, when she saw Chu Feng, she immediately turned into a completely different person. This caused them great envy and displeasure.<br>&ldquo;Why would it be him?&rdquo;<br>At the moment when the men were sizing Chu Feng up, Wang Lian also turned her gaze to Chu Feng.<br>She didn&rsquo;t have to examine him, because she recognized who he was the instant she saw him.<br>&ldquo;Elder Wang Lian, you know that person?&rdquo; Those men asked Wang Lian.<br>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say that I know him.&rdquo;<br>In Wang Lian&rsquo;s eyes, Chu Feng was a shameless and despicable person. However, that was not what was important. Most importantly, she felt that Chu Feng was nothing more than trash.<br>Because of that, she felt that he was unqualified to even know her.<br>Thus, she found it beneath her to tell others that she knew him.<br>Although she was unwilling to admit that she knew Chu Feng, she was very curious as to how he and Song Ge knew one another.<br>Thus, she arrived before them.<br>&ldquo;Song Ge, how do you know him?&rdquo; Wang Lian asked Song Ge.<br>&ldquo;Wang Lian, that would be a long story. I will tell you when there&rsquo;s time,&rdquo; Song Ge said to Wang Lian.<br>After hearing Song Ge&rsquo;s words, Wang Lian glared fiercely at Chu Feng. Then, she pulled Song Ge behind her and pointed her finger at Chu Feng. With a threatening tone, she said, &ldquo;Let me tell you this! From today on, keep your distance from Song Ge! Otherwise, don't blame me for becoming impolite with you!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Wang Lian, what are you doing?&rdquo; Seeing that Wang Lian was actually speaking to her benefactor in such a manner, Song Ge felt displeased.<br>&ldquo;Song Ge, I&rsquo;ve met that person before. He is not a good individual. Don't be deceived by him,&rdquo; Wang Lian said to Song Ge.<br>&ldquo;What nonsense are you spouting?&rdquo; Song Ge was completely baffled.<br>In her impression, Chu Feng was her benefactor, and an exceptional genius.<br>How could he be a swindler?<br>&ldquo;Elder Song Ge, Elder Wang Lian, is something the matter?&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, those men and women all gathered around.<br>Among them, the few men with the highest cultivations and greatest interest in Song Ge began to size up Chu Feng with extremely ill-intended gazes.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no issue. He&rsquo;s my friend," Song Ge hurriedly explained.<br>&ldquo;Friend? Elder Song Ge&rsquo;s friend must not be an ordinary individual. Brother, may I know which sect&rsquo;s elder you might be?&rdquo;<br>The men looked to Chu Feng strangely.<br>&ldquo;I belong to no sect. My name is Asura," said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What? Asura? Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this, you&rsquo;re an Asura World Spiritist? If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, brother Asura must be an Asura World Spiritist, right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Otherwise, why would you be named Asura?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Everyone, am I not right? Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right, right, right. Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the crowd started laughing heartily. Even Wang Lian laughed with them.<br>Seeing that, Chu Feng revealed a faint smile.<br>Those people were laughing because they were ridiculing him.<br>Chu Feng was smiling because he was also ridiculing them for how ignorant they were.<br>&ldquo;Well then, Elder Song Ge, it&rsquo;s a rare encounter for us to meet. It&rsquo;s better that we go to the Cyan Bamboo Teahouse to enjoy some tea together.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right. I&rsquo;ve heard that the Cyan Bamboo Teahouse has introduced several rare teas recently. Those teas are all the best of the best.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, they&rsquo;ve found an extremely beautiful Natural Oddity. It would be great for us to go there and check it out.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Elder Song Ge, you should know about the Cyan Bamboo Teahouse, no? The shopkeeper of the Cyan Bamboo Teahouse is a Martial Immortal-level expert. His teahouse is renowned for its unique performances.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Enjoying tea in the Cyan Bamboo Teahouse is not something that just anyone can do.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is especially true today. The Cyan Bamboo Teahouse has hired an extremely marvelous Natural Oddity to sing and dance there. Because of that, it&rsquo;s completely packed, and extremely difficult to get a seat.&rdquo;<br>The men began to persuade Song Ge once again.<br>However, Song Ge showed absolutely no interest.<br>It was instead Chu Feng who asked, &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s that difficult to enter the teahouse, how are we supposed to enter it?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng deliberately asked that question. After all, the words spoken by those men earlier served merely as a setup so that they could show off to Song Ge.<br>Unfortunately, Song Ge did not react the way they hoped because she was uninterested.<br>Chu Feng, on the other hand, was feeling mischievous. He wanted to see how they were planning to show off.<br></p></div>
