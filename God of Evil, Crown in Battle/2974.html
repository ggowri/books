        <div> - Teach You Resistance<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Lingxi, are you willing to fuse with the Ten Souls Pearl now?&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.<br>&ldquo;Father, am I able to fuse with it now?&rdquo; Hearing those words, Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s eyes simply started shining. She would naturally want to fuse with the Ten Souls Pearl right away.<br>&ldquo;Father can help you. If you do not mind, we can start right here,&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa said.<br>&ldquo;Here? Is that possible?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi was very astonished. While she wanted to fuse with the Ten Souls Pearl quickly, she had truly never imagined fusing with it before all those people.<br>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s possible. Father can help you,&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa said.<br>&ldquo;Very well, what&rsquo;s there to wait for then, quickly, help me,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi was extremely excited.<br>After that, Chu Xuanzhengfa began to help Chu Lingxi fuse with the Ten Souls Pearl.<br>The process was extremely magnificent. The sky was covered with surging lightning. It was simply even more astonishing than ordinary abnormal signs.<br>With the situation being like this, many people in the Chu Heavenly Clan noticed, and same over.<br>When the crowd found out that Chu Lingxi was currently fusing with the Ten Souls Pearl, and that it was Chu Feng who had helped Chu Lingxi obtain the Ten Souls Pearl, they were all enormously astonished.<br>That said, when Chu Feng became the focus of the crowd, he had arrived at Chu Yue&rsquo;s side.<br>He discovered that Chu Yue had never joined the crowd. She was kneeling in the corner and crying.<br>&ldquo;Big sis Chu Yue, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Little brother Chu Feng, I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m truly too useless,&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s arrival caused Chu Yue to cry even more.<br>&ldquo;Did you fail?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; Chu Yue nodded.<br>Seeing this, Chu Feng originally wanted to comfort Chu Yue. However, at the moment when he wanted to speak, a voice transmission entered his ears.<br>&ldquo;Little brother Chu Feng, can you hear me?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng turned his gaze. A man was standing several thousand meters away from Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I can hear you, is there something you need from me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I will secretly tell you one thing. However, you absolutely must not tell anyone that it is I who told you this,&rdquo; that man said.<br>&ldquo;Very well, go ahead,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied through voice transmission.<br>&ldquo;With big sis Chu Yue&rsquo;s speed, she was originally capable of passing the Sacred Domain Selection. Unfortunately, she was blocked. The people that blocked her were Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s subordinates. I personally heard from those people&rsquo;s mouths that it was Chu Haoyan who secretly gave them an order to stop Chu Yue from advancing and passing the Sacred Domain Selection,&rdquo; that man said.<br>&ldquo;My thanks,&rdquo; Chu Feng expressed his thanks and said no more.<br>Chu Feng knew very well that that man told him this matter because he realized his potential and wanted to befriend him.<br>In the end, it was for personal benefits, and not out of kindness. Thus, Chu Feng did not need to overly thank him.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng looked to Chu Yue and spoke quietly, &ldquo;Big sis Chu Yue, did you fail to pass the Sacred Domain Selection because you were stopped by others?&rdquo;<br>Chu Yue was startled upon hearing those words. After hesitating for a moment, she nodded.<br>&ldquo;You should know that those people were Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s subordinates, right?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; Chu Yue nodded again.<br>&ldquo;In that case, do you know if they were instructed to stop you by Chu Haoyan?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked again.<br>Chu Yue hesitated again. However, in the end, she nodded again.<br>&ldquo;Then what use is there for you to cry here?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;What else can I do? That is Chu Haoyan. Even if I am to tell the elders about this, it would still be useless. Not only will they not admit that he was wrong to do so, but even if they were to admit to it, no one would condemn Chu Haoyan. After all, something like this is a common occurrence in the Chu Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; Chu Yue said.<br>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re planning to continue to submit to humiliation like this? Are you planning to submit to humiliation for the rest of your life in the Chu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>At that moment, Chu Yue suddenly clenched her hands that were grabbing onto her skirt. She was quiet for a moment before finally saying quietly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not. But what can I do?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine if you do not know what to do.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I, Chu Feng, will teach you what you should do today,&rdquo; at that moment, Chu Feng stood up.<br>As for Chu Yue, she had a completely confused expression on her face as she looked to Chu Feng.<br>Seeing Chu Yue&rsquo;s confused expression, Chu Feng said, &ldquo;Resist.&rdquo;<br>As he said that word, Chu Feng began to walk toward Chu Haoyan.<br>When Chu Feng approached Chu Haoyan, Chu Xuanzhengfa just happened to have finished helping Chu Lingxi fuse with the Ten Souls Pearl.<br>At that moment, the Ten Souls Pearl disappeared. The crowd all knew that the Ten Souls Pearl had entered Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s body. After all, this process was something that they had witnessed with their own eyes.<br>However, there was no change to Chu Lingxi at all. She appeared no different from before she had fused with the Ten Souls Pearl.<br>However, the crowd knew that Chu Lingxi was no longer the same. Her cultivation speed would become faster. She will become their Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s strongest genius.<br>No, not the strongest. After all, there was still Chu Feng.<br>There was still Chu Feng, who had become an Exalted-cloak World Spiritist at his young age. It was him&hellip; who had helped Chu Lingxi obtain the Ten Souls Pearl.<br>When they thought of this, the crowd began to search for Chu Feng. And it just so happened that Chu Feng was walking over himself.<br>Seeing Chu Feng walking over, Chu Lingxi hurriedly moved toward him.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I&rsquo;ve succeeded. I truly do not know how to thank you. If it wasn&rsquo;t for you, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to obtain the Ten Souls Pearl,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi was extremely sincere when she said those words. She was feeling truly grateful toward Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great that you&rsquo;ve succeeded. How do you feel now?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a smile on his face.<br>&ldquo;I feel very good,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great. Since that&rsquo;s the case, help me witness this,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Ah? Witness what?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi asked in a very confused manner.<br>It was not only her; the great majority of the people present were also confused.<br>Why would Chu Feng suddenly say that sort of thing?<br>Right at the moment when the crowd were confused, Chu Feng suddenly walked over to Chu Haoyan.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve won our contest earlier,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Of course. Many people have seen that, there&rsquo;s no need for you to tell me that I&rsquo;ve won, we all know that I&rsquo;ve won,&rdquo; Chu Haoyan spoke in a very proud manner.<br>After all, Chu Feng was no longer just someone who had managed to ascend to the Heavenly Lightning Steps&rsquo; tenth step, but he was also an Exalted-cloak World Spiritist who had successfully helped Chu Lingxi subdue the Ten Souls Pearl.<br>Chu Haoyan would naturally feel extremely proud to have won against such a Chu Feng.<br><br><br></p></div>
