        <div> - Hunting Team<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Shangsong, what is the meaning of this?! Are you trying to plot against Lord Father?!&rdquo;<br>A furious shout was heard. It was Long Shangsong&rsquo;s second brother, Long Shangjue.<br>Even though Long Shangjue had a furious expression on his face and seemed like he wanted to slaughter Long Shangsong, he was actually completely overjoyed.<br>He had always wanted his little brother to make a fool of himself. However, his little brother had been extremely cautious in the way he handled things the entire time. Never had he ever had any moments of carelessness.<br>Thus, Long Shangjue was very surprised to see his little brother fall head first onto the ground at that moment.<br>Even though this came very suddenly, it had provided him with an enormously pleasant surprise.<br>Of course, he could not express his joy, but he must still properly seize the opportunity to teach his little brother a lesson.<br>&ldquo;Shangsong, why are you not responding?! Could it be that you&rsquo;re admitting it to be true, that you&rsquo;re really planning to plot against father?!&rdquo; Long Shangjue questioned again.<br>&ldquo;Second brother, that&rsquo;s not&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How could I dare do that?&rdquo; Long Shangsong shook his head.<br>Long Shangsong&rsquo;s face was completely covered in blood, but he did not dare to even wipe the blood from his face. Just like that he turned around and knelt before his father.<br>&ldquo;Lord Father, this was not done by me. This truly had nothing to do with me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d obtained a Dragon Vein Yin Yang Stone.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why it would turn into this.&rdquo;<br>Long Shangsong tried his hardest to explain. But, he didn&rsquo;t know how to explain things.<br>Suddenly, he recalled something. With that, he came to a realization.<br>&ldquo;Lord Father, I&hellip; I got it! Someone must&rsquo;ve switched out the Dragon Vein Yin Yang Stone for that poison gas.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that guy. It&rsquo;s that guy. He&rsquo;s the one who changed it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Father, I&rsquo;m not lying to you. Lord Supreme Elder can testify for me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Someone changed the Dragon Vein Yin Yang Stone to cause me harm,&rdquo; said Long Shangsong.<br>&ldquo;Lord Sectmaster, this subordinate can testify.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is indeed the case.&rdquo;<br>The Supreme Elder that had journeyed with Long Shangsong knelt and began testifying.<br>What they said was the truth. Even though the two of them were unwilling to admit it, they both realized that they had been plotted against by Chu Feng<br>It turned out that the hesitation he had shown back then hadn't been because he was afraid.<br>Rather, he had been buying time so that he could secretly mess with the Dragon Vein Yin Yang Stone.<br>However, it was clear that by the time they realized what Chu Feng had done, it was already too late.<br>&ldquo;Thus, the two of you were played for fools by someone?&rdquo; the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster asked with a stern voice.<br>&ldquo;Lord Father, you must uphold justice for me.&rdquo; Long Shangsong seized the opportunity to kneel before his father. With a look of grievance, he accused Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Uphold justice?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll uphold your fucking ass.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I had our Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s strongest world spiritist accompany you, yet this is the kind of pleasant surprise you brought back?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You useless trash. You&rsquo;ve thoroughly disappointed me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I had known that you&rsquo;d be this useless, I wouldn&rsquo;t have brought you into this Endless Abyss.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I should&rsquo;ve given this precious opportunity to your elder brothers instead.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Scram! Scram immediately! Get out of my sight!&rdquo;<br>As the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster shouted in rage, he waved his sleeve and sent forth surging martial power that sent Long Shangsong flying.<br>&ldquo;Lord Sectmaster, please quell your anger. It is this subordinate that is incompetent.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Actually, when young sectmaster obtained that Dragon Vein Yin Yang Stone, he had first handed it to me to inspect it. But this old man failed to detect that anything was wrong with it. This old man&rsquo;s failure is worthy of ten thousand deaths.&rdquo;<br>The Supreme Elder immediately began to kowtow and beg for forgiveness.<br>However, the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster did not turn his anger onto the Supreme Elder.<br>That Supreme Elder was one of his trusted aides. He knew very well how capable he was.<br>The reason why he had assigned the Supreme Elder to his youngest son was because he thought very highly of his youngest son.<br>But what happened had made him extremely disappointed in his son.<br>After all, he had been made a fool of, all because of Long Shangsong.<br>The fact that he was made a fool of even though he was the sectmaster would naturally cause him to be furious.<br>However, after calming himself, he had also realized that he could not blame his youngest son for what happened.<br>His youngest son had been played by that youth.<br>Not even his Supreme Elder had been able to detect any faults with the Dragon Vein Yin Yang Stone. Thus, it was only natural that his youngest son would not be able to detect any faults either.<br>&ldquo;Are you certain that it was a trick that was played on you by that youth?&rdquo; asked the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;There are two possibilities.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Either the Dragon Vein Yin Yang Stone itself was a fake, or that youth did something to it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, regardless of which possibility it might be, they&rsquo;re both related to him,&rdquo; said the Supreme Elder with a look of certainty.<br>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s the first possibility, I can understand.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But if it&rsquo;s the second possibility, then the youth you spoke of would be rather remarkable,&rdquo; the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster narrowed his brows.<br>After all, this Supreme Elder was a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.<br>If he had been able to mess with the Dragon Vein Yin Yang Stone before his eyes without him noticing, it meant that his world spirit techniques were extremely strong.<br>It would also mean that he was most definitely not an ordinary fellow.<br>&ldquo;In any case, for him to dare to not place our Nine Principles Dragon Sect in his eyes means that he has committed a capital offense.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;From now on you don&rsquo;t have to follow Song&rsquo;er.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Instead, you are to follow Jue&rsquo;er. The two of you are to go and capture that youth. If he&rsquo;s alive, I want to see him. If he&rsquo;s dead, I want to see his corpse,&rdquo; said the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;Yes, Milord.&rdquo;<br>The Supreme Elder, Long Shangjue and the old lady all answered at the same time.<br>&ldquo;Jue&rsquo;er, do not disappoint father,&rdquo; the Nine Princinples Dragon Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster said to his second son.<br>&ldquo;Lord Father, please rest assured, I will definitely capture that guy for you,&rdquo; Long Shangjue spoke with confidence.<br>He felt that this was an opportunity for him to bring about a change to his future.<br>After all, his little brother had suffered at the hands of that youth.<br>If he was able to capture him alive, then he would most definitely be able to obtain his father&rsquo;s acknowledgement.<br>Perhaps his status in his father&rsquo;s heart would be able to surpass his little brother&rsquo;s.<br>This was an opportunity that would only appear once in a blue moon. He was determined to seize it.<br>Thus, Long Shangjue, the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s Supreme Elder and a powerful world spiritist formed a very powerful team.<br>With the goal of hunting down Chu Feng, they set off in the Endless Abyss!<br>After Long Shangjue and the others left, the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster sat down cross-legged and continued with his training.<br>Even though he had realized that a very powerful world spiritist might&rsquo;ve entered the Endless Abyss, he remained calm and composed.<br>It was as if everything was still within his control, and he did not have to worry about the future in the slightest.<br></p></div>
