        <div> - Powerless To Reverse The Situation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the people from the Zhao Mansion were dumbstruck.<br>The elders and disciples of the Grand Mountain Monastery were also dumbstruck.<br>Even Song Xi was dumbstruck.<br>Song Xi truly never imagined that the overlord of the region surrounding the Sacred Mountain, the Grand Mountain Monastery&rsquo;s headmaster who was akin to a legend, a deity, was actually unable to withstand a single palm strike from Chu Feng.<br>When even Song Xi did not anticipate this, it would be even more the case for the people from the Zhao Mansion and the Grand Mountain Monastery.<br>[1. Did Song Xi not know the cultivation of the headmaster? Chu Feng defeated Chu Xianshuo, a rank four True Immortal yo!]<br>After all, the Grand Mountain Monastery&rsquo;s headmaster was a rank two True Immortal. How could he&hellip; not even take a single attack from Chu Feng?<br>&ldquo;Father, what is happening?! Didn&rsquo;t you say that Chu Feng was only a rank one True Immortal?!&rdquo; Zhao Zirong asked furiously.<br><br>As a son, he was actually furious at his father.<br>However, his reaction was normal. It would instead be strange if he wasn&rsquo;t furious.<br>Generally, it would always be the son that would disappoint one&rsquo;s father, placing one&rsquo;s father in a difficult situation. However, it was his father who had placed him in a difficult situation.<br>&ldquo;I-I-I remember that he was only a r-rank one True Immortal. W-Who knows w-what has happened to him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It s-should be impossible for him to have increased his cultivation in such a short period of time. Despicable, truly despicable! He had concealed his cultivation!&rdquo;<br>The Zhao Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master looked to his son. He had no idea how to explain what was happening. Afterall, he too was panicking.<br>&ldquo;Puu~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a muffled sound was heard. An explosion occurred beside him. Blood splattered all over the Zhao Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master.<br>It was one of their Zhao Mansion&rsquo;s trusted aides. He had died. His body had exploded to pieces and his blood splattered everywhere.<br>Naturally, it was Chu Feng who had killed him.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze was like a burning torch. Yet, they were emitting cold light. Like a murderous god, he was walking in the sky toward the people from the Zhao Mansion.<br>&ldquo;Apart from the people from the Zhao Mansion, those who doesn&rsquo;t want to die can leave.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng spoke coldly. His voice was thunderous and filled with intimidation.<br>Once those words were spoken, all of the elders and disciples from the Grand Mountain Monastery reacted like startled birds. They all soared into the sky.<br>They were truly frightened. They did not even dare to waste time to pack their possessions, and immediately started fleeing.<br>In the blink of an eye, only the people from the Zhao Mansion and that seriously injured headmaster remained in the Grand Mountain Monastery.<br>When Chu Feng finally descended from the sky, he did not immediately attack the people from the Zhao Mansion. Instead, he turned his eyes toward the Grand Mountain Monastery&rsquo;s headmaster.<br>The reason for that was because the Grand Mountain Monastery&rsquo;s headmaster had stood back up. Furthermore, he was planning to flee.<br>When he discovered that Chu Feng was looking at him, he immediately started to smile apologetically.<br>&ldquo;Milord, I am not from the Zhao Mansion. I also do not wish to make an enemy of you. All the things I&rsquo;ve done were forced by them,&rdquo; the Grand Mountain Monastery&rsquo;s headmaster spoke with a grievance-filled tone.<br>&ldquo;You should use those words to deceive King Yama.&rdquo;<br>[2. Yama is the King of Hell.]<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he shot forth a punch at the Grand Mountain Monastery&rsquo;s headmaster.<br><br>Martial power surged forth. The speed of Chu Feng&rsquo;s attack was so fast that the Grand Mountain Monastery&rsquo;s headmaster was simply unable to react. Chu Feng&rsquo;s punch landed on his body.<br>&ldquo;Bang!&rdquo; The Grand Mountain Monastery&rsquo;s headmaster shattered to pieces. Like the elder before him, he met a violent death by Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Sssss~~~&rdquo;<br>Seeing this scene, everyone from the Zhao Mansion turned green in the face with fear. They were so scared that their hearts were about to jump out of their bodies. There were even those that were more cowardly that started to piss their pants in fear.<br>It was only at that moment that they realized how foolish of a decision it was to continue to make an enemy of Chu Feng.<br>At that moment, even their intestines had turned green with regret.<br>&ldquo;Lord Chu Feng, please spare me. Lord Chu Feng, please spare me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This lowly one knows his wrongs now, this lowly one knows his wrongs now. Please, Lord Chu Feng, give me another chance.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the Zhao Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master kneeled on the ground and began to smash his head forcefully into the ground to kowtow to Chu Feng. He seemed to be trying to smash his skull to pieces so as to obtain Chu Feng&rsquo;s forgiveness.<br>It was not only him. Everyone from the Zhao Mansion, including that Zhao Zirong, was kneeling on the ground, kowtowing and begging Chu Feng for forgiveness.<br>&ldquo;I have already given you all a chance. Yet, you didn&rsquo;t cherish it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, rest assured. I will not kill you all immediately,&rsquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Hearing those words, joy emerged in the eyes of the people from the Zhao Mansion. They actually thought that Chu Feng would spare them.<br>&ldquo;Milord, as long as you do not kill me, I will do anything you want me to do,&rdquo; said the Zhao Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master.<br>&ldquo;Huu~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng waved his sleeve. The next moment, a vast amount of blue flames emerged from Chu Feng&rsquo;s sleeve. The flames landed on the people from the Zhao Mansion.<br>&ldquo;Eeaaahhh~~~&rdquo;<br><br>The next moment, the people from the Zhao Mansion started to scream miserably. Their screams were akin to the wailing of ghosts and howling of wolves.<br>Those screams were extremely miserable. The reason for that was because they were currently suffering unbearable pain.<br>Seeing the people from the Zhao Mansion screaming like that, there was no trace of sympathy in Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes. Instead, coldly, he said, &ldquo;I will have you all burn to death. I will have both your minds and souls extinguished.&rdquo;<br>Seeing all this, Song Xi was stunned with fear.<br>Even though he had been acquainted with Chu Feng for some time now, and knew how powerful he was, he felt that he only came to know the actual Chu Feng at that moment.<br>He truly never expected that the Chu Feng that was cheerful and lively, that kind-hearted and honest Chu Feng, would actually have such a ruthless side to him.<br>He was truly a cold-blooded killer, someone who killed without blinking an eye.<br>However, after doing all that, there was no trace of joy on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face. Instead, he revealed an even more grief-filled gaze.<br>He waved his sleeve. &ldquo;Bang!&rdquo; A palace in the Grand Mountain Monastery shattered apart. At that moment, a weak figure emerged from that palace.<br>This person was none other than Song Xi&rsquo;s mother.<br>&ldquo;Mother, mother!&rdquo;<br>Seeing his mother, Song Xi immediately flew over and embraced his mother.<br>&ldquo;Xi-boy, don&rsquo;t be scared, mother is fine, mother is alright.&rdquo;<br>Although Song Xi&rsquo;s mother possessed a low level of cultivation, she was much more composed than him.<br>Even though she was clearly seriously injured, she did not reveal the slightest bit of panic. Instead, she started to console her son.<br>&ldquo;Aunt, please take this medicinal pellet. It will bring relief to your pain.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng arrived before Song Xi&rsquo;s mother and fed her a medicinal pellet. After that, he set up a healing formation to help Song Xi&rsquo;s mother heal her injuries.<br>Being treated by both Chu Feng&rsquo;s medicinal pellet and spirit formation, Song Xi&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s injuries soon healed. She was no longer weak and without strength when speaking.<br><br>Seeing that his mother was becoming more and more healthy, Song Xi grew more and more cheerful.<br>However, even though Song Xi and his mother had reunited, the grief in Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes grew more and more intense.<br>Chu Feng had discovered where Song Xi&rsquo;s mother was imprisoned at the very beginning.<br>That was also the reason why he was so furious and sad.<br>The reason for that was because he had realized that Song Xi&rsquo;s mother had been severely tortured to extort information from her.<br>In fact, she had been forcibly awakened from her deep sleep through malicious means.<br>Because of that, Song Xi&rsquo;s mother had suffered severe and incurable injuries. Right now, she was already on the verge of death.<br><br>Even Chu Feng was powerless to reverse the situation. Song Xi&rsquo;s mother would not be able to live for long.<br>All that Chu Feng could do would be to try his best to extend her remaining time.<br>However, even with that being the case, Song Xi&rsquo;s mother would not be able to live for even three more days.<br><br><br></p></div>
