        <h1>Chapter 4606</h1>
        <div>: You&rsquo;re Thinking Too Much<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Ahhh, how delicious. The Dark Demon is indeed as delectable as rumors claim. It looks like my effort to lure you out wasn&rsquo;t in vain.&rdquo;<br>After devouring the Dark Demon, a look of intoxication appeared on Song Yun&rsquo;s face, making it seem as if she had just enjoyed a huge feast.<br>&ldquo;M-m-monster! You aren&rsquo;t a human! You are a monster!!!&rdquo;<br>Having just witnessed an inhuman horror with his own eyes, Yin Tianchou could hardly retain his composure. He had followed his powerful master around since a young age, which built up his knowledge about the affairs of the world. It was from his master that he learned about the Dark Demon.<br>No one knew where the Dark Demon had come from, and no one had been able to estimate the true extent of its prowess either. But one thing that everyone knew was that the Dark Demon was frighteningly powerful, and its lethal poison made it a horror to deal with.<br>The Dark Demon was able to morph into a gaseous form, and if one were to breathe it in, one would lose his life right away. Given so, devouring the Dark Demon was an unthinkable concept to anyone who knew about its nature.<br>Yet, the young lady standing before him actually devoured the Dark Demon and even relished in it.<br>Furthermore, based on what she had just said, her aim here wasn&rsquo;t the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl at all but the Dark Demon. In other words, her reason for going for the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl was actually to lure the Dark Demon out.<br>&ldquo;Speaking of which, I should really thank you. I do know a thing or two about the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl, but what I know about the Dark Demon is quite limited. I have only heard rumors that it would appear on its own accord once the pearl has been taken.<br>&ldquo;If not for you, I might still have to take the trouble of racking my mind to think of a way to lure the Dark Demon out. So, how should I thank you for this then?&rdquo;<br>Song Yun said as she walked up to Yin Tianchou with a smile.<br>She had already reverted back to her original appearance&mdash;an inncoent face with eyes that were curved into crescents and a beautiful smile. She was as beautiful as one could imagine.<br>Yet, she instilled so much fear in Yin Tianchou that the latter found himself losing control over his bladder.<br>&ldquo;Young miss, if you really want to thank me, why don&rsquo;t you let me go?&rdquo; Yin Tianchou cried desperately.<br>&ldquo;Let you go? How can I do that? You gave me an earnest compliment by calling me &lsquo;delectable&rsquo;, and you helped me to lure the Dark Demon out after that. You can be considered as my benefactor now. It would only be right for me to repay the favor to you.&rdquo;<br>As Song Yun spoke, her crescent eyes suddenly opened wide, revealing her blood-red pupils. The sharp fangs in her mouth also made a reappearance too.<br>Even though there was still a smile lingering on her mouth, her smile had transformed from a sweet one to a vicious one.<br>Gahhh!<br>For a long period afterward, all that could be heard in the area was a guttural cry coming from Yin Tianchou. It crescendoed into a peak before gradually fading into silence.<br>By the time the echoes vanished, Song Yun had already returned back to her original appearance. Yin Tianchou, on the other hand, was nowhere to be seen. The only trace left of him was the silver bowl that Song Yun was holding in her hand.<br>&ldquo;How disgusting. Pui!&rdquo;<br>Song Yun spat at the place where Yin Tianchou was lying previously. After that, she walked over to Chu Feng&rsquo;s side and placed the silver bowl back where it was.<br>It was after all was done that she opened her mouth and blew softly at Chu Feng.<br>A slight breeze carrying a refreshing aroma drifted across the air, inducing the unconscious Chu Feng to slowly open his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Y-you&rsquo;re fine?&rdquo;<br>As soon as Chu Feng regained his consciousness, his body shot up, and he began assessing Song Yun carefully.<br>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; Song Yun replied sweetly.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re&hellip; saved?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng assessed his surroundings, only to find that they were out of danger. He had no idea how, but they had managed to escape from the world inside the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl.<br>&ldquo;Not only so, but we managed to obtain the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl too. It&rsquo;s all thanks to you. Big brother Chu Feng, do you not remember anything at all?&rdquo; Song Yun asked with doubt in her eyes.<br>Her gaze was so sincere that it actually made Chu Feng doubt his own memories.<br>&ldquo;Are you saying that I was the one who helped you obtain the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s thanks to you! I came under attack as soon as I entered the world inside the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl. Everything was blurry and fuzzy after that. I vaguely saw your silhouette inside the world before passing out altogether.<br>&ldquo;By the time I regained my consciousness, we were already out here, and the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl is also in my hands,&rdquo; Song Yun said.<br>&ldquo;Oh? Can I have a look at the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just an ordinary pearl. I already ate it,&rdquo; Song Yun replied.<br>&ldquo;You already ate it? How are you feeling right now then?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I feel good. I think that my illness shouldn&rsquo;t pose any trouble now. It&rsquo;s all thanks to you, big brother Chu Feng. How can I ever repay your favor? I owe my life to you&hellip; Shouldn&rsquo;t I offer myself to you in return then?&rdquo;<br>Song Yun looked at Chu Feng with a bright smile.<br>&ldquo;Offer yourself my head! You&rsquo;re just a small child who hasn&rsquo;t fully grown out yet. What in the world is your head filled with!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng stood up and assessed his surroundings for a while before he turned to look at Song Yun again, &ldquo;Are you really alright now?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m fine now. The Divine Rejuvenation Pearl has worked its magic. But big brother Chu Feng, do you really not remember anything at all anymore?&rdquo; Song Yun asked with feigned doubt.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember it anymore. I only recall myself getting attacked after entering that world, and shortly after, I fell unconscious.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyebrows were tightly knitted as he tried his best to recall the incident, hoping to remember what he did afterward. However, nothing came to mind at all. His memories stopped at the point where his life was hanging by a thread under the relentless absorption of his energy.<br>&ldquo;Ah, that reminds me. Big brother Chu Feng, there was a faint light coming from your body earlier on, and a bizarre aura burst forth from you. It was only for an instant though. Could it be from something you&rsquo;re carrying?&rdquo; Song Yun asked.<br>&ldquo;Something I&rsquo;m carrying?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng began patting his body down, but the only thing he could find was the silver bowl.<br>He chose to carry this silver bowl on him instead of putting it into a Cosmos Sack because he had been examining it all this while. He wanted to see if it was possible for him to sever the relationship between this silver bowl and Yin Tianchou.<br>He knew that this silver bowl was a rare treasure, and he dearly wanted to take it for his own possession. Unfortunately, he hadn&rsquo;t been able to figure a way to sever the relationship thus far.<br>&ldquo;Hmmm? This feeling&hellip; Could it be that&hellip;&rdquo;<br>However, when Chu Feng touched the silver bowl once more, his eyes widened in astonishment.<br>To his shock, he could no longer feel Yin Tianchou&rsquo;s aura from it anymore. Somehow, the connection between Yin Tianchou and the silver bowl had been severed!<br>But why would the connection suddenly disappear?<br>He could only think of two possibilities behind this.<br>Either Yin Tianchou had taken the initiative to cancel his own connection with the silver bowl&mdash;though this was unlikely because it would deal a huge damage to him&mdash;or that he was dead.<br>Needless to say, Chu Feng was leaning toward the second possibility.<br>But this brought up yet another doubt. How in the world did Yin Tianchou die here?<br>Unless Yin Tianchou were to encounter the prodigies of the Gongsun Clan and got killed by them, or else there was probably no one who could pose a threat to him here. But given Yin Tianchou&rsquo;s wits, he wouldn&rsquo;t be so foolish as to provoke the prodigies of the Gongsun Clan.<br>That scoundrel might be arrogant, but he wasn&rsquo;t stupid.<br>In any case, Chu Feng felt that there were many doubts surrounding this matter.<br>&ldquo;Could it be that I&rsquo;m dreaming?&rdquo; Chu Feng murmured under his breath.<br>Be it escaping from the world inside the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl or the severing of the connection between silver bowl and Yin Tianchou, these two matters obviously had something to do with him, but he didn&rsquo;t recall doing anything at all.<br>He must have either lost his memories, or something that he was unaware of had happened.<br>With such thoughts in mind, he turned his eyes to Song Yun.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, big brother Chu Feng?&rdquo; Song Yun asked with large, innocent eyes.<br>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s nothing much. My head just feels a bit heavy. I think I haven&rsquo;t fully awakened yet,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a shake of his head.<br>To be honest, he was indeed a bit doubtful of Song Yun, but her innocent eyes convinced him that he was really just thinking too much into it.<br></p></div>
