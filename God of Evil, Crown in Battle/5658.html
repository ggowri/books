        <h1>Chapter 5658: A Step Closer to the Secret, the Female True God</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng was traveling through a glowing teleportation tunnel while being enveloped in a surge of teleportation energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Teleportation tunnels weren&rsquo;t anything special; anyone who stepped into a teleportation formation would find themselves inside a teleportation tunnel. However, Chu Feng was still awed by the teleportation tunnel he was in, for the traveling speed was beyond his wildest imagination. Every wisp of teleportation energy here must have originated from a priceless treasure, and the teleportation tunnel was made up of countless wisps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was inconceivable to Chu Feng!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I would have never believed there could be such a potent teleportation formation in the world if I hadn&rsquo;t seen it with my own eyes. I wonder what&rsquo;s the secret hidden in the Nine Heavens Secret Domain?&rdquo; Chu Feng was getting increasingly intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was brought into this teleportation formation when the key formation he had constructed fused together with the towering mysterious gate. He deduced that the Nine Heavens Secret Domain&rsquo;s true secret lay at the other end of the tunnel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hours later, he finally stepped out of the teleportation tunnel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a quick scan of his surroundings, he realized that he was inside a stone hall, and he was standing on top of a pedestal located at the center of the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind him was a ten thousand meters tall golden gate. This gate was not connected to any wall; it stood standalone like a sculpture. It was far more exquisite than the mysterious gate he had passed through earlier. Lingering remnants of teleportation energy could be felt from it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was through this gate that Chu Feng arrived here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Other than the fact that the gate was an invaluable treasure, he couldn&rsquo;t find any deeper secret to it. It was just the destination of a powerful teleportation formation. However, its aura was very old, suggesting that it was from the same era as the mysterious gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hall Chu Feng was currently in had an old aura too, but it was likely constructed in the Ancient Era, whereas the two gates were likely from the Immemorial Era. This showed that the gates were constructed before the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng took another look at his surroundings. At the two opposite ends of the hall was a stone door each. One of them led deeper into the stone hall, whereas the other one led to the entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng&rsquo;s attention was drawn to the stone door that led deeper into the stone hall, or to be exact, the mural on it. He could tell that the mural contained an incredibly ingenious world spiritist technique. It could greatly boost the concentration of his psyche, possibly strengthening his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes and formation construction means.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While grasping this world spiritist technique wouldn&rsquo;t raise his spirit power, it would significantly boost his fighting prowess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only a pity that the world spiritist technique on the stone door was incomplete, though he found clues suggesting that the complete world spiritist technique could be found beyond the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Is this world spiritist technique the secret of the Nine Heavens Secret Domain? No, </span><span>that&rsquo;s not right.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng initially refuted the notion that the formidable world spiritist technique was the secret of the Nine Heavens Secret Domain, but he soon changed his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Nine Heavens Secret Domain was constructed in the Immemorial Era, whereas the hall was constructed in the Ancient Era. At first glance, the world spiritist technique couldn&rsquo;t have been the secret of the Nine Heavens Secret Domain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it was also possible that the hall was constructed around the true secret of the Nine Heavens Secret Domain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Could it be possible that someone in the Ancient Era discovered the secret here and intentionally built this stone hall to conceal it?&rdquo; Chu Feng wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stone door had a keyhole, suggesting that it had to be opened with a corresponding key. Chu Feng tried searching the stone hall, but he couldn&rsquo;t find the method to manifest the key.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Despicable!&rdquo; Chu Feng cursed, though he refused to give up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, he made his way toward the stone door leading to the entrance, which was not locked off. He pushed the stone door open and entered a stone passageway. There were no traps in the passageway; he passed through it without a hitch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the other end of the passageway was another stone pedestal surrounded by a hundred stone tablets. These tablets were linked to the stone pedestal, and they had runes inscribed on them. It was a teleportation formation constructed in the Ancient Era.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng quickly grasped the way to activate the teleportation formation. He stepped into the formation and channeled it. Moments later, he was transported to a bamboo forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bamboo forest was devoid of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s aura, except for the item beneath his feet. What was right beneath his feet wasn&rsquo;t earth but a teleportation formation that was identical to the one he had just channeled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of the teleportation formation was a massive stone monument. This stone monument wasn&rsquo;t from the Ancient Era; it was constructed by someone in the present era. Inscribed on it were the words &lsquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s forbidden land. Those who trespass will be killed without mercy!&rsquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect? Isn&rsquo;t the Nine Heavens Secret Domain under the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s control? Why did it lead to the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s territory? Something feels amiss about this place too. Am I not in the Seven Realms Galaxy anymore?&rdquo; Chu Feng was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the distance between starfields was massive, let alone the distance between galaxies. Weaker cultivators could take tens of thousands of years to travel from one galaxy to another. No one would believe him if he said that he traveled from one galaxy to another in less than two hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furthermore, the Seven Realms Galaxy was in the Southern Region, whereas the Heavenly Dome Galaxy was in the Western Region. There was a great distance between the two, making this feat even more implausible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t think that it was too implausible when he considered how </span><span>potent the teleportation formation was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Could the Nine Heavens Secret Domain&rsquo;s secret be the ability to traverse across galaxies within a short period of time?&rdquo; Chu Feng murmured as he scanned his surroundings using his Heaven&rsquo;s Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was no different from an ordinary mortal in terms of external appearances, but the strength he harnessed was no different from that of a god to those from the Lower Realm. He could peer a far distance away with his Heaven&rsquo;s Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could see a forest beyond the bamboo forest, followed by an ocean behind. These hinted that he was no longer in the Nine Heavens Secret Domain, though he couldn&rsquo;t tell if he was in the Seven Realms Galaxy or the Heavenly Dome Galaxy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyebrows suddenly shot up, as he noticed a brilliant light above the ocean. It was as bright as the sun, and it swiftly spread into the distance. Huge waves rose from the ocean, as a furious gale ravaged the shore. The trees near the ocean were uprooted and torn into shreds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the earth beneath Chu Feng&rsquo;s feet rumbled with increasing intensity, and a deafening explosion ensued. Shockwaves rippled above the ocean and swept outward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone was fighting!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fight was happening far away, in the center of the ocean, but the water level was quickly receding from evaporation. The shockwaves from the battle were boiling the ocean water. This made Chu Feng realize that the two fighters were incredibly powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;They must at least be at True God level,&rdquo; Chu Feng deduced. &ldquo;This feeling!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng tore his eyes away from the battlefield to look at the forest. He noticed another surge of teleportation energy coming from the bamboo forest, so he quickly rushed over to check out the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon arriving at his destination, he saw an exquisite stone dagger from the Ancient Era plunged in the ground. The inscriptions on the dagger were similar to the ones he had seen in the stone hall earlier. They were likely to be the handiwork of the same person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The teleportation energy was coming from the dagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A brilliant light flashed from the dagger, and a woman appeared above the dagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman was initially shocked to see Chu Feng, then killing intent filled her eyes. But before she could make a move, she suddenly fell to the ground and passed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only then that Chu Feng realized that the woman had suffered a heavy palm strike to her chest that caused her seven apertures to bleed. It was the culprit behind her passing out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, her face remained unharmed, and surprisingly, it was a familiar face to Chu Feng.</span></p></div>
