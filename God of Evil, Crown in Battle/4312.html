        <h1>Chapter 4311</h1>
        <div> - Strongest Genius<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chu Feng was slightly surprised to see Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s current expression.<br>A special expression appeared on Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s face when he spoke of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. It was not there when he was speaking about the other powers.<br>It was a look of reverence.<br>Seeing that look on Xianhai Shaoyu, Chu Feng knew that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion was an extraordinary place.<br>&ldquo;Could it be that there&rsquo;s people stronger than the Mansion Master in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Your guess is right on target. Indeed, there&rsquo;s people in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion not weaker than their Mansion Master.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, I&rsquo;ve heard that there might be someone even stronger than the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master in the Sacred Mansion,&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Someone stronger than the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Who is that person?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt increasingly astonished.<br>From the descriptions provided by Xianhai Shaoyu, he already knew that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion master was extremely powerful.<br>But now, Xianhai Shaoyu actually said that there was someone in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion stronger than the Mansion Master. Oh how powerful of an existence must that be?<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s something that I am not certain about. After all, it is merely a rumor.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That being said, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master was already an expert standing at the utmost apex of the vast martial cultivation world.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If there really exists someone even stronger than the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master, that person&rsquo;s strength will be stronger than all the experts in the vast martial cultivation world.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, I have no idea exactly who that person is.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In fact, I don&rsquo;t even know if that person even exists.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Regardless, brother Chu Feng, you merely need to keep this in mind. After you leave the Holy Light Galaxy, you can provoke any power. But, you must not provoke the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion could be said to be the most unfathomable power in the martial cultivation world right now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not only do they possess countless experts in the older generation, even the younger generations are emerging with experts in innumerable succession.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is especially true regarding that Jie Ranqing.&rdquo;<br>The look of reverence in Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s eyes grew even more intense when he mentioned Jie Ranqing.<br>No, it was not only a look of more intense reverence. Fiery emotions could be seen in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Is that Jie Ranqing a person of the younger generation like us?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;No. While Jie Ranqing is not very old, she would still be considered to be a senior for us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Her current age should be over five hundred.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, Jie Ranqing was praised as the strongest genius to have ever appeared in the history of the martial cultivation world,&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;The strongest genius to have ever appeared in the history of the martial cultivation world?&rdquo;<br>Those words perked Chu Feng&rsquo;s curiosity.<br>The strongest genius in the history of the martial cultivation world, that reputation was no small matter.<br>&ldquo;She was publicly accepted to be that.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;While all the powers in the martial cultivation world are proud and arrogant, not a single power dared to refuse to acknowledge her for her talent to be the strongest.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Flowing through her body is the Ruler&rsquo;s Bloodline. That is the bloodline deemed to be the strongest among all world spiritist bloodlines.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;While the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion possesses an innumerable amount of expert world spiritists, she is the only person to possess the Ruler&rsquo;s Bloodline,&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s that powerful?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng grew increasingly more curious about Jie Ranqing.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not all. Jie Ranqing also possesses another power that surpassed ordinary people,&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Another power that surpassed ordinary people? What sort of power is that?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, as you&rsquo;re a world spiritist, you should know that every world spiritist is born with the connection with a single spirit world, correct?&rdquo; asked Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>&ldquo;Among the spirit worlds, the strongest is the Asura Spirit World, correct?&rdquo; asked Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Correct,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded again.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, which spirit world are you linked with?&rdquo; asked Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;The Asura Spirit World,&rdquo; answered Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Apart from the Asura Spirit World, are you linked with any other spirit world? Asked Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Of course not. Didn&rsquo;t you mention earlier that world spiritists are only linked with a single spirit world that&rsquo;s determined at birth?&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why Jie Ranqing is so amazing.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;She is able to link with all seven spirit worlds,&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Linked with all seven spirit worlds? Wouldn&rsquo;t that mean that she is able to summon world spirits from all seven spirit worlds?&rdquo; asked Chu feng.<br>&ldquo;Correct. She is capable of that. Now, do you know how extraordinary she is?&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Ssss---&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t help but suck a mouthful of cold air after hearing those words.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s accomplishments had often toppled the understanding of ordinary people.<br>But, today, someone completely toppled Chu Feng&rsquo;s understanding.<br>To be able to enter contracts with world spirits from all seven spirit worlds was simply something that Chu Feng had never imagined before.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not all. She is also able to step over the barrier of the spirit world and enter into the spirit worlds,&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Enter into the spirit worlds?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng grew even more astonished. At the same time, his expression turned slightly complicated. The feeling within his heart began to change from one of simple astonishment.<br>&ldquo;It must be shocking, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Calm yourself. I&rsquo;ve still not reached the important part.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If she merely possesses exceptional talent, she might not necessarily be acknowledged by the entire martial cultivation world.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do you know how she came to be acknowledged by the entire martial cultivation world?&rdquo; asked Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; Chu Feng grew pressed.<br>&ldquo;Maybe it is the will of heaven. Or maybe it&rsquo;s a coincidence. But, over five hundred years ago, exceptional geniuses appeared in all the various powers throughout the entire martial cultivation world.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right now, all the geniuses from five hundred years ago had matured into exceptionally powerful individuals.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of that, five hundred years ago was deemed to be the most fortunate era for the vast martial cultivation world.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, while the geniuses of her era are all exceptionally powerful, none could match Jie Ranqing. In fact, if those geniuses are compared to her, they will all be an entire tier inferior to her.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Back when they were all people of the younger generation, the various powers gathered together to hold a sparring competition between the people of the younger generation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;At that time, all the geniuses were gathered. Only Jie Ranqing was not present.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As those geniuses had never fought one another before, they all felt themselves to be superior to their competitors.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of that, Jie Ranqing who was already renowned for her fame before their laughing stock.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;They all felt Jie Ranqing was someone with only fame but no courage. They believed that she was afraid to even spar with them and did not live up to her reputation as a genius.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, to their surprise, at the time when the sparring session was about to end, at the time when only the few most reputed geniuses of the younger generation remained on the competition, Jie Ranqing suddenly appeared.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;She didn't even move a finger. With a mere thought and using purely her spirit power, she suppressed all those geniuses to the ground, rendering them unable to move a single step.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Using her strength, she proved that the geniuses of the younger generation were simply unworthy of being compared with her.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Reportedly, the oppressive might unleashed from her spirit power was so strong that even the people of the older generation were trembling with fear.&rdquo;<br>The more Xianhai Shaoyu spoke, the more excited he became. From the tone of his voice, one could tell that his feelings for Jie Ranqing had surpassed admiration and entered a level of idolization.<br>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s actually that powerful?&rdquo;<br>Hearing the descriptions from Xianhai Shaoyu, Chu Feng also feld endless admiration toward Jie Ranqing.<br>He had always known that there were people more talented than him in the wider world.<br>But, he never imagined for there to be such a genius in this vast martial cultivation world.<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, for some unknown reason, several tens of years ago, it was announced that Jie Ranqing entered closed-door training. Till this date, she had yet to reemerge.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of that, I&rsquo;ve never had the chance to pay my respect to this genius who had stunned the entire martial cultivation world.&rdquo;<br>Xianhai Shaoyu suddenly sighed with regret.<br>But, hearing Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s unintentional comment and sigh, an enormous wave rose in Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart!<br></p></div>
