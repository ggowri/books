        <div> - Devote One&rsquo;s Life<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing that, Wuming Xingyun felt that what Chu Feng had said was justified.<br>For the Tantai Heavenly Clan to deceive Chu Feng like that, anyone would feel displeased should they be in his shoes.<br>&ldquo;This old man has a question for you. Have you discovered that the Tantai Heavenly Clan was deceiving you sooner, would you have accepted their gifts?&rdquo; Wuming Xingyun asked.<br>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t, since they are two completely unrelated matters,&rdquo; Chu Feng answered.<br>&ldquo;If they are to become my enemies in the future, I can very well fight for and seize those treasures from them. I can plunder all of their Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s possessions. I will also not care about their clansmen either. However&hellip; there's no reason for me to accept their gifts.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if they were to become my friends where we help one another, I would naturally accept the gifts. It would instead be wrong for me to try to snatch their possessions.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Merely, at this moment, the Tantai Heavenly Clan's opinion of me is still unknown,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Never would I expect that you would consider things so thoroughly at such a young age,&rdquo; Wuming Xingyun revealed a look of admiration.<br>Since he had already warned them of what he needed to warn them about, even if the Tantai Heavenly Clan was to meet with a calamity in the future, Chu Feng would not feel any remorse or guilt.<br>Currently, Chu Feng and the Tantai Heavenly Clan were still strangers without too deep of a friendship. Thus, he naturally could not accept their gifts.<br>Even though he ultimately accepted four Exalted-level Sacred Temple Beads, he only accepted them symbolically because he was forced to by the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. Thus, his actions were not excessive at all.<br>Wuming Xingyun felt that what Chu Feng had done was very correct.<br>If it had been another person of the younger generation, they would definitely not act in the same manner as him.<br>First of all, the great majority of the younger generation would not be able to resist the enticement of such gifts.<br>Furthermore, had it been some other member of the younger generation, even if they knew that the Black-feathered Specter was very dangerous, they would not warn the Tantai Heavenly Clan so as to prevent needless troubles.<br>That was how human nature was...<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s manner of conduct had made Wuming Xingyun even more certain that he possessed a very rare and even scarce personality in the current martial cultivation world.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, although I don't know why that girl Li Ruochu sought you out, the Li Heavenly Clan and your clan aren't in a very friendly relationship right now. Although that girl is a very reliable person, her clansmen are not reliable and forthright at all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, Chu Feng, if you plan to go to the Li Heavenly Clan, let this old man accompany you there,&rdquo; Wuming Xingyun said.<br>&ldquo;Senior, there&rsquo;s no need for that. It's better to allow us to settle the grudges between our clan and the Li Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, if possible, this junior has one thing that I wish to ask for senior&rsquo;s help with,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Speak away,&rdquo; said Wuming Xingyun.<br>Chu Feng then mentioned his request.<br>Chu Feng wanted Wuming Xingyun to protect Wuma Shengjie and the others till they had left safely.<br>Wuming Xingyun naturally gladly accepted this request.<br>Then, Chu Feng, accompanied by Li Ruochu, began to proceed toward the Li Heavenly Clan.<br>Li Ruochu was a tactful person. She did not ask Chu Feng what had happened in the Tantai Heavenly Clan.<br>Instead, she began to inform Chu Feng about the spirit formation that Li Yue&rsquo;er had entered.<br>That spirit formation was called the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Formation.<br>It was not without reason that it was named the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Formation. That spirit formation was what had helped the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s ancestors establish their clan.<br>That Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Formation was also their lifeline.<br>The Li Heavenly Clan was centered around their Ancestral Formation.<br>Reportedly, the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Formation was so vast that it practically covered the entire underground of the Li Heavenly Clan.<br>If something were to happen to it, the entire Li Heavenly Clan would be affected.<br>They were so intertwined that the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s vast amount of palaces created through the painstaking efforts of many generations might all be instantly destroyed.<br>It just so happened that something strange was happening.<br>The Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Formation was emitting a very dangerous aura. This was something that had never happened before.<br>This caused the Li Heavenly Clan to feel very worried. As such, the current Li Heavenly Clan could be said to be particularly dangerous.<br>&ldquo;Why did you mention all this to me? Are you not afraid that I will decide to not go to the Li Heavenly Clan, fearing the dangers?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Since I&rsquo;ve requested your help, I will naturally have to explain the situation to you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, little brother Chu Feng, our clan has already transferred our clansmen away. If a major problem is to truly occur to our Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Formation, our clan won't suffer many casualties. At the very most, the buildings left behind by the older generations will be destroyed, and we'll have to reconstruct new buildings.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although our clansmen care greatly about those buildings, I don't care about them at all. My only concern is my younger sister. Thus, if you're able to enter, you can disregard the situation of the spirit formation. If possible, try your hardest to rescue my little sister. Please!&rdquo;<br>Li Ruochu looked to Chu Feng with a very serious expression. A pleading expression even filled her eyes.<br>She was not asking Chu Feng, but rather pleading to him.<br>Although Chu Feng had not known Li Ruochu for long, he was able to tell that she possessed a completely different personality from her younger sister. She was someone who was fond of laughing and smiling, someone rather naughty.<br>To suddenly see her so serious, Chu Feng was rather caught off-guard.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, your little sister and I are close friends who have gone through life and death situations together. If I can enter the spirit formation, I will definitely do my utmost to save her,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;If you can save her, I will devote my life to you,&rdquo; Li Ruochu said.<br>&ldquo;Wha...?&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression took a sudden change. His chin dropped from the enormous surprise.<br>&ldquo;Haha,&rdquo; seeing the shocked Chu Feng, Li Ruochu, who originally had a very serious expression, narrowed her eyes, and then burst into loud laughter. She pointed at Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so scared. The one that&rsquo;ll be devoting her life to you will not be me, but my little sister Li Yue&rsquo;er instead.&rdquo;<br>Seeing the way she laughed, Chu Feng knew that she was joking.<br>At that moment, he felt rather helpless. Seeing the situation now, he had worried about Li Ruochu in vain.<br>This woman was a very optimistic and happy-go-lucky person. Otherwise, how could she laugh in such a joyous manner when the life and death of her younger sister was still unknown?<br>To Chu Feng&rsquo;s surprise, Li Ruochu was not finished toying with him. Seeing his helpless expression, Li Ruochu asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? I want to promise my little sister to you, yet you&rsquo;re unhappy about it?&rdquo;<br>Before Chu Feng could respond, Li Ruochu added, &ldquo;Heavens, you couldn&rsquo;t possibly be more interested in me, this older sister, than my little sister, right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;......&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt utterly helpless.<br>However...<br>Since when was Chu Feng someone that was easily toyed around with?<br>Under Li Ruochu&rsquo;s continuous attacks, Chu Feng was finally unable to keep his silence anymore. He suddenly extended his hand and raised Li Ruochu&rsquo;s chin, &ldquo;In that case, big sister, are you interested in your little brother?&rdquo;<br></p></div>
