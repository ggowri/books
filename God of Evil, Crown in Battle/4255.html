        <h1>Chapter 4254</h1>
        <div> - The Furious Tang Chen<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Even Chu Feng is unable to handle the spirit formations inside that chess board?&rdquo;<br>The crowd frowned. They felt increasingly uneasy.<br>Although they&rsquo;d chosen two people of the younger generation, Chu Feng was their sole hope.<br>Through the earlier confrontation between Chu Feng and Lu Jie, the crowd had already decided that Lu Jie was inferior to Chu Feng.<br>Although both of them carried their fates, the crowd felt that the person that would be able to save them would most likely be Chu Feng.<br>If even Chu Feng failed to breach the chess board, all of them would lose their lives.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that Chu Feng&rsquo;s nothing much either.&rdquo;<br>Compared to the frowning crowd, the corners of Lu Jie&rsquo;s lips rose into a smile.<br>Lu Jie was currently free and unaffected by the light&rsquo;s oppression. He was also unable to sense the threat to one&rsquo;s life and restriction felt by the crowd.<br>But, after learning that Chu Feng had encountered obstructions, he felt joy in his heart.<br>After all, Chu Feng was his opponent. The greater an obstruction Chu Feng encountered, the more beneficial it would be for him.<br>&ldquo;That said, I must still thank this hothead,&rdquo; Lu Jie said with a beaming smile as he looked at the red chessboard.<br>&ldquo;Woosh---&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Lu Jie finally set off and entered the other chessboard.<br>Once he stepped into the chessboard, a spirit formation wall that sealed everything off also appeared before him.<br>Two spirit formation gates then appeared on the spirit formation wall.<br>They were the same as the spirit formation gates that Chu Feng had encountered, the two spirit formation gates were red and white.<br>Lu Jie merely took a simple glance at the two spirit formation gates before making his decision. He chose to enter the white spirit formation gate.<br>Once Lu Jie entered the spirit formation gate, the chessboard he was in immediately underwent a transformation.<br>Earlier, all of the spirit formations inside the chessboard had been incomprehensible to even Grandmaster Tang Chen and the others.<br>But, once Lu Jie entered the white spirit formation gates, all of the spirit formations underwent a transformation.<br>Once they transformed, everyone was able to understand the spirit formations inside.<br>Seeing the transformation, the crowd realized the difference between the two spirit formation gates.<br>After Chu Feng had entered the red spirit formation gate, the entire chess board had ended up being dyed red.<br>No one knew what was happening to Chu Feng and the chess board he had entered.<br>But, after Lu Jie stepped into the white spirit formation gate, the chess board not only became visible, everyone within it appeared before the crowd&rsquo;s field of vision instead.<br>Most importantly, the crowd were able to clearly see the spirit formations inside.<br>&ldquo;Lu Jie, listen to me! Heed my guidance and you will definitely be able to breach this spirit formation!&rdquo; said Grandmaster Luo Tuo. He became extremely excited.<br>He felt that he was able to breach all those spirit formations inside. As long as Lu Jie complied with his guidance, he would not only be able to easily breach those spirit formations, but all their lives would be saved too.<br>But, no matter how he spoke to Lu Jie, Lu Jie did not give any response.<br>This made Grandmaster Luo Tuo realize that their voices simply could not reach Lu Jie at all.<br>Even though they were able to clearly see everything inside the chess board that Lu Jie had entered, Lu Jie didn't seem to be able to see or hear them.<br>But, to their joy, Lu Jie quickly managed to breach his first spirit formation, and rushed toward the other spirit formations.<br>Seeing that, the crowd became ecstatic.<br>After Lu Jie breached his first spirit formation, the strengthened oppression began to weaken.<br>Once Lu Jie breached his second spirit formation, the oppression weakened again.<br>Whenever Lu Jie breached a spirit formation, the oppression would weaken a bit.<br>In merely the blink of an eye, the intolerable oppression had weakened to a tolerable level.<br>What brought the crowd the greatest joy of all was the fact that breaching those spirit formations was as easy as chopping fruits and vegetables for Lu Jie. From the way things looked, even though the upcoming spirit formations would gradually become more difficult, they likely still wouldn't be able to obstruct Lu Jie.<br>As Lu Jie continued to breach formations, the oppression grew weaker and weaker. Apart from the fact that they were still unable to move, the crowd practically felt no more oppression, no more threat of death.<br>Because of this, the crowd that hadn't had much hope for Lu Jie began to have a whole new level of respect for him.<br>&ldquo;As expected of the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted&rsquo;s most talented disciple. It would appear that we will all have to depend on Lu Jie to continue surviving.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Amazing. As expected of Lu Jie, the world spiritist with the most potential in our Holy Light Galaxy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s many times more superior to that Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Fortunately, there&rsquo;s Lu Jie. With how that Chu Feng was messing around, we&rsquo;d definitely be killed by him had it not been for Lu Jie.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Fortunately, we chose Lu Jie. Else, we&rsquo;d be implicated by that Chu Feng&rsquo;s recklessness and die because of him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Humph. That Chu Feng is a useless hothead. No matter how talented someone like him might be, he&rsquo;ll still amount to nothing. He simply won&rsquo;t be able to get far. I placed my hopes in him in vain. I actually nearly harmed us by choosing him.&rdquo;<br>The crowd was praising Lu Jie nonstop.<br>At the same time, many people were cursing out Chu Feng.<br>Such was human nature.<br>They did not care how talented Chu Feng might be. After all, what could Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent possibly have to do with them?<br>But, things were different now. Their lives were all tied to Chu Feng and Lu Jie.<br>Under such special circumstances, Chu Feng had encountered a mishap in his formation breaching attempt. This was equivalent to harming them. As such, it was only natural for them to resent Chu Feng.<br>After all, if Chu Feng failed, he would end up killing them.<br>Fortunately, Lu Jie had risen to the occasion and had brought them hope<br>At that moment, Lu Jie had become their savior, and Chu Feng had become the person who had nearly killed them.<br>As such, it was only natural that they wouldn&rsquo;t hold back from cursing out Chu Feng whilst praising Lu Jie.<br>Many people even harbored ill feelings for Chu Feng.<br>Those vile individuals were not going to simply curse out Chu Feng.<br>Should the opportunity present itself in the future, they would take care of him.<br>&ldquo;Celestial Fairy Muzhi, what did you say earlier? You said something like that Chu Feng possessing exceptional talent, and he had his own understanding in how he would breach his spirit formation, that we cannot be placed on par with him?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Tell me, what is happening now then?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a mocking voice sounded. It was Grandmaster Luo Tuo.<br>Celestial Fairy Muzhi was speechless against Grandmaster Luo Tuo&rsquo;s mockery.<br>Chu Feng had nearly killed them, whereas Lu Jie had saved them. What could she possibly say in such a situation? She only had herself to blame for misjudging Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Luo Tuo, how could you say something like that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No matter what, Chu Feng is fighting for us. If we didn&rsquo;t choose him, there would simply be no need for him to brave this sort of danger.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even though his talent is exceptional, he&rsquo;s, in the end, a person of the younger generation within a hundred years of age. He&rsquo;s several hundred years younger than Lu Jie.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lu Jie has comprehended rank three Dragon Transformation Sensation, whereas Chu Feng has only comprehended rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although the spirit formations of the two chess boards are identical, they are not, by any means, fair to Chu Feng and Lu Jie.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lu Jie being able to breach those spirit formations is naturally worthy of celebration.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, even if Chu Feng fails to breach those spirit formations, he shouldn&rsquo;t be insulted like this.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, had it not been for us choosing him, there would simply have been no need for him to take this risk.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lu Jie breaching the spirit formations will mean that we will be able to survive. But, if Chu Feng fails to breach his spirit formations, he will die.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If he dies, wouldn&rsquo;t it mean that we&rsquo;re the ones that caused his death?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t we be ashamed instead?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if you lack conscience and do not feel guilt in pushing him to his death, how could you blame him?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Has your conscience been eaten by dogs?&rdquo; asked Grandmaster Tang Chen. His voice filled with anger.<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen was truly enraged. It was true, Chu Feng was fighting for them.<br>Even if he failed, the people there shouldn&rsquo;t be blaming him.<br></p></div>
