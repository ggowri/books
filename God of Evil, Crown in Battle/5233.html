        <h1>Chapter 5233</h1>
        <div>: Heavenly Bloodline<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t panic, Eggy. She&rsquo;s trying to erase our memories, but she won&rsquo;t hurt us. Just bear with it. It&rsquo;ll be over very soon.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng could sense the true nature of the energy. There was no doubt that the energy was ridiculously strong, harnessing the world spirit technique of the Ancient Era, but its only usage was to erase short-term memories.<br>&ldquo;Hm? This feeling&hellip;&rdquo;<br>However, Chu Feng quickly sensed the energy fusing together with him. It was the nine enormous lightning beasts in his dantian and his Ruler&rsquo;s Bloodline at work. Those two bloodlines were devouring the energy attempting to erase his memories, though it was apparent that the enormous lightning beasts were faster than the Ruler&rsquo;s Bloodline.<br>They were stopping Chu Feng&rsquo;s memories from being erased.<br>The woman seemed to be oblivious to this development. She thought that she had succeeded and removed her palm away from Chu Feng&rsquo;s head.<br>&ldquo;It took me the power of an entire talisman just to erase a small portion of his memories.&rdquo;<br>The woman opened up the palm she had just pressed against Chu Feng&rsquo;s head, revealing a talisman emanating the aura of the Ancient Era in it. The ridiculously powerful surge of energy that had just permeated Chu Feng and his World Spirit Space had come from this talisman.<br>This was not the first time she had used this talisman, and it would usually require just a hundredth of its power to erase a portion of a cultivator&rsquo;s memories. Yet, she had to consume an entire talisman for Chu Feng.<br>But again, how could a person who possessed the Ruler&rsquo;s Bloodline possibly be ordinary?<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s memories weren&rsquo;t erased, but the backlash from the energy left him unable to move. He should have been in an unconscious state, but his two bloodlines had devoured the energy that was supposed to erase his memories and knock him out.<br>As a result, he was still conscious of his surroundings though he was unable to move and speak.<br>However, the woman thought that Chu Feng was in an unconscious state.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame me for this. Our sect doesn&rsquo;t allow us to reveal our identities, so I can&rsquo;t allow you to remember our meeting. If a day comes where our identities can be made public, I&rsquo;ll restore your memories and compensate you,&rdquo; the woman said apologetically.<br>She brought Chu Feng back to the cavern entrance and placed him back in the same position before he entered the hidden section. Following that, she plucked out the stone on the wall.<br>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think that someone would be able to breach a treasure left behind by Lord Qin Jiu that easily,&rdquo; she murmured with a shake of her head.<br>She took out a golden metal barrier and used it to seal the cavern entrance instead. By forming a series of hand seals, the golden metal barrier transformed into the previous appearance of the cavern wall.<br>She was doing this to prevent Chu Feng from accessing the hidden section again.<br>Before re-entering the hidden section, she lightly tapped her finger on Chu Feng&rsquo;s head, infusing a gentle stream of energy into his body. It released the restraints put on his body.<br>Despite having regained his freedom, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t get up right away. He continued staring at the stone in front of him, looking as if he didn&rsquo;t remember the events that had transpired earlier. Moments later, he murmured, &ldquo;It looks like I was overthinking it. There isn&rsquo;t anything here at all.&rdquo;<br>He rose to his feet and left the area.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s act hadn&rsquo;t been in vain.<br>On the other side of the wall, the woman was staring at him. It was only after confirming that he had lost his memories that she finally turned around.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;<br>When she finally returned to the second cavern, she immediately raised her head to stare at the floating palace that was filled with all kinds of assessment pedestals. The palace was trembling, and the tremors were worsening with each passing second.<br>Eventually, a protective formation even manifested around the palace.<br>Each of the floating palaces actually had a protective formation constructed around them, just that Chu Feng was too weak to sense them. It was extremely difficult to breach these protective formations, be it from the inside or the outside.<br>After all, they were personally constructed by the strongest world spiritist in the Ancient Era, Lord Qin Jiu!<br>Yet, the floating palace looked as if it was going to crumble in spite of the protective formation.<br>With a quick examination of the floating palace, she identified the cause of the anomaly to be the Sacred Heavenly Temple&rsquo;s assessment pedestal that Chu Feng had used to assess his aptitude earlier.<br>The sword-shaped tower was only shaking ever so slightly, so that was the only thing amiss she could find inside the floating palace. It had to be the cause of this anomaly!<br>&ldquo;Could it be that&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The woman quickly rushed into the floating palace and took the sword-shaped tower out of it.<br>The moment the sword-shaped tower left the confinement of the floating palace, its trembling grew incredibly vigorous. Nine-colored light shot out from the tower itself.<br>In response, the woman quickly tossed the sword-shaped tower into the sky.<br>Weng!<br>The nine-colored light swiftly suffused the entire sky, filling up the vast space of the second cavern. A brief moment later, a ray of light shot out from the tower and melded together with the nine-colored light, eventually forming five words.<br>Heavenly Bloodline, Imperial God Tier<br>The woman widened her eyes in shock. She dared not believe what she was seeing.<br>&ldquo;Heavenly Bloodline, Imperial God Tier? What does this mean? Isn&rsquo;t the highest tier for Heavenly Bloodline &lsquo;Saint King Tier&rsquo;? I&rsquo;ve never heard of Imperial God Tier before.&rdquo;<br>Her master had once told her that all bloodlines had different levels of prowess, and it was possible to assess them through potent talent assessment pedestals.<br>Back in the Ancient Era, there was a record stating that Royal Bloodline and Imperial Bloodlines were trash. Those born with such bloodlines back in that era were lowly peasants, doomed to be trampled by others at the bottommost level.<br>Only those who possessed the Heavenly Bloodline had the potential to compete with others in the Ancient Era.<br>Nevertheless, there were still distinctions within the Heavenly Bloodline, namely Lower-tier, Middle-tier, Upper-tier, and Celestial General-tier.<br>Most inheritors of the Heavenly Bloodline were at Lower-tier. Only a small proportion of inheritors were at Middle-tier, and that was even more so for Upper-tier. Those who possessed the Upper-tier Heavenly Bloodline were qualified to become the leaders of their respective clans or sects.<br>As for Celestial General-tier, that was a level that completely transcended Upper-tier.<br>Inheritors of Celestial General-tier Heavenly Bloodline would become a powerhouse once their powers matured, and this was true even in the Ancient Era. It was the pinnacle of Heavenly Bloodlines.<br>There was once a formidable figure back in the Ancient Era who possessed a powerful bloodline that had the power to suppress all other bloodlines. It was rumored that the bloodline he possessed was no longer the Heavenly Bloodline but something far superior to it.<br>There were many attempts to gauge the true prowess of his bloodline using all kinds of aptitude assessment tools, but they were to no avail. It was impossible to capture the true potency of his bloodline.<br>However, they were still able to eventually assess that person&rsquo;s bloodline through an assessment tower dating back to the immemorial Era. It turned out that he did possess the Heavenly Bloodline too, just that his bloodline was at Saint King-tier.<br>It was then Saint King-tier became known as the highest tier for Heavenly Bloodlines.<br>In the present age, even Celestial General-tier Heavenly Bloodline was incredibly rare to find, let alone Saint King-tier Heavenly Bloodline. Yet, Chu Feng&rsquo;s bloodline was actually tested out to be a completely new tier&mdash;Imperial God-tier.<br>This was completely unheard of.<br>&ldquo;Who could have thought that it would be a completely new tier? The question to ask now is where this tier fits. Is it in between Celestial General-tier and Saint King-tier, or is it a completely unknown tier? Or could it be above Saint King-tier?<br>&ldquo;But if it&rsquo;s above Saint King-tier, why isn&rsquo;t my bloodline reacting at all? It should have been suppressed by his bloodline. Does this mean that his bloodline hasn&rsquo;t fully awakened yet? Or did someone intentionally seal it off?&rdquo; the woman pondered.<br>Tzlala!<br>Lightning began to crackle amidst the nine-colored light. That was one of the indications of a Heavenly Bloodline&mdash;Nine-colored Lightning. The only difference was that the Nine-colored Lightning was much more frightening than anything the woman had seen before, looking as if it could reduce her cavern to ruins.<br>Grar!<br>A furious roar echoed from the sky, causing the entire cavern to shake. Even the woman was forced to cover her ears.<br>Just the roar in itself made her feel as if her soul was going to shatter to bits. To think that even a cultivator of her level was unable to withstand a mere roar!<br>She hurriedly raised her head and saw the shadows of enormous lightning beasts in the sky. There were nine of them in total, and each of them spanned a size that didn&rsquo;t pale in comparison to the massive avatar looming above the Seven Realms Galaxy.<br>In fact, the majestic auras they exuded were even more frightening than the massive avatar!<br>And that was considering the fact that none of the enormous lightning beasts had fully manifested yet! If they were to appear in their full glory, they would definitely be much more intimidating.<br>Sensing that this wasn&rsquo;t just an ordinary phenomenon, the woman wanted to turn around and escape from the cavern, but she found herself unable to move at all.<br>&ldquo;Am I going to die here?&rdquo;<br>The woman felt despaired.<br>If the nine enormous lightning beasts were allowed to make a full appearance, just their auras themselves would be enough to eradicate everything in the vicinity, including her.<br>Kacha!<br>Cracks suddenly formed on the sword-shaped tower.<br>Boom!<br>The talent assessment tower from the Immemorial Era that could very well be related to the<br>Temple actually crumbled into pieces!<br>The terrifying phenomenon vanished along with the destruction of the tower, and everything reverted to normal.<br>The woman collapsed to the ground, gasping for air. Fright could be seen on her face.<br>&ldquo;Even the talent assessment tower was unable to withstand the prowess of his bloodline? How could there be someone that formidable in the present era?&rdquo;<br>Shivers ran down the woman&rsquo;s spine. She felt like she had just barely survived an ordeal.<br>If she was still uncertain a moment ago, it was clear now that the Imperial God-tier towered above the Saint King-tier. Back in the Ancient Era, that formidable figure had used this talent assessment tower to assess his bloodline, which reflected it to be Saint King-tier.<br>There were no more than three such talent assessment towers in the world, and they were incredibly precious treasures. Yet, one of them had just shattered into pieces.<br>Not to mention, it only shattered because it was unable to withstand the prowess of the Heavenly Bloodline it was assessing. Even that formidable figure hadn&rsquo;t caused such a huge commotion back then!<br>&ldquo;Hu&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The woman took in a deep breath before turning her sight outward. Her gaze pierced through the walls and fell upon Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng of the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. Were you the one who brought about God&rsquo;s Era?&rdquo; the woman murmured with a tight frown.<br></div>
