        <div> - Situation Turning Bad<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;How could this be?&rdquo;<br>Seeing this scene, not to mention the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master and the others, even the expression on Daoist Gold Star&rsquo;s face changed enormously.<br>The reason why Daoist Gold Star had been able to unleash an attack with his world spirit technique that possessed a battle power on par with rank nine Half Martial Ancestors was because he was an actual rank six Marital Ancestor.<br>Thus, even though he was only using spirit power, he was still able to unleash a battle power of a rank nine Half Martial Ancestor.<br>As for Chu Feng, his actual cultivation was only that of a mere rank four Half Martial Ancestor.<br>With his low level of cultivation, how could he possibly be able to unleash spirit power with battle power on par with rank nine Half Martial Ancestors?<br>Furthermore, he even managed to defeat Daoist Gold Star&rsquo;s attack with one strike?<br>&ldquo;Crash~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at the moment when Daoist Gold Star was astonished, a torrential rainstorm-like sound was heard from the sky above.<br>He raised his head to look, and was immediately struck dumb.<br>The sky was filled with spirit power that was densely packed together. At that moment, it was sweeping toward him.<br>It was coming at him with an aura of death.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>At the moment when the spirit power that filled the sky began to sprinkle downward, Daoist Gold Star waved his sleeve and sent forth a layer of spirit power that turned into an oval-shaped protective barrier that covered him completely.<br>&ldquo;Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang~~~&rdquo;<br>Like a torrential rain, the spirit power began to fall like a myriad of sharp blades.<br>However, the world spirit barrier created by Daoist Gold Star acted like an indestructible fort.<br>Even though Chu Feng&rsquo;s attack was extremely powerful, and caused energy ripples to fly about in all directions, it was unable to break through the fort created by Daoist Gold Star.<br>&ldquo;Huu~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, the indestructible fort suddenly disappeared.<br>Merely, when Daoist Gold Star&rsquo;s figure reappeared again, a watermelon-sized spheroid was in his hand.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Daoist Gold Star tossed the sphere upward. As the sphere spun, it let out a boundless amount of attractive power.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power was rapidly absorbed by that sphere.<br>As more and more spirit power was absorbed by the sphere, the sphere actually started to emit waves of oppressive might that caused ripples to appear in space itself.<br>When the spirit power Chu Feng had unleashed was absorbed completely, the ripples created by the waves of oppressive might became so intense that they were frightening.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a spirit formation,&rdquo; Upon seeing the strange sphere of light, the eyes of the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master and the others shone brightly.<br>They finally realized why Daoist Gold Star had only blocked Chu Feng&rsquo;s attack with his defensive barrier earlier. It turned out that he had been setting up a spirit formation.<br>&ldquo;Not bad, not bad. You were actually able to block my first attack. You&rsquo;re pretty decent.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, the next attack will completely destroy you.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Daoist Gold Star tossed the sphere out again.<br>Once the sphere was tossed, a ray of light that contained enormous power began to surge toward Chu Feng.<br>Most importantly, that sphere itself possessed an extremely powerful might.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng did not dare to underestimate the sphere, and began to unleash spirit power to attack the sphere nonstop. He wanted to stop the sphere.<br>However, the sphere was unstoppable. All of the spirit power Chu Feng had shot toward it was absorbed.<br>Soon, the sphere was about to reach Chu Feng. However, Chu Feng was unable to stop it.<br>&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo;<br>Seeing that scene, the crowd were once again extremely worried for Chu Feng.<br>This match was a match of world spirit techniques. As such, one could not use martial power.<br>With how powerful that sphere was, Chu Feng might be able to dodge it should he utilize his martial power to unleash a movement type Taboo Martial Skill.<br>However, he could not use martial skills right now. As such, how was he to dodge it?<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at the moment when the crowd were worried, Chu Feng turned into a ray of light and dodged the incoming sphere.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you actually used a martial skill? You have lost this match. Go and kill yourself immediately. Do not force me to personally kill you,&rdquo; Daoist Gold Star shouted loudly. His voice was filled with complacence.<br>After all, the two of them had only just started fighting, yet he was already able to force Chu Feng to use a martial skill. This completely demonstrated how powerful he was. As such, he would naturally be pleased.<br>&ldquo;Foolish dog, look carefully. Am I using a spirit formation or a martial skill here?&rdquo; Chu Feng said mockingly.<br>&ldquo;This?!!!&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the crowd all began to carefully inspect Chu Feng. Upon closer inspection, the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master and the others were immediately overjoyed, whereas Daoist Gold Star revealed a gloomy expression.<br>The reason why Chu Feng&rsquo;s speed was so fast right now was because there was a body of light underneath his feet. That body of light was as fast as lightning. That was how Chu Feng had obtained his lightning fast speed.<br>However, that body of light was not a martial skill. The reason for that was because it did not contain the slightest bit of martial power. Instead, it contained pure spirit power.<br>Thus, it was not a martial skill, but instead a world spirit formation.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng is truly amazing. He has actually grasped such a powerful spirit formation. That speed is simply even faster than Taboo Martial Skills,&rdquo; The Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master, Su Jingrui and the others were all overjoyed.<br>Even the Three Star Hall&rsquo;s headmaster began to applaud Chu Feng. After all, he had already had a falling out with Daoist Gold Star, and thus wanted Chu Feng to win.<br>However, in terms of being happy, the person that was the happiest right now was none other than Xu Yiyi. Even though she was clearly standing in the air, she was still jumping and hopping in joy. Not only that, she was also cheering for Chu Feng, and even shouted at Daoist Gold Star, &ldquo;Hey! Daoist Gold Star! You are an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, how could you not tell the difference between spirit power and martial power? Could it be that your vision has been blurred by your old age?&rdquo;<br>Although everyone was feeling happy for Chu Feng, there was one exception. In fact, that person&rsquo;s expression was equally as ugly as Daoist Gold Star&rsquo;s expression. That person was none other than Kou Kang.<br>Who was Kou Kang? He was someone who liked Xu Yiyi, and viewed Chu Feng as his rival in love.<br>It would be one thing for Chu Feng to be in the limelight right now. However, his beloved was actually even cheering for Chu Feng in a love-struck manner.<br>In fact, even his junior sister Song Biyu had a reaction similar to Xu Yiyi&rsquo;s. This caused Kou Kang to truly feel stifled.<br>&ldquo;Even if that is the case, you will still undoubtedly be defeated.&rdquo;<br>After that, Daoist Gold Star grew even more furious. He began to form hand seals with one hand, and that spirit formation sphere actually started to turn again. Once again, it started to chase after Chu Feng.<br>Furthermore, this time around, its speed was even faster, and its power was even mightier.<br>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo;<br>With the golden sphere coming toward him, Chu Feng started to frown. He did not dare to be careless in the slightest. He began to utilize the spirit formation underneath his feet to wholeheartedly escape.<br>Chu Feng was shocked to discover that the speed of that sphere was truly too fast. He was no longer able to stop anywhere, and had to run away nonstop.<br>Else, he would be caught by the sphere. Once he was caught, Chu Feng knew that he would be met with a disastrous fate.<br>The reason for that was because the sphere was very strong. Furthermore, it was very strange. It seemed to possess the effect of being an antithesis to spirit power. That sphere was no ordinary spirit formation.<br>Chu Feng felt that it would absolutely be impossible for him to block it should he not use martial power to unleash a taboo martial skill. If the situation was bad, he might even end up being crushed to death by the sphere.<br>&ldquo;Humph. You dared insult me as a foolish dog? What are you now? Are you not a running dog fleeing in panic?&rdquo;<br>Seeing that Chu Feng was fleeing nonstop without even bothering to turn his head around, Daoist Gold Star started to mock him.<br>&ldquo;What do we do? Master, will Chu Feng be able to turn the situation around?&rdquo;<br>Seeing that Chu Feng had entered a disadvantageous situation, Xu Yiyi became extremely worried. She looked to her master Su Jingrui.<br>Faced with this, Su Jingrui started to frown deeply.<br>He then said, &ldquo;Although Daoist Gold Star is only an Insect Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, he remains someone who has meticulously studied world spirit techniques for thousands of years.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although that spirit formation sphere might appear to be simple, it is extremely difficult to deal with. Right now, Chu Feng is only able to dodge that spirit formation, and simply does not have the time to set up a spirit formation to counterattack.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If this is to continue, I fear that the situation will be far from good.&rdquo;<br><br></p></div>
