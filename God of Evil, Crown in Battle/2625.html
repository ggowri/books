        <div> - Astonishingly Beautiful<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Chu Feng did not know that the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster had fled. At that moment, all of Chu Feng&rsquo;s focus was on fighting against the Evil God Sword.<br>He discovered that the power of the Evil God Sword had grown stronger and stronger. Even though he had clearly only used the Evil God Sword for a very short period of time at that moment, the power of the Evil God Sword was very fierce, and much stronger than before.<br>It was so strong that Chu Feng found it very difficult to break free from it.<br>&ldquo;Wuu~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng felt an acute pain from his right arm that he held the Evil God Sword with.<br>The next moment, the attack the Evil God Sword was unleashing against him also started to decline.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s consciousness began to return. When he opened his eyes, he discovered a beautiful woman standing before him.<br>It was a young girl with a petite build. However, her proportions were superb.<br>As for that young woman&rsquo;s face, it was awfully beautiful. Her large eyes were extremely enchanting.<br>Merely, she gave off an ice-cold air. That ice-coldness she emitted was not a disguise. Rather, it originated from deep within her.<br>Fortunately, she was wearing a long yellow skirt. Although that skirt was not very dazzling, it gave her a sort of brightness that complemented her coldness, making her seem less cold and detached.<br>Coincidentally, right when Chu Feng cast his gaze toward the young girl, a burst of wind just so happened to blow past. It lifted up the girl&rsquo;s long skirt and revealed her fair and beautiful legs.<br>With those legs, the beauty of the young girl was immediately increased to the extreme.<br>Beautiful. She was most definitely a rarely seen beauty.<br>Chu Feng had been in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm for some time now. He had also seen many beauties.<br>However, this beauty was definitely the most stunning beauty Chu Feng had ever laid his eyes on.<br>That said, Chu Feng actually knew that beauty. Merely, Chu Feng was still astonished upon seeing her. He was deeply charmed by her beauty.<br>The reason for that was because that young girl was Li Yue&rsquo;er.<br>Li Yue&rsquo;er who had always dressed up in male outfits was actually wearing a typical female outfit. In a female outfit, she was truly stunning.<br>Even someone like Chu Feng who had seen countless beauties before was deeply attracted by her beauty.<br>Perhaps it was because Chu Feng had accidentally touched that area when Li Yue&rsquo;er was wearing a male outfit, but Chu Feng started to involuntarily cast his gaze toward that area.<br>At that moment, he discovered that her development in that area was truly quite ample. It was no wonder that the sensation felt that good.<br>As Chu Feng began to survey Li Yue&rsquo;er up and down with his gaze, Li Yue&rsquo;er&rsquo;s face turned red like an apple. Then, she glared fiercely at Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Continue looking, if you are to continue looking, you&rsquo;re going to bleed to death.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; Chu Feng only realized the pain in his right arm after hearing what Li Yue&rsquo;er said. He looked over and discovered that his right arm had actually been severed. His severed arm was on the ground.<br>However, even with that being the case, that severed arm was still tightly holding onto the Evil God Sword.<br>&ldquo;Why are you so fierce after all this time? We have only just met, yet you&rsquo;ve already decided to chop off my hand again?&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t chop of your arm, would you be able to break free from that Demon Armament?&rdquo; Li Yue&rsquo;er asked.<br>&ldquo;Hehe, I knew that you were doing it for my sake. Thanks girl,&rdquo; Chu Feng laughed mischievously.<br>How could he not know that Li Yue&rsquo;er had hacked off his arm for his sake?<br>Earlier, Chu Feng&rsquo;s entire body was not under his control. If it wasn&rsquo;t for Li Yue&rsquo;er severing his arm, he might really not have been able to break free from the Evil God Sword&rsquo;s evil clutches.<br>As Chu Feng expressed his thanks, he extended his hand toward his severed arm on the ground. Even though he was over ten thousand meters in the air, his severed arm was instantly sucked into his grasp.<br>After the severed arm entered his hand, Chu Feng removed the Evil God Sword from it. Then, he placed his severed arm onto his severed wound.<br>With merely a thought, his spirit power surged forth. Not only did he manage to suture his arm without a single scar, but even his severed clothes were restored with his arm.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still planning to keep that sword?&rdquo; Seeing that Chu Feng had put the Evil God Sword away, Li Yue&rsquo;er narrowed her eyebrows slightly.<br>&ldquo;Although it is a bit dangerous, it remains to be a method to save myself. For example, it saved me this time around,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Is it really only a bit dangerous?&rdquo;<br>Li Yue&rsquo;er started to frown. She had witnessed the scene earlier in its entirety.<br>Even now, she felt lingering fear as she recalled the crimson clouds that had covered the sky and the demonic aura that had enveloped the earth.<br>That was truly a power capable of utter devastation.<br>&ldquo;You should find a place to seal that sword. That sword is too strange. It is most definitely not an ordinary Demon Armament,&rdquo; Li Yue&rsquo;er said.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart moved upon hearing what Li Yue&rsquo;er said. Li Yue&rsquo;er should possess an extraordinary origin. She knew much more than the people from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>When even she gave the Evil God Sword such an evaluation, it verified to Chu Feng that the Evil God Sword was extremely remarkable.<br>That was understandable too. After all, the Evil God Sword was a weapon that not even his father could see through.<br>&ldquo;I know what to do,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>Even though he knew that the Evil God Sword was very dangerous, he still decided to continue to carry it with him.<br>&ldquo;Do as you wish,&rdquo; Seeing that Chu Feng was insistent on keeping the Evil God Sword, Li Yue&rsquo;er no longer tried to urge him against it.<br>However, she still cast a glance at Chu Feng. It was a cold and detached glance. It was as if she was stating to him &lsquo;your life and death is none of my concern.&rsquo;<br>&ldquo;Why would you appear here? You couldn&rsquo;t possibly have been worried about me, right?&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.<br>After hearing what Chu Feng said, Li Yue&rsquo;er cast a cold side-eye at Chu Feng. She said, &ldquo;I have come to enjoy the liveliness. It is pure coincidence that I ran into you all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I expected,&rdquo; Chu Feng was not surprised by that answer. How could someone with Li Yue&rsquo;er&rsquo;s personality go out of her way to deliberately come find him?<br>Moreover, Li Yue&rsquo;er should not know that he was there.<br>&ldquo;I am leaving. I figured I might as well bid you farewell before leaving,&rdquo; Li Yue&rsquo;er said.<br>What Li Yue&rsquo;er said next completely shifted the topic around. She originally said that she did not come to deliberately find Chu Feng.<br>However, what she now said was clearly indicating that she actually had deliberately come to find Chu Feng.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng sighed. That girl Li Yue&rsquo;er was truly amusing.<br>However, Chu Feng was also feeling a bit glad. This ice-cold and detached girl had decided to deliberately made the trip to bid him farewell. This meant that she must consider him to be her friend.<br>&ldquo;Where are you going? Are you returning home?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked. He had long since known that Li Yue&rsquo;er was definitely not someone from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. A girl as talented as her was most definitely from the Upper Realms.<br>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not returning home. Merely, I&rsquo;ll be changing my training place,&rdquo; Li Yue&rsquo;er said.<br>&ldquo;Where to?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;The Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm,&rdquo; Li Yue&rsquo;er said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, we might meet again in the future,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a slight smile.<br>&ldquo;Although this place is under the control of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm and the teleportation formations here also lead to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, if you do not wish to go to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, I can help bring you to the Upper Realm that you want to go to,&rdquo; Li Yue&rsquo;er said.<br>&ldquo;You truly have a lot of abilities. However, there&rsquo;s no need for that. After all, the place that I want to go the most is the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Wuu~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly frowned. His previously smiling face was immediately replaced with an expression of pain.<br>In an instant, Chu Feng&rsquo;s face turned paper pale. He was also clenching his fists tightly.<br>Upon closer inspection, Li Yue&rsquo;er could see that Chu Feng&rsquo;s entire body was shaking. He was trembling in pain.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Li Yue&rsquo;er immediately lent an arm to support Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Demon Armament&rsquo;s backlash,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with great difficulty.<br><br></p></div>
