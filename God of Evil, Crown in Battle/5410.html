        <h1>Chapter 5410</h1>
        <div><span>: A Giveaway Trial</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>Devoured by the red aura, Chu Feng felt like he had fallen into the ocean.</span><br><span>Now that he was looking at the red aura up close, it looked more beautiful than it was terrifying, but even so, he understood just how destructive this thing was. It gave him a clear sense of how insignificant he was and that he still had a long way to go in his path of cultivation.</span><br><span>The master of the red aura was so much stronger than him that he couldn&rsquo;t even begin to see the other party&rsquo;s limits.</span><br><span>The powerful red aura rushed at Chu Feng, but surprisingly, he remained unscathed at their assault. Even his clothes weren&rsquo;t nicked in the least. However, a strained look had appeared on his face.</span><br><span>As it turned out, the red aura targeted not the physical body but the soul!</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is this imperial might?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng initially felt light-headed, but through his sheer willpower, he was able to quickly adapt and recollect himself. As long as the power of the imperial might didn&rsquo;t increase, he should be able to hold his ground. Thus, he endured the imperial might and continued advancing.</span><br><span>But as time passed, his footsteps visibly grew heavier. While he managed to maintain a clear mind, his body had started to reach its limits. Exhaustion was slowly getting the better of him, resulting in his footsteps becoming increasingly sluggish.</span><br><span>Panic slowly got the better of him. He knew that he would eventually succumb at this rate.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You are qualified to advance to the next stage.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Just then, the feminine voice that echoed throughout the entire spatial realm like a deity resounded once more.</span><br><span>The surrounding red aura receded, and Chu Feng found that he was no longer inside the boundless spatial realm but floating above a hall.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Elder, thank you for sparing me.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng bowed in gratitude to the other party even though the red aura had already vanished. He knew that he had only survived because the other party had gone easy on him. That so-called imperial might wasn&rsquo;t the other party&rsquo;s true strength at all, or else there was no way he would have been able to withstand it.</span><br><span>There was no response from the feminine voice, but Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t too bothered by it. He wasn&rsquo;t so naive as to think that he could win over the master of the remnant through courtesy. Ultimately, he still had to prove his own capabilities by clearing the subsequent trials.</span><br><span>Thus, Chu Feng popped a pill into his mouth before descending into the hall beneath. He knew that he had to quickly recover his strength since the trials would only get progressively harder.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>With a tremble, two hidden walls suddenly appeared in the walls, one in front and one behind. The hidden door behind contained a spirit formation gate with the word &lsquo;Retreat&rsquo; on it, whereas the hidden door in front led into a dark passageway.</span><br><span>A red aura suffused the dark passageway. It looked similar to the red aura inside the boundless spatial realm, but it didn&rsquo;t feel as terrifying. Yet, this red aura carried an overwhelming scent of blood, hinting that this trial wasn&rsquo;t as easy as it seemed.</span><br><span>Weng!</span><br><span>Just then, a surge of transportation energy manifested beside Chu Feng.</span><br><span>It was the young man whom he had met earlier, but he looked to be in a terrible state. His face was pale, and his eyes looked empty. By this point, he was already more of a corpse than a living being.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is it the result of the imperial might? Did he choose to challenge it too?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng walked up to the young man and grabbed his wrist. Through feeling the young man&rsquo;s pulse, he realized that the young man was in a precarious condition, such that he could lose his life if he wasn&rsquo;t treated right away.</span><br><span>Chu Feng wanted to help the young man, but there was not much he could do with his spirit power sealed. He could feed the young man his pills, but these pills wouldn&rsquo;t be of much help.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You wish to save him?&rdquo; the powerful feminine voice echoed in the hall.</span><br><span>Those words informed Chu Feng that the feminine voice wasn&rsquo;t produced by a formation; it was likely from a real sentient being. The master of this remnant could very well still be alive.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Elder, I wish to help him but I don&rsquo;t have the means to.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Even if Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation hadn&rsquo;t been sealed, it would still be difficult for him to save the young man with his current level of spirit power.</span><br><span>Weng!</span><br><span>A red spirit formation gate manifested in front of Chu Feng. It looked menacing.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Step in and undergo the trial if you wish to save him,&rdquo; the feminine voice said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go, Chu Feng! You don&rsquo;t need to risk your life for a stranger!&rdquo; Eggy advised.</span><br><span>Even a fool could tell that the red spirit formation gate was filled with danger.</span><br><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing nobler in the world than saving a life. Thank you for granting me this opportunity.&rdquo; Chu Feng rose to his feet and walked toward the red spirit formation gate.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re out of your mind! I disallow it! Come back!&rdquo; Eggy roared.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Calm down, Eggy. This is a giveaway question,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Eggy was perplexed. Before she could grasp what was going on, Chu Feng had already stepped into the red spirit formation gate, which transported him back into the same hall.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Your courage is praiseworthy. He owes you a favor now,&rdquo; the powerful feminine voice echoed.</span><br><span>A surge of red aura flowed toward the young man, and his condition began to improve.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Eggy was confused.</span><br><span>&ldquo;While that red formation gate looked dangerous, I had a feeling that it was just for show. Even if there was a trial, it was unlikely to be anything too dangerous,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is that so? Well, that might be the case, but why do I have a feeling that you&rsquo;re indirectly saying that I&rsquo;m dumb?&rdquo; Eggy frowned.</span><span> </span></p></div>
