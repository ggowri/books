        <div> - Ashamed Gazes<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;What did you just say?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; have you gone mad?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Who did you think you are? Do you really think you can reach a breakthrough just because you want to?&rdquo;<br>Chu Haoyan immediately opened his mouth wide with shock upon hearing those words. He had simply never expected Chu Feng to say that sort of thing.<br>The others present were also very startled by Chu Feng&rsquo;s declaration. The experts from the older generation even began to shake their heads in disappointment.<br>No one had ever made such a boastful claim in the entire Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>In a nutshell, the great majority of people felt that Chu Feng was boasting too excessively.<br>However, faced with the crowd&rsquo;s questioning gazes, Chu Feng merely smiled, and then sat down in a cross-legged manner with his eyes closed.<br>&ldquo;What is Chu Feng trying to do? Could he really be planning to attempt a breakthrough?&rdquo;<br>Both the experts of the older generation and the geniuses from the younger generation were completely baffled by Chu Feng&rsquo;s actions. They did not know what Chu Feng was trying to do.<br>Soon, a special ripple emerged from Chu Feng&rsquo;s body. That ripple caused the crowd&rsquo;s eyes to brighten. As Chu Heavenly Clansmen, they knew what Chu Feng was doing.<br>Chu Feng was really attempting to make a breakthrough.<br>At that moment, a lackey standing beside Chu Haoyan began to mock Chu Feng. Seemingly trying to influence the crowd&rsquo;s state of mind, he said very loudly, &ldquo;Haha, little brother Haoyan, what you&rsquo;ve said is correct. That Chu Feng has truly gone insane. He&rsquo;s actually really attempting to make a breakthrough. Who does he think he is ? Does he really think he can make a breakthrough just because he declared he would?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Humph, an ignorant fool. Regardless of how talented he might be, he will not be able to reach greatness in the end,&rdquo; Chu Haoyan mocked.<br>&ldquo;What little brother Haoyan says is extremely correct,&rdquo; once Chu Haoyan made such a declaration, his lackeys standing behind him all echoed in agreement.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right at that moment, rumbles sounded from high above in the sky.<br>The crowd turned their heads up to look, and were all stunned.<br>High up in the sky, nine-colored lightning was spiraling around like massive dragons.<br>Even though the lightning was very high up in the sky, its ear-piercing rumbles were very clear. It was as if it was within one&rsquo;s reach.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the lightning condensed together and formed a nine-colored pillar of lightning that struck down from the sky, landing on Chu Feng.<br>At that moment, it was not only Chu Haoyan and his lackeys that were stunned. Even Chu Yue, Chu Huai, Chu Ruoshi, Chu Lingxi, Chu Huanyu and the other Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations were all stunned.<br>In fact, even Chu Xuanzhengfa, Lord Youyuan and Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather had expressions of disbelief on their faces.<br>Simply no one had expected Chu Feng to be able to immediately call forth Divine Tribulation lightning right after sitting down. He actually really made a breakthrough.<br>No, he had still not yet made a breakthrough. At the very least, he had yet to succeed.<br>As everyone knew, obtaining sufficient comprehension to make a breakthrough was only a portion of making a breakthrough for those trained in Self-Punishment Mysterious Techniques. Most crucial of all would be whether or not they would be able to successfully withstand the Self-Punishment Mysterious Technique&rsquo;s tribulation lightning.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s Divine Tribulation lightning had already struck down at him. The lightning was roaring like giant dragons. It wanted to tear Chu Feng&rsquo;s body to pieces.<br>Seeing the intensely powerful tribulation lightning, even the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s older generations began to move back out of fear of being implicated by the lightning, and meeting a miserable death in the process.<br>Even though they all knew that the Self-Punishment Mysterious Technique&rsquo;s tribulation lightning would only attack the person who had drawn it, they had never before witnessed a tribulation lightning so powerful.<br>It was simply too frightening. It was so imposing that it resembled the descent of a calamity. No one would be able to keep themselves from becoming somewhat panicked.<br>&ldquo;So frightening! Is that what the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique is like? Will Chu Feng really be able to withstand such powerful tribulation lightning?&rdquo;<br>Seeing this tribulation lightning, some people started to worry for Chu Feng. They felt that it was simply impossible for anyone to withstand such powerful tribulation lightning.<br>Right at that moment, the Divine Tribulation&rsquo;s lightning started to dissipate. The crowd were also able to clearly sense that Chu Feng&rsquo;s aura was changing.<br>He was no longer a rank five True Immortal. Instead, he had become a rank six True Immortal.<br>Chu Feng had successfully made a breakthrough.<br>&ldquo;Heavens, he actually really managed to make his breakthrough!!!&rdquo;<br>The crowd were endlessly astonished. That said, the emotions in their hearts were even more complicated than the expressions on their faces.<br>Even Chu Ruoshi, Chu Lingxi and the two men who greatly detested Chu Feng, Chu Huanyu and Chu Haoyan, were stunned.<br>The great majority of the people present were astonished. Only Chu Xuanzhengfa had a smile on his face. He took a glance at Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather and several of the other elders present.<br>All the people that sensed Chu Xuanzhengfa&rsquo;s gaze revealed an ashamed and displeased expression, replacing their astonishment.<br>Back then, Chu Feng was deemed as someone incapable of cultivating. Because of that, he was deemed trash and exiled from the Chu Heavenly Clan together with his father, Chu Xuanyuan.<br>They had all definitely taken part in that.<br>However, the trash that they&rsquo;d deemed to be incapable of cultivating had returned to their Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Furthermore, he had caused all of the most talented geniuses in their Chu Heavenly Clan to pale by comparison.<br>With this, how could they not be ashamed?<br>In the moment when the crowd was astonished, Chu Feng awakened the second Flame Extinguishment Pearl in his hand and handed it back to Chu Yue.<br>&ldquo;Little brother Chu Feng, I truly do not know how to thank you,&rdquo; holding the awakened Flame Extinguishing Pearl, Chu Yue was so excited that her body started to tremble.<br>Chu Feng smiled lightly. He said, &ldquo;You are my big sis, there&rsquo;s no need to act so courteous toward me. However&hellip; I&rsquo;m afraid that I will end up offending certain people by awakening this Flame Extinguishing Pearl. After all, as long as big sis Chu Yue enters the Nine Moons Sacred Domain, a certain someone will end up losing his qualifications to enter the Nine Moons Sacred Domain,&rdquo; after saying those words, Chu Feng looked to Chu Haoyan.<br>Seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s provocative gaze, Chu Haoyan was so furious that his face started twitching.<br>&ldquo;I am willing to give my Flame Extinguishing Pearl to Chu Haoyan,&rdquo; right at that moment, someone stood out from the crowd. With a Flame Extinguishing Pearl in hand, that person walked over to Chu Haoyan.<br>As for Chu Haoyan, he accepted that Flame Extinguishing Pearl from that person without saying a single word of thanks. It was as if it were only natural for him to be presented with a Flame Extinguishing Pearl.<br>That said, it was indeed natural. After all, that person was his lackey, his subordinate. How could he thank his own subordinate, someone he looked down on from the bottom of his heart?<br><br><br></p></div>
