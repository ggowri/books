        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo; Chu Feng suddenly sensed a gaze assessing him from the crowd, but the gaze vanished as soon as he tried looking for it. &ldquo;There are experts hidden amongst us.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried searching around for the owner of the gaze, but it was to no avail. He suspected that the owner of the gaze recognized him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Congratulations, Brother Chu Feng.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re amazing to have reached Gold Dragon God-cloak at such a young age. You were even in first place for the trial!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of people gathered around Chu Feng to congratulate him. These were the people who had been on the same trial as him, and they had witnessed what happened </span><span>earlier. They thought that Chu Feng had powerful backing as well, so they rushed over to congratulate him in hopes of forging good ties with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Chu Feng waved his sleeves and disappeared into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;He disappeared?&rdquo; The crowd was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng had employed a concealment formation. He didn&rsquo;t want to waste his time entertaining those fence-sitters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chen Hui disappeared?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng tried scanning the vicinity but he couldn&rsquo;t sense Chen Hui&rsquo;s aura. This worried him. While there weren&rsquo;t any deep ties between them, he thought that Chen Hui was a good person. There was no need for Chen Hui to offend the Immortal Spirit Manor&rsquo;s Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span>, but the latter still did it for his sake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t leave Chen Hui to the lurch. Sensing that something was amiss about Chen Hui&rsquo;s appearance, he tried searching for Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> and Song Yuping instead. The two of them were sneaking out of the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those two had been Chen Hui&rsquo;s and his greatest enemy thus far, so he decided to follow the two of them to see if they had a hand in Chen Hui&rsquo;s disappearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though this should have been a foreign land to them, the two of them still flitted forward with a clear destination in mind, as if they had been here before. Neither of them </span><span>spoke</span><span> a word along the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only after they were a safe distance away from the crowd that Song Yuping finally asked, &ldquo;Senior, what&rsquo;s Chu Feng&rsquo;s background? Why did those two Saint-tier elders stand up for him? Did we offend someone we shouldn&rsquo;t have?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was feeling intimidated now that she knew Chu Feng was not a pushover, and she was scared of his vengeance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pah!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> slapped Song Yuping&rsquo;s face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;How am I to know the answer to that question? It&rsquo;s your fault for coming up with the lousy idea of bribing the managerial elder. My father will punish me harshly if he ever learns about this.&rdquo; Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;er</span><span> vented his anger on Song Yuping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Senior, I didn&rsquo;t think that it would turn out like this.&rdquo; Song Yuping felt so indignant that she burst into tears once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their attitudes made Chu Feng realize that neither of them had the guts to exact vengeance on him. This meant that they were unlikely to have anything to do with Chen Hui&rsquo;s disappearance. Thus, he turned around and returned in the direction he had come from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> and Song Yuping continued heading off. </span><span>Some time</span><span> later, they suddenly halted their footsteps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An unexpected person was standing in their path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> and Song Yuping were taken aback. They first scanned their surroundings to confirm that there was no one else in the vicinity before turning their attention back to the person standing before them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chen Hui, how dare you appear before me?&rdquo; Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> asked coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I appear before you? Do you think I&rsquo;d be afraid of two eliminated </span><span>trash</span><span>?&rdquo; Chen Hui scoffed mockingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think that I dare not touch you just because you have Chu Feng&rsquo;s backing? I&rsquo;m only holding back because I wish to avoid trouble. I suggest you disappear from my sight before I lose my temper, or else don&rsquo;t blame me for not showing you any mercy!&rdquo; Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Oh? I&rsquo;d like to see how you intend not to show me any mercy.&rdquo; Chen Hui wasn&rsquo;t intimidated by Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao&rsquo;s</span><span> threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those words piqued Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao&rsquo;s</span><span> vigilance. He warily scanned his surroundings as he asked, &ldquo;You must have brought a helper here. It looks like you really want to settle things between us?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chen Hui didn&rsquo;t respond to that remark. He simply looked at Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> with a contemptuous smile, which further angered the latter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You must be a fool to dare provoke me when I&rsquo;m already in a bad mood. Do you think that you can challenge me just because you have a helper? Why do you think I headed in this direction in the first place?&rdquo; Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> said as he crushed a talisman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A unique aura dissipated into the surroundings. Within moments, hundreds of </span><span>world</span><span> spiritists quickly flew over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Paying respects to the young master!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all from the Immortal Spirit Manor. Most of them were pinnacle God-cloak World Spiritists, and the strongest amongst them was a True Dragon World Spiritist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What happened, </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span>? Who is he?&rdquo; the True Dragon World Spiritist asked Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s trash, but he thinks that he can mess with me,&rdquo; Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of the experts from the Immortal Spirit Manor looked at Chen Hui with murderous eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Chen Hui remained fearless. He continued looking at Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> with the same contemptuous smile as he asked, &ldquo;Then do you know why I showed myself here? It&rsquo;s because I knew that your people are waiting for you in the vicinity.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What big words. Take him down!&rdquo; the True Dragon World Spiritist ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of the experts from the Immortal Spirit Manor simultaneously rushed at Chen Hui.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surrounding space shook. and a powerful surge of martial power rippled outward. All of the pinnacle God-cloak World Spiritists who came into contact with it instantaneously disintegrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst the distorted space, a person appeared. He was over ten meters in height, looking like a hill next to Chen Hui. He was dressed in a white veil bamboo hat, a red robe, and a white cloak. Written in black on the white cloak were the words &lsquo;Netherworld General&rsquo;.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Netherworld Sect?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The True Dragon World Spiritist from the Immortal Spirit Manor was stunned. He immediately grabbed Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> and Song Yuping in an attempt to flee together with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uwa</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could make a move, the True Dragon World Spiritist suddenly groaned in pain. The Netherworld General had flitted behind him and grabbed him by his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Netherworld General exerted a powerful suction force from his palm that pulled the True Dragon World Spiritist into his hand. It was appalling how a True Dragon World Spiritist was completely helpless before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Song Yuping was shocked beyond words. Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> trembled with fear as he asked Chen Hui, &ldquo;Y-you&hellip; are from the Netherworld Sect?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not waste our time. Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span>, I can give you a chance. If you defeat me in a fight, I&rsquo;ll spare the two of you,&rdquo; Chen Hui said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;B-brother Chen Hui, it&rsquo;s all a misunderstanding. There&rsquo;s no major grudge between us. There&rsquo;s no need for us to go this far.&rdquo; Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> didn&rsquo;t dare to make a move on Chen Hui and instead begged for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chen Hui was unmoved. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll count to three. I&rsquo;ll take your lives if you don&rsquo;t make your move.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao&rsquo;s</span><span> complexion turned awful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;3.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;2.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chen Hui began counting down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao&rsquo;s</span><span> expression finally warped in savagery. He unleashed his prowess as a Gold Dragon God-cloak and charged at Chen Hui. He dared not to kill Chen Hui, and he didn&rsquo;t think that the latter would really spare him either. His true intention was to hold Chen Hui hostage and threaten the Netherworld General into letting him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Much to his surprise, Chen Hui easily dodged his attack with a sidestep. The next moment, he suddenly froze in place. He slowly lowered his head and saw that Chen Hui had plunged a formation dagger into his </span><span>dantian</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The formation dagger emanated energy comparable to a rank seven Half-God level cultivator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Y-you&rsquo;re an Immortal Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist?&rdquo; Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> stared at Chen Hui in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chen Hui simply smiled at Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span>, not bothering to answer the question. He raised his arm and easily sliced Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> into two. Then, he smiled at Song Yuping and said, &ldquo;You ought to accompany your senior on his journey too.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Song Yuping immediately kneeled down and cried, &ldquo;Young master Chen Hui, I know my folly now. Please spare me. I&rsquo;m willing to slave off for you as long as you give me a chance.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chen Hui smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flick of his wrist, he tossed the formation dagger out. The dagger flew across the air in a streak of light and pierced through Song Yuping&rsquo;s neck, reaping her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the Netherworld General watched the scene without saying a word. Once they were done, he raised his palm to exert his suction force in order to clean the field. However, Chen Hui waved his hand and stopped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for that.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Netherworld General stopped what he was doing, but he asked Chen Hui in confusion, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Keep these for little sister </span><span>Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s</span><span> sweetheart. We should hike up the difficulty for him,&rdquo; Chen Hui replied with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still looked as honest and naive as before, but </span><span>somehow</span><span> he gave off an aura of danger.</span></p></div>
