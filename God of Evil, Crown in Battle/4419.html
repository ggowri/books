        <div>: An Important Affair<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Based on the intelligence the Dragon Clan had gathered thus far, the other six Godwish Pearls were distributed across the Yu Heavenly Clan, the Monstrous Herd Temple, and the Cloudsky Immortal Sect.<br>Chu Feng had heard of those three powers before.<br>The Yu Heavenly Clan and the Monstrous Herd Temple were renowned powers whose names were spoken alongside the Dragon Clan. Similar to the Dragon Clan, they were second only to the Holy Light Clan within the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>As for the Cloudsky Immortal Sect, even though it had only begun making a name for itself in recent times, its strength was not to be underestimated. There was a good chance that it wielded strength on par with the Dragon Clan too.<br>&ldquo;Little benefactor, come along with me. This is a hard-to-come-by opportunity!&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao said once more.<br>Her beady eyes were filled with expectations, but at the same time, there was a hint of unease in it too. She was afraid that Chu Feng would reject her.<br>Chu Feng was indeed moved after hearing Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s story, but he still had some hesitation.<br>It was at this moment that a voice transmission arrived into Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears. It was from the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you should go to the Godwish Palace. This is indeed a rare opportunity. Based on what I know, the Godwish Grandmother would usually scatter her Godwish Pearls within the Nine Souls Galaxy and bestow the fortuitous encounters on the younger generation of the Nine Souls Galaxy. This is the first time that she&rsquo;s scattering her pearls within the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>&ldquo;Typically speaking, if the Holy Light Clan were to make a move, it would be impossible for the Dragon Clan and the other powers to obtain the Godwish Pearls. However, due to the conflict between the Godwish Grandmother and the Holy Light Clan, the Holy Light Clan could only give up on the Godwish Pearls, thus passing down this opportunity to the Dragon Clan and the other powers.<br>&ldquo;However, this opportunity could very well only come once unless the younger generation within the Holy Light Galaxy were to impress the Godwish Grandmother with their performance, or else such an opportunity might not come to the Holy Light Galaxy anymore.<br>&ldquo;Besides, you mentioned that you wanted to enter the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, right? You have seen the capabilities of the disciples of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect just a moment ago. While you&rsquo;re above him in terms of world spiritist techniques, your cultivation is no match for him at all.<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, what he has just said isn&rsquo;t just to scare you. Thre are indeed stronger disciples than him in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. Putting aside that it&rsquo;ll be difficult for you to enter the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect with your current cultivation, even if you were to manage to get in, what can you do?<br>&ldquo;Instead of challenging the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect in futility with your current cultivation, it would be a much better choice for you to undergo the training of the Godwish Palace first. With your talents, as long as you&rsquo;re able to clear the training, even if you aren&rsquo;t able to raise your cultivation by too much, you should still be able to take something out of it. Even if that&rsquo;s not the case, it&rsquo;s still a good opportunity for you to open your eyes and widen your scope too.&rdquo;<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist advised Chu Feng through voice transmission. He hoped Chu Feng could make full use of this golden opportunity to train at the Godwish Palace.<br>The others were oblivious to the voice transmission from the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. All they saw was Long Xiaoxiao pleading with Chu Feng to enter the Godwish Palace together with her.<br>And there was a look of hesitation on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face.<br>The Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief knew just how big of a price the Dragon Clan had to pay in order to obtain these two Godwish Pearls, so naturally, he was reluctant to hand one of the pearls over to an outsider.<br>He would rather give this opportunity to one of their own clan members.<br>This was a sentiment shared by the Supreme Elder also. His complexion didn&rsquo;t look too good after hearing Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s request.<br>So, Chu Feng&rsquo;s hesitation made them feel slightly relieved.<br>&ldquo;Xiaoxiao, young friend Chu Feng appears to have urgent business to attend to. If he doesn&rsquo;t want to head to the Godwish Palace, it wouldn&rsquo;t be appropriate for you to force him into it,&rdquo; the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief advised Long Xiaoxiao.<br>Upon hearing those words, the excitement on Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s face slowly faded, replaced by solemness instead.<br>Indeed. No matter how much she wished for Chu Feng to head to the Godwish Palace together with her, if Chu Feng was unwilling to go with her, what else could she do?<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, I&rsquo;m willing to head to the Godwish Palace with Princess Xiaoxiao.&rdquo;<br>But at this very moment, Chu Feng suddenly spoke up.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words from Chu Feng, both the faces of the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the Supreme Elder turned livid. They didn&rsquo;t think that Chu Feng would really agree to this matter.<br>&ldquo;This is an opportunity that doesn&rsquo;t come by often. I&rsquo;m flattered by Lord Clan Chief&rsquo;s generosity in bestowing this opportunity to Chu Feng, and I&rsquo;ll do my best not to let you down,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with an earnest smile on his face.<br>And upon hearing those words, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief nearly spurted blood.<br>Who the hell would give this opportunity to an outsider like you?<br>It could have just been a one-sided wish from Long Xiaoxiao, but you are actually so thick-skinned as to accept it!<br>Not only so, you even had the cheek to insist that it was I who bestowed this opportunity to you!<br>In truth, Chu Feng&rsquo;s hesitation was not just for show. He wanted to enter the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect to meet Zi Ling as soon as possible, but at the same time, what his master said made perfect sense too.<br>Putting aside the fact that it would be hard for him to challenge the teleportation formation of the HIdden Dragon Martial Sect with his current strength, even if he managed to get in, the chances of him saving Zi Ling was nearly null.<br>Since the Godwish Grandmother was such a formidable character, the Godwish Palace was likely to be an incredible place too. It was indeed a rare opportunity to enter the Godwish Palace, so after much consideration, Chu Feng decided to give it a try.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s wonderful! I&rsquo;ll be able to enter the Godwish Palace together with little benefactor!&rdquo;<br>As for the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, even though he was very reluctant to give this opportunity to Chu Feng, he had no choice but to swallow his grievances and give this opportunity to Chu Feng.<br>After all, Long Xiaoxiao was the future of the Dragon Clan now. He had no choice but to go along with his daughter&rsquo;s will.<br>Afterward, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief proceeded to calm down everyone within the Dragon Clan.<br>The overwhelming pressure that was coming from the golden radiance in the sky had left the clan members of the Dragon Clan feeling deeply frightened as they thought that a calamity had befallen their Dragon Clan.<br>Naturally, it was the duty of the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief to reassure at a time like this.<br>That being said, he didn&rsquo;t tell the truth to all of the clan members. After all, the dignity and face of the Dragon Clan were at stake here.<br>If the members of the Dragon Clan were to learn that a mere elder from the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect had scared their Clan Chief into silence, everyone within the Dragon Clan would surely be demoralized.<br>Fortunately, this was a problem that could be easily resolved by just making up an excuse, especially since the clan members of the Dragon Clan had absolute faith in their Clan Chief.<br>No one would dare to question his words anyway.<br>&hellip;<br>&ldquo;Master, are you not coming along with me?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist were the only ones left within the garden.<br>Chu Feng had a surprised look on his face at this very moment because his master had just informed him that he wouldn&rsquo;t be coming along with him.<br>&ldquo;I wanted to come along with you too, but I have a more important matter to attend to,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.<br>&ldquo;Master, what is it?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked out of curiosity.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s regarding Sima Xiangtu,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist replied.<br></p></div>
