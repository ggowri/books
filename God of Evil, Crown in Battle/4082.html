        <h1>Chapter 4081</h1>
        <div> - The Enraged Chu Feng<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Deep in the Purple Star Variance Realm. The experts from the Constellation Immortal Isle were all gathered at one location.<br>They had discovered a particularly dense amount of natural energies.<br>Their Supreme Elder was using the Star-guiding Stone to absorb them.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that the rank three Exalted Taboo is destined to be ours.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if we ignore the Star-guiding Stone Lord Isle Master obtained from the Chu Heavenly Clan, the Star-guiding Stone Lord Supreme Elder holds has already absorbed a boundless amount of natural energies.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That rank three Exlated Taboo most definitely belongs to our Constellation Immortal Isle.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Wherever our Constellation Immortal Isle goes, people will all withdraw. Who dares to compete with us?&rdquo;<br>While their Lord Supreme Elder was focused on absorbing the natural energies, the others from the Constellation Immortal Isle began to chitchat.<br>Their conversation fully revealed their sense of superiority, and how they looked down on others.<br>&ldquo;That said, what leaves me with the deepest impression would have to be that Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even though all powers will behave themselves before us Constellation Immortal Isle, it&rsquo;s still my first time seeing a power that was as scared as that Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. When Lord Isle Master taught their clan chief a lesson, those clansmen did not even dare to utter a single fart. They were so scared that all of them kneeled on the ground. Furthermore, I noticed that several of them even pissed themselves. They were all people that had cultivated for thousands of years. It seems that they&rsquo;ve wasted all their years living like a bunch of dogs. Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How did a power like that manage to become a starfield&rsquo;s overlord?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Wuming Clan back then was much stronger than them.&rdquo;<br>The people from the Constellation Immortal Isle were all unable to contain their laughter when the Chu Heavenly Clan was mentioned.<br>However, all of a sudden, the laughter and smiles on their faces disappeared. All of them turned to the same direction with alert looks.<br>A figure was approaching them.<br>However, after they got a clear view of the person that was approaching them, the nervousness on their face disappeared, and was replaced with mocking smiles.<br>The reason for that was because the person that had arrived was a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generation.<br>&ldquo;And here I was wondering who it was. Never would I have expected that it&rsquo;s actually some trash from the Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Wait, something&rsquo;s amiss. I thought that all the Chu Heavenly Clansmen had been scared witless by us and had fled from this place. Could it be that they didn&rsquo;t flee?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I suspect that this guy here must&rsquo;ve gotten lost from his clan. That&rsquo;s why he has no idea that his clan fled from us in fear.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Pitiful little trash, seeing that ignorant dumb look on your face, you might not even know who we are, right?&rdquo;<br>The people from the Constellation Immortal Isle were laughing mockingly at the sight of Chu Feng.<br>The gazes that they looked to Chu Feng with were filled with contempt and ridicule.<br>They believed him to be a powerless ant. They believed that any one of them could easily obliterate him.<br>&ldquo;Is it funny?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was also smiling. However, his smile didn&rsquo;t contain any sense of ridicule. There was only pity.<br>Seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s smile, the people from the Constellation Immortal Isle were all surprised.<br>&lsquo;What makes an ant think that it can pity us?&rsquo;<br>Because of his behavior, anger rose up in their hearts.<br>&ldquo;Trash like you dares to look at us in such a manner?! You&rsquo;re truly courting death!&rdquo;<br>Someone among the people from the Constellation Immortal Isle walked towards Chu Feng angrily.<br>Seeing that, the others all laughed repeatedly.<br>They all felt that Chu Feng was toast.<br>They all knew very well what sort of temper the fellow that was walking toward Chu Feng had.<br>He was someone who would not allow anyone to escape from him alive the moment he acted.<br>However, that man had only just approached Chu Feng when Chu Feng raised his hand and sent forth a palm strike. &ldquo;Bang!&rdquo; That man was sent flying.<br>Everything happened too quickly. By the time the crowd reacted to what had happened, that man&rsquo;s body had flown over ten thousand meters away and smashed into a giant boulder.<br>His body was completely mutilated, and his breath stopped.<br>He&hellip; had died.<br>&ldquo;This brat!&rdquo;<br>Seeing this scene, the first reaction of the people from the Constellation Immortal Isle was not fear, but rather anger.<br>They were the Constellation Immortal Isle, whereas Chu Feng was only a person of the younger generation from the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Trash like that dared to kill someone from their Constellation Immortal Isle?<br>That&hellip; was no longer only a capital offense!<br>It was an offense worthy of the extermination of his entire clan!<br>Because of that, countless oppressive mights rushed toward Chu Feng like giant violent waves.<br>While they were only oppressive mights, they were all filled with killing intent. None of them intended to hold back and spare Chu Feng&rsquo;s life. Those oppressive mights all rushed toward Chu Feng with the intention to kill him.<br>Actually, if it wasn&rsquo;t for the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s elders being present, they would&rsquo;ve already massacred the Chu Heavenly Clan when they plundered the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s Star-guiding Stone.<br>As such, it was only natural that they would not allow Chu Feng to leave alive.<br>Facing the incoming oppressive mights that intended to take his life, Chu Feng merely let out a cold snort.<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~~&rdquo;<br>Dazzling light sprung up from within him.<br>That was&hellip; world spirit power.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power had a sacred appearance, and incomparable power.<br>Before that spirit power, the oppressive mights of the people from the Constellation Immortal Isle collapsed instantly.<br>Everything happened too quickly. Before the people from the Constellation Immortal Isle could react to what was happening, they found their oppressive mights destroyed, and spirit power arriving before them like a magnificent army of thousands of men and horses.<br>&ldquo;Wuuuahhh~~~&rdquo;<br>Screams began to sound in succession.<br>In merely the blink of an eye, all the experts from the Constellation Immortal Isle were tossed to the ground.<br>The commotion caused even the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Supreme Elder, who was focused on absorbing the natural energies, to turn around and observe what was going on.<br>Upon doing so, his brows creased.<br>All the experts from his Constellation Immortal Isle were lying on the ground, drenched with blood.<br>Whilst they were alive, it seemed like they were all on the verge of death, and were unable to even move.<br>Regardless of their cultivation, they had all suffered the same sort of injury.<br>This was clearly a deliberate act. But, even so, it was very difficult to accomplish.<br>&ldquo;Spirit power.&rdquo;<br>Seeing the light that was still drifting on the ground, the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Supreme Elder knew what it was that had seriously injured his subordinates.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re that Chu Feng?&rdquo; That Supreme Elder looked to Chu Feng and asked with a stern voice.<br>Although it was the first time he had met Chu Feng, he could only imagine a single Chu Heavenly Clansmen that would be capable of defeating the experts from his Constellation Immortal Isle so effortlessly.<br>But, even though he already knew that the man before him was the legendary genius of the younger generation Chu Feng, the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Supreme Elder still looked at Chu Feng with a look of contempt.<br>He was confident in himself.<br>After all, he was second to only the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master.<br>&ldquo;Are you afraid to speak, afraid to acknowledge your identity?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brat, you dared to attack us. Regardless of whether or not you acknowledge your identity, you&rsquo;ve committed a capital offense. Not only will you die, but your Chu Heavenly Clan can also forget about living in peace.&rdquo;<br>Killing intent emerged in that Supreme Elder&rsquo;s eyes.<br>However, Chu Feng did not bother to pay any attention to him. Instead, his gaze landed on the Star-guiding Stone in the Supreme Elder&rsquo;s hand.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng made a grabbing motion towards the Star-guiding Stone from afar.<br>Boundless wind surged forth as a suction power emerged from Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand. That Supreme Elder found himself unable to hold onto the Star-guiding Stone.<br>By the time he reacted to what had happened, the Star-guiding Stone was already in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand.<br>&ldquo;You!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, that Supreme Elder&rsquo;s complexion turned deathly pale.<br>Earlier, he had been looking down on Chu Feng. Yet now, fear filled his eyes.<br></p></div>
