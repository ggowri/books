        <h1>Chapter 4337</h1>
        <div>: The Plan of the Mother-Daughter Duo<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A glimmer of expectation lit up in Long Mumu&rsquo;s eyes as she looked at her mother.<br>She noticed that when her mother said those words, not only was there a vicious look on her face, but there was a spark of confidence in her eyes too.<br>This meant that her mother wasn&rsquo;t just speaking empty words. She had the confidence to get things done.<br>&ldquo;Lord Mother, have you already thought of a way to deal with them?&rdquo; Long Mumu asked.<br>&ldquo;Mumu, take a look at this. This is what Elder Long Duan sent to me discreetly earlier.&rdquo; Long Mumu&rsquo;s mother took out a letter and passed it to Long Mumu.<br>Hearing those words, Long Mumu quickly received the letter and began reading it earnestly.<br>As it turned out, even the highly-esteemed Elder Long Duan was one of their own. He had always been helping them from the shadows.<br>It was just that this matter was not known even by the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. In fact, the only ones who knew about this were Long Mumu and her mother.<br>This letter not only revealed some of the matters concerning the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and Chu Feng, but it even made a suggestion to both of them.<br>It was a suggestion on how they should deal with Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>As such, the joy on Long Mumu&rsquo;s face intensified after reading through the letter.<br>&ldquo;So the two of them have actually offended the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted&rsquo;s disciple. That&rsquo;s as good as offending the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted himself!<br>&ldquo;Lord Mother, doesn&rsquo;t that mean that we can make use of this matter to have father deal with the two of them?&rdquo; Long Mumu asked.<br>With their influence in the Dragon Clan, they knew certain confidential secrets in the Dragon Clan that others weren&rsquo;t privy to.<br>The Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted had actually partnered with the Dragon Clan on certain matters, and this included a particularly formidable remnant.<br>This remnant had required collaboration between the Dragon Clan and the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted to open it.<br>It was just that they hadn&rsquo;t been able to come to an agreement on how they should split the profits, and there was even some displeasure that evolved out of it in the end. This led to the opening of that remnant being postponed for quite some time.<br>For this reason, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had visited the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted several times and lowered his demands in order to get the remnant opened, but the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted had turned him down.<br>If they could inform the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief about this matter, it would resolve this problem that had been bugging him for quite some time.<br>In Long Mumu&rsquo;s view, since Chu Feng and his master had such a grudge with the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted, the Dragon Clan could simply sell the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted a favor and toss those two over for the latter to deal with.<br>Perhaps the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted might relent in view of that, and choose to work with them to open the remnant.<br>While the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief cared a lot about his face and honor, what he prioritized was still the interests of the Dragon Clan.<br>&ldquo;As expected of my dear daughter, you have the same thoughts as me. I believe that Elder Long Duan must be thinking the same too.<br>&ldquo;Later on, we&rsquo;ll look for your father to talk about this matter. We&rsquo;ll say that we received this news from elsewhere. I believe that Elder Long Duan will also speak up on our behalf,&rdquo; Long Mumu&rsquo;s mother said.<br>&ldquo;Lord Mother, when are we going to make a move then?&rdquo; Long Mumu asked.<br>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t talk about this matter in public. Take my brooch and call your father over. And remember to invite Elder Long Duan over as well,&rdquo; Long Mumu&rsquo;s mother said as she took out the brooch in her hair.<br>&ldquo;Lord Mother, I&rsquo;ll be heading over right now!&rdquo;<br>Long Mumu immediately got to action after receiving the brooch.<br>She knew that this brooch was actually a treasure given by her father to her mother.<br>In fact, her father even gave the word that as long as she were to bring this brooch to him, she would be able to call him over regardless of the occasion.<br>And as it turned out, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief meant his words.<br>Everyone could tell that he was reluctant to take even a step away from the Dragon Vein Source, but as soon as Long Mumu arrived with the brooch, requesting for her father to come over, her father still went over to visit her mother.<br>After the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, together with Elder Long Duan, arrived at her mother&rsquo;s palace, the mother-daughter duo followed their plan and revealed the grudge Chu Feng and his master had with the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Long Duan, you were present at the scene then. Was there really such a matter?&rdquo; the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked Elder Long Duan.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, I can testify to this matter. Even though Chu Feng and his master possess outstanding capabilities, they are very arrogant individuals too. Not only did they injure the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted&rsquo;s disciple, but they even killed the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted and Grandmaster Luo Tuo.<br>&ldquo;Even though the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted and Grandmaster Luo Tuo tended to speak out of line, they didn&rsquo;t deserve death,&rdquo; Elder Long Duan said.<br>&ldquo;That pair of master and disciple is actually that vicious?&rdquo;<br>Upon learning of the matter, the gaze of the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief began to change.<br>&ldquo;Yes, they are vicious individuals. Back then, Grandmaster Ox even tried to kill all of the world spiritists on the spot. It was only when everyone begged him for mercy that he reluctantly let them off. While the two of them are world spiritists, their actions are no different from those of the demonic cult!<br>&ldquo;If we hadn&rsquo;t been so anxious to open the Dragon Vein Source, I wouldn&rsquo;t have invited the two of them into our Dragon Clan either. I had no choice, and I beg Lord Clan Chief to pardon me for this.&rdquo;<br>Elder Long Duan didn&rsquo;t lie on this matter, but he distorted certain facts in order to manipulate the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s impression, making him think that Chu Feng and his master were vile and unreasonable villains who deserved to be killed a thousand times over.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, I won&rsquo;t blame you for this matter. Regardless of what their characters are like, it&rsquo;s a fact that they are people of great capabilities,&rdquo; the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief replied.<br>&ldquo;Lord Father, even though those two are indeed capable, they are simply too brazen! If they dare to even threaten you, there&rsquo;s nothing in the world they would be incapable of pulling off!<br>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t understand where that lass, Long Xiaoxiao, came to know these people. They always say that birds of a feather flock together, and I think that Long Xiaoxiao has really fallen through the ranks these days.&rdquo;<br>Long Mumu added oil to the fire, making full use of this opportunity to implicate Long Xiaoxiao too.<br>However, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief didn&rsquo;t give a response right away. Instead, he turned to Long Mumu&rsquo;s mother and asked, &ldquo;Other than this matter, is there anything else you have for me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Husband, the characters of those two are fatally flawed. We cannot afford to trust them! I heard that they have requested to enter our Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Ground after opening the Dragon Vein Source, but the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Ground is of utmost importance to our Dragon Clan! How can we let outsiders, let alone people who have committed such atrocities, enter it?<br>&ldquo;In fact, I suspect that they might try to pull something in the Dragon Vein Source. Husband, I was simply too worried that you might be too trusting of them, so I called you over during this critical moment to remind you of this matter. I beg you for your pardon for this. I&rsquo;m simply too concerned about you and our Dragon Clan.&rdquo;<br>Long Mumu&rsquo;s mother didn&rsquo;t ask the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief to deal with Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist directly.<br>Instead, she simply stated her point of view and left the final decision in the hands of the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br></p></div>
