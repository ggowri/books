        <div> - Fury Of The Entire Clan<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><br>&ldquo;How did you manage to find him?&rdquo; Zi Xunyi asked.<br><br>&ldquo;I did not know of Senior Ying Mingchao before I ran into him, but I accidently encountered him after entering the Grief Calamity Mountain Range.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;If you plan to go save him, you must bring me with you. Only I know how to get to him,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br><br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; As Zi Xunyi spoke, she waved her sleeve, and a layer of overwhelming spirit power was emitted from her body.<br><br>Her spirit power directly engulfed Chu Feng and Li Yue&rsquo;er.<br><br>&ldquo;This spirit power,&rdquo; At that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed.<br><br>At that moment, he realized who had managed to breach Li Yue&rsquo;er&rsquo;s Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation.<br><br>It must have been Zi Xunyi. The reason for that was because Zi Xunyi was a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.<br><br>Furthermore, Chu Feng was able to sense that even though they were all Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists, Zi Xunyi&rsquo;s spirit power was much stronger than their own.<br><br>Likely, this Zi Xunyi was only a fine line away from becoming a Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. Her spirit power had reached a very powerful level already.<br>Zi Xunyi lifted Chu Feng and Li Yue&rsquo;er with her spirit power. She was protecting them.<br>She was planning to bring Chu Feng and Li Yue&rsquo;er away from there.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief waved his sleeve. Immediately, overwhelming martial power scattered about in all directions like sunshine basking everything. Soon, his martial power completely sealed off the region.<br>&ldquo;Do you wish to do as master did and trap me here until I die?&rdquo; Zi Xunyi cast her cold gaze to the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;I do not plan to trap you here. If you wish to leave, I will allow you to leave.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Merely, that brat&rsquo;s words have no proof at all. Why are you trusting him? What if it&rsquo;s a trap?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, even if what that brat says is true and Ying Mingchao is still alive, are you really planning to save him?&rdquo; The Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br><br>&ldquo;I must go save him,&rdquo; Zi Xunyi said.<br>&ldquo;Did he not hurt you enough? Why must you act like this?&rdquo; The Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br><br>&ldquo;He never hurt me. I am the one who owes him,&rdquo; Zi Xunyi said.<br><br>&ldquo;Then what about me? What am I to do? Today is our wedding day,&rdquo; The Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief grew emotional.<br>At that moment, the rest of the Bloodscale Monstrous Clansmen also grew emotional.<br>They finally knew who that Ying Mingchao was. Merely, the existence of that individual made them feel extremely displeased.<br>&ldquo;Zhenping, you&rsquo;ve treated me very well. Merely, I am sorry, I truly do not love you,&rdquo; After Zi Xunyi said those words, she brought Chu Feng and Li Yue&rsquo;er and charged toward the martial power sealing off the region.<br><br>&ldquo;Roar~~~&rdquo;<br><br>However, the next moment, a strange roar sounded from the martial power sealing off the region.<br>At the same time, the golden-bright and dazzling martial power started to change.<br>Crimson radiance was emitted from the golden martial power. Then, scales began to appear from the crimson radiance.<br>At this moment, Chu Feng was able to feel that the martial power sealing off this region had become incomparably solid and simply impregnable.<br>Most importantly, that was a martial power formation, and not a spirit formation.<br><br>Thus, when facing something like that, even world spirit techniques would be useless. The only way to breach it would be to use one&rsquo;s martial power.<br>However, merely by looking at it, one could tell how powerful that martial power formation was.<br>It was an extremely powerful martial power formation. It would be extremely difficult to break through it.<br><br>&ldquo;Is this the power of the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s bloodline?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng guessed in his heart. He felt that this was not an ordinary martial skill, nor was it a secret skill.<br>Chu Feng felt that this was most likely a technique using the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s bloodline&rsquo;s power. In other words, this was most likely something exclusive to only the Bloodscale Monstrous Clansmen.<br><br>It was similar to how Heavenly Bloodline possessors possessed the<br>Lightning<br>Armor,<br>Lightning<br>Wings and the Lightning Mark.<br><br>&ldquo;What if I refuse to allow you to leave?&rdquo; said the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. His tone had grown ill-intended.<br><br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, she can&rsquo;t be allowed to leave!&rdquo;<br><br>Right at that moment, two women flew out from the crowd and landed on the viewing platform.<br>They wore very gorgeous attire. Their cultivations were not weak either; they were both peak Martial Ancestors.<br><br>Furthermore, their appearances were very young too. However, Chu Feng was able to tell with a single glance that they were definitely not younger than Zi Xunyi.<br><br>Their youthful appearances were merely disguises using special methods. Additionally, they were not human, but two female Bloodscale Monstrous Clansmen.<br><br>&ldquo;Zi Xunyi, you are truly cruel and unscrupulous. How has my husband treated you? Even though your appearance has turned ugly, he still did not turn his back toward you in the slightest. His love for you is several times greater than his love for my son and me. Yet you&hellip; you actually still have that Ying Mingchao on your mind after all this time. Do you even have a conscience?&rdquo; One of the two women pointed at Zi Xunyi and cursed loudly. She was filled with complaint toward Zi Xunyi.<br>&ldquo;Husband, it has been over a thousand years now. You&rsquo;ve shown this Zi Xunyi overwhelming love. Yet, she has been thinking of that Ying Mingchao the entire time. Do you think someone like her is really worth it?&rdquo; The other woman turned to ask the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br><br>The Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief did not answer. However, his complexion had sunk.<br><br>Seeing that the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief did not answer, that woman turned to the rest of the Bloodscale Monstrous Clansmen and declared, &ldquo;Clansmen of our Bloodscale Monstrous Clan, you all have observed how your Lord Clan Chief has treated Zi Xunyi over the years.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Yet she has been deeply in love with another man the entire time. Tell me, is all the time and energy your Lord Clan Chief invested in her worth it?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No, it is not!!!&rdquo;<br>The Bloodscale Monstrous Clansmen shouted in unison. Intense anger was present in their tone when they spoke those words.<br>&ldquo;Zi Xunyi, you are nothing more than a wench!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You damned bitch!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Our Bloodscale Monstrous Clan has treated you so well in vain!&rdquo;<br>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>&hellip;&hellip;<br><br>The next moment, all of the Bloodscale Monstrous Clansmen turned their gazes toward Zi Xunyi and began to curse at her.<br>All kinds of malicious words were being thrown at Zi Xunyi without the slightest hesitation.<br><br>Evidently, they were only respectful toward Zi Xunyi because of their Lord Clan Chief.<br><br>Deep in their hearts, they actually felt enormous dislike toward Zi Xunyi. In fact, they deeply hated her.<br><br>Their hatred toward Zi Xunyi might be because she was a human.<br><br>However, Chu Feng felt that it was more likely because of the fact that their Lord Clan Chief had treated Zi Xunyi with such sincerity and love, yet was unable to obtain sincerity and love from her in return.<br>Perhaps because she was feeling guilty, Zi Xunyi did not utter a word from the curses of the tens of thousands of Bloodscale Monstrous Clansmen.<br><br>&ldquo;Shut up!!!&rdquo;<br><br>Right at that moment, the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief suddenly shouted.<br><br>After his shout, the Bloodscale Monstrous Clansmen all grew quiet. No one dared utter another word.<br><br>The plaza that was filled with curses grew absolutely silent.<br>&ldquo;Xunyi, even if you do not love me, it is fine. It is enough that I love you.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Today is the day of our marriage. Is it possible for you to not leave?&rdquo;<br><br>The Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief forcibly restrained the anger in his heart and spoke to Zi Xunyi with a gentle tone.<br>&ldquo;Unless you are to kill me, I must definitely leave here today,&rdquo; Zi Xunyi replied.<br>&ldquo;Kill her! Husband, you must definitely kill her today. This woman is simply unworthy of you to act like this.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Husband, look carefully&hellip; she simply does not have you in her heart at all. No matter how much you&rsquo;ve put forth on her behalf, it will all be useless.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Husband, even if you are able to make her stay, you will not be able to keep her heart. How could you marry a woman like her?&rdquo;<br>Those two women started to persuade the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief strenuously with tearful voices. It could be seen that they deeply detested Zi Xunyi.<br>&ldquo;Kill her!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Kill her!&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Kill her!&rdquo;<br><br>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>&hellip;&hellip;<br><br>The next moment, enormously angry shouts began to resonate through the vast plaza, resonate in the vast Demon Elimination Cave. It was as if the words &lsquo;kill her&rsquo; were echoing throughout the entire Demon Elimination Cave.<br>Zi Xunyi&rsquo;s coldness and strong attachment completely ignited the hatred for her in the hearts of the Bloodscale Monstrous Clansmen.<br>At that moment, practically all Bloodscale Monstrous Clansmen were shouting those two words - &lsquo;kill her.&rsquo;<br><br></p></div>
