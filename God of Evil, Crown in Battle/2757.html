        <div> - Arrival Of The Holy Daughter<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, why aren&rsquo;t you saying anything? Are you still mad at me? How about this, you can punch me a couple times. If a couple punches is not enough, you can punch me ten times, a hundred times. You can continue to punch me until you feel that your anger has lifted,&rdquo; Li Xiang said in a slightly panicky manner after seeing that Chu Feng was still silent.<br><br>&ldquo;Us too. If you&rsquo;re still angry, not to mention a hundred punches, even a thousand punches would be fine. As long as you don&rsquo;t beat us to death, you can do whatever you want,&rdquo; Li Xiang&rsquo;s two companions spoke nervously.<br><br>The words spoken by the three of them served to greater verify the guesses of the crowd.<br><br>There was no such thing as Chu Feng bullying and humiliating them. On the contrary, it was these three people from the Sacred Pellet Villa who were in the wrong.<br><br>Else, they would not be apologizing to Chu Feng like this.<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve said it earlier already. What happened between us was merely a misunderstanding. You all do not have to take it to heart. Just let bygones be bygones,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br><br>He was able to tell that what Li Xiang and his two companions said earlier were sincere words. Thus, the impression Chu Feng had toward them had changed somewhat.<br><br>It was not because they admired and idolized him that Chu Feng had a change of impression. Rather, it was because Chu Feng felt that they could be said to be honest individuals.<br><br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re really willing to forgive us?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Then, then can we become friends?&rdquo; Li Xiang asked Chu Feng.<br><br>He was very nervous and scared when he said those words. Chu Feng could even hear the trembling in his voice.<br><br>Following him, the other two men from the Sacred Pellet Villa also looked to Chu Feng with anticipating yet scared expressions.<br><br>It seemed that the three of them were all afraid that Chu Feng would refuse them.<br><br>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled and nodded.<br><br>&ldquo;Holy shit! Did you all hear that? I am Chu Feng&rsquo;s friend! I&rsquo;ve become friends with Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br><br>At that moment, Li Xiang was so overly excited that he started to shout at the crowd present. He was shouting very loudly. It seemed that he was itching to tell everyone of the matter.<br><br>Many people laughed at that scene. They all felt that Li Xiang was an amusing fellow.<br><br>However, Chu Feng noticed that Han Yu revealed a grin.<br><br>It was a mocking grin, a smile of contempt. When he smiled, even his expression changed. It was as if he was looking at clowns as he looked to Li Xiang and Chu Feng.<br><br>That&rsquo;s right, in Han Yu&rsquo;s eyes, Chu Feng was also a clown.<br><br>That being said, Han Yu was very proficient at disguising himself. Thus, that smile and that expression in his eyes only lasted for a split second.<br><br>Likely, as the crowd&rsquo;s attention was all focused on Chu Feng, Li Xiang, and his two companions, they would not have noticed Han Yu&rsquo;s mocking smile.<br><br>Suddenly, someone pointed to the distant sky and shouted, &ldquo;Look! It&rsquo;s the people from the Starfall Holy Land!&rdquo;<br><br>The crowd all raised their heads to look. Upon doing so, they discovered that there were many figures currently walking over in midair. They were extremely mighty and imposing, as they numbered several hundred.<br><br>Those people, regardless of their gender or age, were all wearing white clothes. Their clothes were very neat and tidy.<br><br>As they walked in the sky, they resembled people from the land of celestial immortals. They were noble and graceful.<br><br>They were walking with a very natural pace. Yet, their speed was extremely fast.<br><br>That being said, there was a single exception to all of them. That person was not walking in the sky. Rather, that person was sitting on a sedan chair.<br><br>That sedan chair was very large. It resembled a small mobile palace. Even though it was not being carried by anyone, it was able to fly together with the crowd.<br><br>That sedan chair was like a sacred object being escorted and protected by the people from the Starfall Holy Land.<br><br>That sedan chair seemed to be made of jade. A spotlessly-white fluttering gauze covered the sedan chair. That gauze possessed an isolation ability that made it so that others would not be able to see who it was inside the sedan chair. Not even Chu Feng was able to see through the gauze.<br><br>While there were a lot of experts present, the strongest individuals would be the eight old men gathered around the sedan chair.<br><br>Not only did those eight old men look exactly the same, but they were all wearing spotlessly white clothes. Their expressions were ice-cold, and they did not even blink. It was as if they were completely void of emotions.<br><br>Most importantly, the eight of them were extremely powerful. Their power was akin to bottomless wells. No one was able to see through them.<br><br>Their auras were extremely strong. Seeing them, one would feel reverence from the bottom of one&rsquo;s heart.<br><br>They were existences akin to gods, beings that one could not be disrespectful toward.<br><br>Thus, when those eight old men appeared, everyone present became much weaker by comparison. Even the Sacred Pellet Villa&rsquo;s Ma Changchun couldn't be compared with the eight of them.<br><br>Starfall Eight Immortals. Those were the renowned Starfall Eight Immortals.<br><br>At that moment, the crowd burst into an uproar. This was especially true for the younger generation&rsquo;s men. Their eyes were shining brightly.<br><br>After all, the appearance of all eight of the Starfall Eight Immortals at the same time could only mean one thing -- that the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Daughter Xia Yun&rsquo;er had arrived.<br><br>Thus, the crowd were able to determine with certainty who the person sitting inside the sedan chair surrounded by the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s genius-level younger generations and experts was.<br><br>It was most definitely the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Daughter, Xia Yun&rsquo;er.<br><br>Who was Xia Yun&rsquo;er? Not only was she the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Daughter, but she was also the holy maiden in the hearts of countless men in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br><br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Daughter. She&rsquo;s one of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s Three Great Beauties. I am truly fortunate to be able to see the true appearance of the Holy Daughter,&rdquo; At that moment, Li Xiang was so excited that saliva started to drool down his mouth.<br><br>As for the two men behind Li Xiang, their reactions were even more ridiculous. They were actually shivering in excitement. Even their hairs was standing erect. Chu Feng was even able to hear the sound of their accelerating heartbeats. &ldquo;Putt, putt,&rdquo; their hearts were beating so fast that they were about to jump out of their bodies.<br><br>&ldquo;You all are overthinking. The Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Daughter is famous for being reserved. Many people of the younger generation with extraordinary status and strength were all refused by her when they wanted to see her.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that not long ago, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Chu Xianshuo and others were also refused and locked outside when they attempted to see her,&rdquo; Someone said.<br><br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually that hard to see her?&rdquo;<br><br>Hearing those words, many people of the younger generation revealed disappointed expressions.<br><br>The Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Daughter was right before them. If they weren&rsquo;t able to see her even at such a distance, then it would be impossible for them to see her in their lifetime.<br><br>&ldquo;Perhaps the Holy Daughter will make a rare exception today,&rdquo; Right at that moment, Han Yu said.<br><br>Right after saying those words, the crowd all turned their gazes to him. Even the experts from the older generations looked over to him.<br><br>The crowd were all silent. However, their anticipating gazes had revealed to Han Yu that they all wanted to know why Han Yu said those words.<br><br>&ldquo;I am fortunate. I have met the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Daughter three times. The relationship between us is pretty decent.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Right now, I, Han Yu, am right here. The Holy Daughter should reveal herself to see me,&rdquo; Han Yu said.<br><br>&ldquo;Lord Han Yu, is what you said the truth?! We will really be fortunate enough to see the Holy Daughter?!&rdquo;<br><br>At that moment, many of the younger generations present began to shout in excitement.<br><br>Han Yu did not answer their questions. Instead, he revealed a faint smile on his face. His smile was filled with confidence.<br><br>At the same time, he walked away from the center of the crowd and stood at the front. What he was planning to do was very simple. He wanted to be noticed by Xia Yun&rsquo;er.<br><br>Right at that moment, the people from the Starfall Holy Land approached. An attractive force suddenly spread forth.<br><br>The crowd knew that the people from the Starfall Holy Land, including the Holy Daughter, would be sucked to the plaza by the attractive force.<br><br>Thinking about that, the crowd grew even more excited.<br><br>After all, they would soon meet the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s most noble Holy Daughter.<br><br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br><br>However, right at the moment when that attractive power swept forth to engulf the people from the Starfall Holy Land, one of the Starfall Eight Immortals gently flung his sleeve. Then, a layer of martial power emerged and surrounded everyone from the Starfall Holy Land.<br><br>Then, even though the attractive power continued to attack them, trying to suck them into the plaza, the people from the Starfall Holy Land were able to safely proceed onward.<br><br>&ldquo;Sssss~~~&rdquo;<br><br>Seeing this scene, the crowd were unable to contain themselves from sucking in a mouthful of cold air.<br><br>It was only at that moment that they recalled that  the Starfall Eight Immortals were extremely powerful Martial Immortals.<br><br>Admittedly, the power of the plaza&rsquo;s attractive force was very strong and capable of forcibly sucking everyone present into the plaza.<br><br>However, it was completely useless before the Starfall Eight Immortals.<br><br><br></p></div>
