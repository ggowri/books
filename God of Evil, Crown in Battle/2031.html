        <div> - Powerful Reinforcement<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Crap, that Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beast is too powerful. If this is to continue, Her Highness will not be able to withstand it.&rdquo;<br>After fighting for some time, the expressions of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves grew increasingly ugly. Even though Xian Miaomiao was very powerful, that Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beast was growing increasingly fierce.<br>At that moment, that Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beast had taken the advantage in the battle. Furthermore, its dominance was grower larger and larger. It had begun to completely suppress Xian Miaomiao and trample upon her.<br>Sure enough, that Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beast was different from all the others. Its attacks were not made absent-mindedly. Instead, it was more like an intelligent being, filled with battle experience. Otherwise, with Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s strength, it would be impossible for her to be beaten to such a degree.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, that Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beast unleashed a fist explosively. Xian Miaomiao hurriedly lifted up her sword to block its fist.<br>&ldquo;Wuaah~~&rdquo;<br>However, the might of that fist was truly too powerful. Even though Xian Miaomiao had blocked it with her sword, she was still knocked several meters back. By the time she managed to steady herself, blood was already flowing out the corners of her mouth.<br>&ldquo;Damn it! Think of a way to get me out there!&rdquo; Seeing Xian Miaomiao injured, the Elf Protector started to panic.<br>&ldquo;Lord Elf Protector, there is simply nothing we can do,&rdquo; At that moment, the Elf Lord revealed an expression of helplessness.<br>There was only a single exit to that grand formation. However, it was blocked by Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s golden bell. As such, they were simply unable to leave.<br>&ldquo;Roar~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, that Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beast let out a roar again. Then, its attacks grew even fiercer.<br>After being injured, Xian Miaomiao was evidently weaker than before. This time around, she was forced into an absolutely passive state against the ruthless onslaught of that Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beast.<br>&ldquo;What do we do now?!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves were truly panicking. Some among them were on the verge of collapse.<br>The reason for that was because if this were to continue, Xian Miaomiao would definitely be killed.<br>However&hellip; they, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves, absolutely could not lose their genius, Xian Miaomiao.<br>&ldquo;Girl, I urge you to concede. It is still not too late for you to admit defeat now,&rdquo; The mysterious woman said with a light smile.<br>She was like a spectator watching a show with a calm and composed expression on her face.<br>&ldquo;You wish for me to go with you? In your dreams!&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao shouted stubbornly.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite stubborn,&rdquo; Hearing those words, that woman smiled once more. Then, she said, &ldquo;In that case, I must teach you a lesson.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, ruthlessness flashed through the eyes of that mysterious woman. She shouted, &ldquo;Cripple her!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Rooarrr~~~&rdquo;<br>Once those words were said, that Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beast appeared as if it had received a command. It began to roar. Then, its attacks grew even more ferocious. Each and every attack became fatal. It seemed to be trying to kill Xian Miaomiao.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that you&rsquo;ll be disappointed. Today, you will not be able to kill anyone.&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment of imminent peril, a man&rsquo;s voice sounded from the sky.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>After that voice was heard, two enormous stone humanoids appeared out of thin air. They descended from the sky and ruthlessly stomped that Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beast deep into the ground. Then, they brandished their stone weapons and began to hack that Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beast to death.<br>&ldquo;Wh-What are those?&rdquo;<br>Everything happened too quickly. Not to mention the people from the Dark Hall, even the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves turned pale with fright.<br>The reason for that was because those two stone giants were truly too frightening. Even though they were also emitting the aura of rank eight Martial Emperors, they managed to kill that Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beast in merely a couple strikes.<br>Even though they had sneak attacked that Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beast when it was distracted with attacking Xian Miaomiao to kill it instantly, it remained that what they did was impossible to accomplish unless they possessed absolute strength.<br>Most importantly, where did those two stone giants appear from? Could they be monstrous beasts? But, there had never been any record of this sort of monstrous beast in the Holy Land of Martialism.<br>&ldquo;Step~~~&rdquo;<br>Just when everyone was astonished by the two stone giants, a figure suddenly descended from the sky and landed beside Xian Miaomiao. He placed his palm on Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s shoulder and transmitted a gentle energy into her body and began healing her injuries.<br>Xian Miaomiao was also focused on the two enormous stone giants that had appeared out of nowhere when the sudden gentle energy entered her body. That energy caused the pain she felt from her wounds to immediately lessen by a lot. She turned her head and discovered that Chu Feng was standing beside her.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng,&rdquo; When she saw Chu Feng, Xian Miaomiao reacted as if she had seen a close relative. Immediately, a brilliant smile blossomed on her little face.<br>&ldquo;My apologies. I&rsquo;ve come late,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;......&rdquo; Hearing those words, Xian Miaomiao was startled. She had come a realization. Regardless of where those two stone monsters came from, they were definitely related to Chu Feng and were brought here by Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re actually alive?&rdquo; However, upon seeing Chu Feng, that mysterious woman revealed a shocked expression.<br>&ldquo;Are you very disappointed that I am alive?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say disappointed. Merely, I&rsquo;m a bit surprised,&rdquo; The mysterious woman smiled sweetly. It was as if Chu Feng&rsquo;s life and death was truly unrelated to her.<br>&ldquo;The fact that I am alive will mean that you all will be the ones to die,&rdquo; Chu Feng narrowed his eyes.<br>&ldquo;It seems to me that it has not been long since we last met. Your strength has not increased by much. Since when did you learn how to boast?&rdquo; The mysterious woman mocked.<br>&ldquo;Hehe&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng was not angered by the mysterious woman&rsquo;s mockery. Instead, he laughed lightly.<br>The Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves were confused by Chu Feng&rsquo;s confident laughter.<br>Even though the two stone giants Chu Feng had brought with him were very powerful, it remained that there were only two of them.<br>But, the sensation that mysterious woman gave off was truly unfathomable. They felt that those two stone giants would likely not be able to defeat her.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>&hellip;&hellip;<br>However, right at that moment, rumbles sounded from far away. Following that, the earth started to tremble violently. It was as if there was an earthquake.<br>In that sort of situation, more and more enormous stone monsters began to appear in the crowd&rsquo;s line of sight.<br>&ldquo;Heavens! Those are all stone monstrous beasts. How could there be that many?!!!!&rdquo;<br>Seeing the several thousands of enormous stone monsters walking over like a well-trained army, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves were all astonished.<br>As for the people from the Dark Hall, they were all deeply frightened.<br>After all, those thousands of enormous stone monsters were all Martial Emperors. If those stone monsters were to join the battle, the superiority of their Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts would be completely obliterated.<br>&ldquo;Lady Xue Ji, l-let&rsquo;s leave.&rdquo;<br>In a panic, someone spoke to that mysterious woman.<br>However, that mysterious woman ignored that suggestion. At the same time, there was not the slightest trace of fear in her eyes.<br>Instead, she spoke to Chu Feng in a profound manner. &ldquo;Not bad. It seems that you have truly obtained a good harvest from the Five Elements Secret Skills. Could it be that World Devastator and Immeasurable, those two trash, have already died?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Forget about it, their lives and deaths are unrelated to me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, I must admit, your arrival today has saved the lives of those Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng&hellip; let us meet again.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, the mysterious woman&rsquo;s body shifted, and she disappeared into thin air.<br>&ldquo;Lady Xue Ji, please don&rsquo;t abandon us!!!&rdquo;<br>In response, the people from the Dark Hall started to panic.<br>They had come here and attacked aggressively because they were relying on the backing of that mysterious woman. Now that mysterious woman had left, how could these people possibly be a match for the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves and that army of stone monsters?<br>If that mysterious woman were to abandon them, only death would await them.<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng ordered, &ldquo;Kill them all. Leave none alive.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Roar~~~&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s words caused the people from the Dark Hall to act as if they were petrified. They stood there stunned. Deep fear covered their previously ferocious gazes.<br>When Chu Feng&rsquo;s order was given, the thousands of stone monsters began to surround and attack them.<br>Especially those two rank eight Martial Emperor stone giants. In merely the blink of an eye, they arrived within the Dark Hall&rsquo;s army, massacring them.<br><br></p></div>
