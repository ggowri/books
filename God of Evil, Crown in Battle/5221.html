        <h1>Chapter 5221</h1>
        <div>: A Father Who Is Worse Than a Beast<br>&ldquo;Hehehe&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The Demon Spirit King wasn&rsquo;t angered by Xue Ji&rsquo;s rejection at all. Instead, he chuckled innocently. This was a side to him that only Xue Ji could see.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all thanks to you, Xue Ji. I didn&rsquo;t make any advancement in my cultivation, but I feel like peak True God level is no longer out of my reach,&rdquo; the Demon Spirit King said excitedly.<br>Peak True God level was a height that he would never dare dream of in the past, but he could see a ray of hope now thanks to the terrifying medicine he had consumed.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have the time to slowly wait for you. You must quickly become stronger. Use this.&rdquo;<br>Xue Ji passed a scroll over to the Demon Spirit King.<br>&ldquo;This is&hellip; a cultivation skill?&rdquo;<br>With a quick glance, the Demon Spirit King could tell that it was a formidable cultivation skill, but it was a demonic skill that used the lives of others to nourish himself. Of course, the Demon Spirit King was already accustomed to killing others so the lives of others didn&rsquo;t matter to him.<br>The only person who truly mattered to him was Xue Ji.<br>He felt that this cultivation skill was tailored just for him.<br>&ldquo;My Xue Ji, just who in the world are you? Why do you have so many formidable things with you?&rdquo;<br>The Demon Spirit King could hardly believe his eyes as he browsed the scroll. In a sense, one could say that the cultivation skill was even more formidable than the terrifying pill.<br>&ldquo;Do you want to cultivate it? It won&rsquo;t be easy. You&rsquo;ll have to pay a heavy price, and there&rsquo;s no turning back once you start. You&rsquo;ll be condemned to a life of endless slaughter,&rdquo; Xue Ji said.<br>&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;ll cultivate it. If I master this cultivation skill, I&rsquo;ll definitely be able to reach peak True God level!&rdquo; the Demon Spirit King said confidently.<br>Hearing those words, Xue Ji&rsquo;s lips simply curled into an evil smile.<br>&hellip;<br>After a short journey, Chu Feng finally returned to the realm where Yue Ling and Song Yuwei were at. However, he didn&rsquo;t head for the Nameless Sect but instead went somewhere else.<br>He had told Yue Ling and the others to hide somewhere else first lest the other powers try to exact vengeance on them over the incident with the Nine Levels Pavilion. He had given Yue Ling a communication treasure, telling her to relay their location to him after settling down.<br>The place Chu Feng was heading to was where Yue Ling had settled down.<br>&ldquo;Milord, we weren&rsquo;t the ones who inflicted harm on Yue Ling. It really wasn&rsquo;t us!&rdquo;<br>But as soon as those from the Nameless Sect saw Chu Feng, they immediately kneeled on the ground, as if they were afraid of being implicated in something.<br>Sensing that something was amiss, Chu Feng immediately activated his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes to assess the situation. He soon found Yue Ling&rsquo;s silhouette in a nearby palace, and his heart skipped a beat.<br>Yue Ling&rsquo;s dantian had burst, causing her to lose her cultivation. To make things worse, she had been disfigured too.<br>&ldquo;Who did it? Is it the Nine Levels Pavilion? Or is it someone related to young master Wolf?&rdquo; Chu Feng bellowed.<br>Overwhelming killing intent poured out from him.<br>It hadn&rsquo;t been long since he was acquainted with Yue Ling, but the latter had helped him greatly. She granted him access to her ancestral land, which allowed him to obtain her family&rsquo;s legacy and heal Song Yuwei&rsquo;s injuries.<br>He couldn&rsquo;t forgive anyone who was so vicious to harm someone as kind as Yue Ling.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not sure either. This morning, Yue Ling made a trip to the Nameless Sect, only to return to such a sect. We tried asking her what happened, but she wouldn&rsquo;t say a thing. Milord, you should ask her yourself. She might be willing to tell you,&rdquo; one of the Nameless Sect&rsquo;s disciples said.<br>Chu Feng quickly headed into the palace where Yue Ling was resting.<br>&ldquo;Benefactor? You&rsquo;re here. Lord Yuwei&rsquo;s injuries recovered shortly after you arrived, and she has already left the Nameless Sect to head to where Lord Bitter Remembrance is.&rdquo;<br>As soon as Yue Ling sensed Chu Feng&rsquo;s arrival, she began talking about Song Yuwei&rsquo;s whereabouts as she figured that he would be worried about her. She also quickly put on a veil, possibly because she didn&rsquo;t want Chu Feng to see her current appearance.<br>Even so, Chu Feng was still able to see that state of her face through his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes. Someone had used a dagger to slowly disfigure her one stroke at a time, completely messing up her face.<br>&ldquo;Yue Ling, I already know what happened. Tell me who is the culprit. I&rsquo;ll make them pay the price. If you don&rsquo;t speak, I&rsquo;ll just have to look for the culprit myself,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Benefactor, are you able to exact vengeance for me?&rdquo;<br>Yue Ling had been feigning composure all this while, but she was unable to hold herself back anymore upon hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words. Her eyes reddened and her body started trembling. Before long, she had already broken down into tears.<br>Her words surprised Chu Feng.<br>He knew that Yue Ling was not the type of person who liked to impose on others, so he thought that she would try to stop him from interfering in the matter. Yet, she was asking him to exact vengeance for her instead.<br>Just how much grudge did that kind girl accumulate inside of her to act in such a manner?<br>&ldquo;Yue Ling, who&rsquo;s the culprit?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Benefactor, I have been duped. My father&hellip; my father&hellip; He didn&rsquo;t feel guilty about my mother&rsquo;s death at all. He&hellip; he really is a beast! He didn&rsquo;t put me in the Nameless Sect because he was unable to face my mother. He really abandoned me! He really abandoned me&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng could hear the utter despair in Yue Ling&rsquo;s choked-up cries.<br>&ldquo;Yue Ling, what happened?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Just this morning, my father came to look for me. He gave me a fortune, telling me not to return to the Nameless Sect and the ancestral land no matter what happens. He urged me to quickly leave this realm, or else I&rsquo;ll have to suffer the consequences. He left right after saying that.<br>&ldquo;But it has been so many years since I last saw my father. I missed him so much, but he left right after saying those words that I don&rsquo;t understand at all. How could I possibly live with that? So, I headed to the Nameless Sect&rsquo;s ancestral land, only to see two strangers there, a lady and a young man.<br>&ldquo;When the lady saw me, she&hellip; she&hellip; she actually knew my mother! She told me&hellip; told me that&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Yue Ling had completely broken down by this point that she couldn&rsquo;t even speak anymore.<br>Chu Feng quietly looked at Yue Ling, not saying a word at all. He knew that Yue Ling must have suffered a huge blow for her to get so upset, and it was definitely related to her father.<br>No words could possibly console such grief. All he could do was to give her the space to vent her emotions.<br>&ldquo;My father is a beast! He&hellip; he was the one who caused my mother&rsquo;s death!&rdquo;<br>Yue Ling revealed the shocking truth.<br>She had previously told Chu Feng that her mother had died trying to protect her father, and her father was reminded of that every time he looked at Yue Ling. He couldn&rsquo;t live with himself, so he eventually entrusted her to the Nameless Sect.<br>But somehow, the story had turned into Yue Ling&rsquo;s father being the one who caused the death of Yue Ling&rsquo;s mother.<br>&ldquo;Yue Ling, what in the world happened?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Yue Ling slowly revealed the full story to Chu Feng.<br>Due to Yue Ling&rsquo;s limited talent, Yue Ling&rsquo;s father thought that he couldn&rsquo;t entrust the Yue Clan&rsquo;s inheritance into her hands. He wanted to have another child as his successor, but Yue Ling&rsquo;s mother refused to do so, insisting that they give all their love to Yue Ling.<br>Due to that, Yue Ling&rsquo;s father decided to look for another woman to bear a successor for him. During his search, he encountered a formidable woman who made him fall head over heels for her.<br>When that woman learned that Yue Ling&rsquo;s father had a wife and a daughter, she made him choose between them. She told Yue Ling&rsquo;s father to either get rid of Yue Ling and her mother or never meet her ever again.<br>Astonishingly, Yue Ling&rsquo;s father actually chose the woman over them!<br>He didn&rsquo;t personally kill Yue Ling&rsquo;s mother, but he was indeed the perpetrator behind it. After committing such a vile deed, he still had the cheek to use guilt as an excuse to abandon Yue Ling.<br>The truth was that Yue Ling&rsquo;s father became a loving couple with that venomous woman after casting her aside. In fact, according to that woman, he even scoured the world in search of precious herbs to build her foundation up so that she could bear a talented child for him.<br>After much preparation, they finally had a son together, and he was none other than the young man she saw in the Nameless Sect&rsquo;s ancestral land.<br>The venomous woman had never seen Yue Ling before, but she had seen a portrait of Yue Ling&rsquo;s mother. Due to that, she was able to tell right away that Yue Ling didn&rsquo;t die back then.<br>It was truly perplexing why she bore such a huge grudge toward Yue Ling and her mother even though they had never met before. Yue Ling&rsquo;s mother was already dead and Yue Ling had been abandoned by her father for many years, but she was still unwilling to let Yue Ling off the hook.<br>She flew into a rage and told Yue Ling about the cruel truth, putting the latter in great pain. As if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, she went on to cripple Yue Ling&rsquo;s cultivation and disfigured her face.<br>She didn&rsquo;t take Yue Ling&rsquo;s life not because she was merciful but because she wanted the latter to live in pain.<br>&ldquo;Bastards! Are they still in your ancestral land?&rdquo; Chu Feng raged.<br>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see my father in the ancestral land, but that woman and her son are there,&rdquo; Yue Ling replied amidst sobs.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng lifted Yue Ling up and the two of them made their way to her ancestral land.<br></div>
