        <div> - Little Fishy?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Did my grandma tell you that it&rsquo;ll be impossible to leave the Heaven-devouring Realm after entering it?&rdquo; asked Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>&ldquo;My grandma lied to you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s actually a way to leave . Merely, that method is very dangerous. It requires an Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I were on my own it would be very difficult for me to help you leave. However, with my big brother&rsquo;s help we will most likely be able to help you,&rdquo; said Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Might you be willing to tell me about the specifics of this method?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;The method would be to enter the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts&rsquo; territory, inside that blazing cliff.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, inside that blazing cliff, our Demon Vanquishing Clan&rsquo;s Demon Vanquishing Talisman will become ineffective against the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is the reason why my grandma told you there&rsquo;s no way out.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is truly very dangerous. Facing all those Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts, it would be not excessive to say that it would be near-certain death.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, my big brother is very courageous. Furthermore, he has always wanted to leave this Heaven-devouring Realm. Thus, he has researched for many years, and had great insights.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you want to leave this place, he will definitely help you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, the premise would be to rescue him first,&rdquo; said Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng came to a realization.<br>Things were actually pretty much as he had expected.<br>It was actually possible to leave, however he would need to pass through the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts to leave.<br>What Chu Feng did not expect was that even the Demon Vanquishing Clan&rsquo;s ability to restrain the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts would become ineffective inside that blazing cliff.<br>Thinking about how powerful that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast was, Chu Feng wondered how he would be able to confront something like that without restraints on it.<br>It was no wonder the old granny insisted with determination that there was no way to leave.<br>It was actually as Fumo Xin&rsquo;er had said. That old granny did not possess any malice. She merely did not wish for them to attempt such a dangerous thing.<br>That said, if she was worried, Chu Feng had something else he was unable to understand.<br>If she knew that her grandson was in danger, why did that old granny refuse to go save him?<br>&ldquo;How did your big brother and that Netherworld Ice Hall come into conflict with one another?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, what is the sealed territory your grandma spoke of?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked curiously.<br>Since he was going to rescue someone, he would need to know roughly what had happened.<br>As for the sealed territory, he asked about that purely out of curiosity.<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er did not attempt to conceal anything. She began to answer Chu Feng&rsquo;s questions.<br>The sealed territory was where their Demon Vanquishing Clan and the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts resided.<br>Like how the Heaven-devouring Realm was cut off from the rest of the world, the sealed territory was cut off from the rest of the Heaven-devouring Realm.<br>Furthermore, practically everyone from the Heaven-devouring Realm knew about the Heaven-devouring Beasts.<br>In fact, many people viewed them as gods.<br>However, those people all believed that the Heaven-devouring Beasts were already extinct.<br>Apart from the Demon Vanquishing Clan, practically no one in the entire Heaven-devouring Realm knew of the existence of the Heaven-devouring Beasts.<br>The reason for that is all because the sealed territory was cut off from the rest of the Heaven-devouring Realm.<br>It was simply impossible for outsiders to enter the sealed region. Furthermore, they also did not know of its existence.<br>As for that Netherworld Ice Hall, they were the current ruler of the Heaven-devouring Realm.<br>Merely, they were brutal and inhuman rulers.<br>The Netherworld Ice Hall had reduced the Heaven-devouring Realm to purgatory.<br>The mysterious technique that the people from the Netherworld Ice Hall trained in was a very fierce and ruthless sort of mysterious technique.<br>It needed the souls of cultivators in order to train.<br>That aspect of theirs greatly resembled that of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts.<br>Because of that, the Netherworld Ice Hall considered the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts as gods.<br>Even the Netherworld Ice Hall&rsquo;s totems were constructed according to the appearance of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts.<br>That said, the Netherworld Ice Hall was much more ruthless than the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts.<br>Every year, tens of millions of people would die at the hands of the Netherworld Ice Hall.<br>The powers of the Heaven-devouring Realm would all have to pay tribute to the Netherworld Ice Hall every year.<br>Merely, their tributes were living people.<br>&ldquo;Because of that, your big brother was unable to tolerate the Netherworld Ice Hall&rsquo;s wicked behavior and attacked them?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You can say that.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It was mainly because he saw a little girl being captured by the people from the Netherworld Ice Hall.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;My brother was truly incapable of tolerating their behavior. Because of that, he tried to save the little girl.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, not only did he fail to rescue the little girl, he instead got himself captured.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That little girl has been brought to the Netherworld Ice Hall&rsquo;s main palace now. She will definitely not be able to escape this calamity.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Little Fishy is truly pitiful.&rdquo;<br>As Fumo Xin&rsquo;er shook her head, she sighed with regret.<br>Hearing her words, Chu Feng reacted as if he had pulled some sort of vein, as emotions suddenly filled his mind.<br>Even Chu Feng&rsquo;s tone changed as he asked, &ldquo;Little Fishy? Who is this Little Fishy you&rsquo;re speaking of?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Little Fishy is that little girl I told you about, the little girl my brother tried to rescue. Why are you acting so emotional? Could it be that you know her?&rdquo;<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er blinked her large eyes and looked at Chu Feng with surprise after seeing how emotionally he was reacting.<br>&ldquo;Did you see that Little Fishy that you spoke of? Do you know what sort of little girl she is?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ve seen her before. She&rsquo;s a little girl with exceptional talent.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Her origin is extremely mysterious. No one knows where she came from, and no one knows who her parents are.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, that little girl is extremely fond of water. Her swimming speed is extremely fast, even faster than the aquatic monstrous beasts.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even though she&rsquo;s very young, she has a very decent appearance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Speaking of it, I am also very fond of that girl. Unfortunately I am powerless to do anything about her current situation,&rdquo; Fumo Xin&rsquo;er sighed.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng reacted as if he had been struck by lightning, and stood there completely stunned.<br>A long time passed before he was finally able to recover somewhat.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng released his spirit power and enveloped Fumo Xin&rsquo;er with it.<br>&ldquo;Show me the way.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng&rsquo;s speed grew faster all of a sudden.<br>Earlier, it was Fumo Xin&rsquo;er bringing Chu Feng along.<br>Yet, at that moment it was Chu Feng bringing Fumo Xin&rsquo;er along.<br>Chu Feng activated his Nine Dragons Saint Cloak, bloodline power and rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation, all his abilities to increase the strength of his world spirit techniques.<br>With his fastest speed, he rushed towards the Netherworld Ice Hall.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; how could you be this powerful?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would appear that I&rsquo;ve underestimated you.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s sudden display of his strength had evidently shocked Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>However, her expression soon changed.<br>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t possibly really know that Little Fishy right?&rdquo; Fumo Xin&rsquo;er looked at Chu Feng with shock.<br>&ldquo;I know someone by the name of Little Fishy, If that Little Fishy is as you described, they could very possibly be the same person,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re kidding. How could there be such a coincidence?&rdquo; Fumo Xin&rsquo;er didn&rsquo;t believe him.<br>&ldquo;Regardless, I must go and have a look,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Even if they&rsquo;re the same person, you still wouldn&rsquo;t be able to save her.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There was still a chance to save her before. However, after my big brother failed to save her, Little Fishy was taken to be imprisoned in the Netherworld Ice Hall&rsquo;s main palace.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That place is guarded by peak Utmost Exalted-level experts.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, Little Fishy is the sacrifice that the Netherworld Ice Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master plans to use to train.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for that Netherworld Ice Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master, he&rsquo;s a Martial Exalted-level expert.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unless you&rsquo;re able to contend against a Martial Exalted-level expert, then, not to mention saving her, you won&rsquo;t even be able to approach her,&rdquo; said Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t say anything. He continued onward.<br>That said, whilst he was traveling his hand moved toward his chest.<br>There was a pendant around his neck the entire time.<br>That pendant just so happened to hang down to his chest, and was hidden under his clothes.<br>That pendant was actually very simple and crude.<br>It was a little stone tied to a hemp rope.<br>However, that pendant was something Little Fishy had given him.<br>Little Fishy was the little girl that Chu Feng had encountered in the Eastern Sea Region.<br>Even though they had only interacted for a very short period of time, Little Fishy had left a deep impression on Chu Feng.<br>Later on, Chu Feng had attempted to search for her.<br>However, not to mention the Eastern Sea Region, he had failed to find her in the entire Ancestral Martial Lower Realm.<br>With that, Chu Feng came to a conclusion that Little Fishy must&rsquo;ve left the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm. That said, he had no idea where she had gone.<br>He had originally thought that their parting back then would be the last time they saw one another.<br>He had never expected to find her in that place.<br>Although it was also possible that the Little Fishy who had been captured was someone else, and their names were merely a coincidence, would there really be such a coincidental thing in the world?<br>In any case, Chu Feng needed to go and check things out.<br>If that was truly the Little Fishy he knew, Chu Feng would definitely rescue her.<br>Even if he needed to confront a Martial Exalted-level expert, Chu Feng would still have to give it his all.<br></p></div>
