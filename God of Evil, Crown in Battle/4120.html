        <div> - Inside The Blaze Cliff<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chu Feng and the Fumo siblings were right above the blazing cliff.<br>Chu Feng and the Fumo siblings were right above the blazing cliff.<br>As they looked at the rising flames and the bottomless cliff, complicated expressions filled their faces.<br>They were nervous, emotional, excited and feeling expectant.<br>They all knew how dangerous that blazing cliff was.<br>But, they were all looking forward to it.<br>This was especially true for Fumo Shaoyu. The look of anticipation on his face was even more intense than Chu Feng&rsquo;s.<br>To Chu Feng, leaving this place would mean returning to the world he belonged to originally.<br>However, to Fumo Shaoyu, leaving this place would mean that he would enter a wholly new world, the actual vast world of martial cultivators.<br>&ldquo;Lil' sis, you should return,&rdquo; Fumo Shaoyu said to Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, I&rsquo;ve changed my mind. I want to go outside with you,&rdquo; said Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re planning to go outside with me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, didn&rsquo;t you say that you&rsquo;re planning to stay to look after grandma?&rdquo; Fumo Shaoyu looked to Fumo Xin&rsquo;er with surprise.<br>Before this, his little sister had insisted on staying, and had refused to go outside.<br>Even when Fumo Shaoyu had urged his sister to accompany him, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er still insisted on staying.<br>That was also the reason why Fumo Shaoyu was more knowledgeable about how to leave this place compared to Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>After all, Fumo Shaoyu had been searching for a way to leave all on his own.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought about it. Grandma is very healthy still. There&rsquo;s no need for me to look after her.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s better that I go out to check the outside world with you two. When grandma gets older, I will return to accompany her then.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, if you are to run out, I will definitely be scolded by her.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you fail to go out and instead get yourself eaten by an Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast, I will be scolded even more.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since I&rsquo;m going to be scolded either way, it&rsquo;s better that I accompany you two instead,&rdquo; said Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Pah! Stop trying to pull the wool over my eyes. The way I see it, you must have some sort of ulterior motive,&rdquo; as Fumo Shaoyu spoke, he took a glance at Chu Feng.<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s exceptionally beautiful face suddenly turned red. She lowered her head and said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not it. I just want to accompany you. Big brother, stop talking nonsense.&rdquo;<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er also took a glance at Chu Feng as she said those words.<br>That gaze of hers was very unclear.<br>This situation caused Chu Feng to feel somewhat awkward.<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er couldn&rsquo;t possibly have truly fallen for him, right?<br>But, Chu Feng had no feelings for her.<br>If Fumo Xin&rsquo;er had truly fallen for him, it would definitely be an ill-fated relationship destined to bear no fruit.<br>&lsquo;No, I must prevent this sort of thing from happening.&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;I must explicitly tell Fumo Xin&rsquo;er that it&rsquo;s impossible between us.&rsquo;<br>When this thought came to Chu Feng&rsquo;s mind, he tried to say something.<br>He wanted to let Fumo Xin&rsquo;er that she should not develop feelings for him.<br>But, at that moment, Fumo Shaoyu actually waved his arm, grabbed Chu Feng&rsquo;s shoulder and pulled him over.<br>Then, with a proud attitude, he said to Fumo Xin&rsquo;er, &ldquo;Lil' sis, brother Chu Feng is mine. I&rsquo;m planning to marry him. You should not let your imagination run wild.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng&rsquo;s face turned pale. He immediately jumped away from Fumo Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Haha. Brother Chu Feng, I&rsquo;m joking. Look how terrified you became.&rdquo; Fumo Shaoyu burst into laughter.<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er also started to snicker.<br>Fumo Shaoyu&rsquo;s laughing manner really did make it seem like he was joking around.<br>However, when Chu Feng thought about how Fumo Shaoyu was reading that sort of thing, Chu Feng felt that he was abnormal, and involuntarily felt some sort of resistance toward him.<br>&ldquo;Enough messing around. Let&rsquo;s continue with our proper business,&rdquo; said Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>Then, Chu Feng began to set up a spirit formation.<br>Entering the blazing cliff was a dangerous act in and of itself.<br>Thus, to guard against the unexpected, it was better that they be completely prepared.<br>As such, Chu Feng&rsquo;s concealment formation would naturally be indispensable.<br>After the concealment formation was complete, the three of them entered the blazing cliff. They cautiously descended.<br>According to Fumo Shaoyu&rsquo;s investigations, there were three procedures to leaving this world.<br>The first step was the location at the bottom of the blazing cliff. There they would find a special sort of flame fruit.<br>Actually, the first step and third step were pretty simple.<br>The hardest step was the second step.<br>For the second step required them to obtain a scale from an Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast.<br>Just imagine how dangerous it would be to try to retrieve a scale from an Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast?<br>Most importantly, the scale must be retrieved from an Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast inside the blazing cliff. If one were to retrieve a scale outside, it would be useless.<br>Fumo Shaoyu had his own understanding as to why such a thing was demanded.<br>He said that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts in the cliff would have their full power. As such, their scales contained more power.<br>He believed that only this sort of scale would be able to breach the spirit formation and bring them out from that world.<br>As for the third step, it was rather simple.<br>They would first have to turn the scale into armor, and then wear the armor.<br>Then, they were to eat the flame fruit. With that, they could enter the Ancient Era&rsquo;s teleportation formation, and would be able to leave that place.<br>Actually, Fumo Shaoyu had entered the blazing cliff multiple times whilst the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts were not present. As such, he was extremely familiar with it.<br>When they confirmed that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts were not in the blazing cliff, they began to speed up their operations.<br>Under Fumo Shaoyu&rsquo;s guidance, they soon found the so-called flame fruits.<br>It was a sort of fruit that possessed a striking resemblance to a tomato.<br>The so-called flame fruit did not burn with actual flames. It was just that the surface of the fruit had a flame-like pattern.<br>However, the instant Chu Feng saw the flame fruits, he realized why they needed to eat a flame fruit in order to leave the Heaven-devouring Realm.<br>Chu Feng discovered that the flame fruits possessed a boundless amount of spirit power. The spirit power had been gathered into a spirit formation.<br>Chu Feng suspected that the spirit formation would take form in one&rsquo;s body after one swallowed a flame fruit.<br>However, the time should be very limited. Thus, as a safety measure, the three of them plucked all of the flame fruits that they saw.<br>As for the second step, the most crucial and dangerous step, they needed to hide themselves to secretly wait for the return of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts from outside.<br>Then, while the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts were resting, they would remove the scale and escape.<br>Chu Feng set up a concealed teleportation formation at the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast&rsquo;s dwelling.<br>With that teleportation formation, they would be able to teleport out immediately after obtaining the scale.<br>Of course, ordinary teleportation formations wouldn&rsquo;t do. Those were too simple.<br>However, a teleportation formation so concealed and able to avoid the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts&rsquo; detection would be very time-consuming to set up.<br>Even for a world spiritist of Chu Feng&rsquo;s caliber, a total of twenty hours were needed to complete the spirit formation.<br>Furthermore, Chu Feng used many rare materials on it.<br>After all the preparations were completed, Chu Feng and the Fumo siblings hid themselves far away, and quietly waited for the return of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts.<br>The reason why they hid themselves far away and not right at the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts&rsquo; residence was because the Heaven-devouring Beasts were simply too strong.<br>Their strength had reached an inestimable level. Even Fumo Shaoyu and Fumo Xin&rsquo;er, the two siblings that had used their Demon Vanquishing Talismans to suppress the Heaven-devouring Beasts many times in the past, were unable to determine exactly how powerful a Heaven-devouring Beast&rsquo;s full strength was.<br>In a nutshell, according to their grandma, an Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast at full strength was an existence that they absolutely could not defeat.<br>That was also the reason why their grandma insisted that it would be impossible for them to leave the Heaven-devouring Realm.<br>Truth was, she just didn&rsquo;t want them to challenge the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts inside the blazing cliff.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng and the siblings were afraid...<br>They feared that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts could obliterate them with a simple wave of their wings.<br>To guard against the unexpected, it would naturally be more proper for them to hide a bit further away.<br></p></div>
