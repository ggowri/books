        <div> - Speak With Strength<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;What? You all want to participate together? You want to go eleven-on-one against young master Asura, a person of the younger generation?!&rdquo; The Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s elders were all astonished.<br>Facing the crowd&rsquo;s astonished gazes, the Mystic Cave Saints&rsquo; Eldest nodded his head. &ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Truly shameless beyond belief! No matter what, you all are renowned individuals in the All-heaven Starfield. How could you have the nerve to bully a person of the younger generation like this?!&rdquo;<br>The Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s elders were all gnashing their teeth furiously. They wanted to beat the Mystic Cave Saints to death.<br>&ldquo;Lady Headmaster, the reputation of the Mystic Cave Saints is truly not in vain. They are truly shameless without any baseline!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We must not continue gambling with people like them! We should directly drive them out of here!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No, how could we directly drive them out? They snuck their way into the World Spirit Formation Gate by cheating. We should capture them, hand them over to the Seven Suns Mountain Range, and have Grandmaster Yuan Shu handle them.&rdquo;<br>The Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s elders were truly enraged.<br>They no longer wanted to continue with the gamble. Instead, they were thinking about how to punish the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Humph, gamble or not? It&rsquo;s a single word.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re unable to take defeat with grace, then just say it directly instead of threatening us here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Did you really think that we, the Mystic Cave Saints, are so easily bullied?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want to abide by the rules and want to use martial power against us, you can very well give it a try.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Go ahead and see if we, the Mystic Cave Saints, are fish on the chopping block, or a nightmare that your Red-dress Holy Land shouldn&rsquo;t provoke.&rdquo;<br>The Mystic Cave Saints showed no fear towards the threats from the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s elders. Instead, they sneered at them.<br>&ldquo;Young master Asura, are you willing to attempt taking on eleven of them by yourself?&rdquo; The Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster looked to Chu Feng again.<br>She was actually trying to accept the conditions.<br>Her words caused great anxiety for the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s elders.<br>&ldquo;Lady Headmaster, their demands are simply too excessive. We cannot have young master Asura take on such dangers.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lady Headmaster, you mustn&rsquo;t accept their conditions.&rdquo; the elders of the Red-dress Holy Land urged.<br>&ldquo;Quiet!&rdquo;<br>The Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster revealed a look of displeasure.<br>Her shout of &lsquo;quiet&rsquo; was not loud. However, after she said it, the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s elders all shut their mouths.<br>&ldquo;Lady Headmaster, this Asura is willing to give it a try.&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Very well. I&rsquo;ll have to trouble young master Asura then.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster turned her gaze to the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Mystic Cave Saints, we accept your unreasonable demand. If you all dare play any more tricks should we win, do not blame me, Han Xiu, for becoming impolite.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Headmaster Red-dress, you need not worry. We, the Mystic Cave Saints, are honest people with integrity." the Mystic Cave Saints&rsquo; Eldest said with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>The other ten people from the Mystic Cave Saints all soared into the sky and landed on the plaza.<br>At that moment, the eleven people from the Mystic Cave Saints were all standing in the plaza and facing Chu Feng.<br>Seeing this scene, the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s elders were so nervous that their hearts jumped into their throats. Even Yin Zhuanghong, someone who had always been able to keep her calm, had a deeply worried look on her face.<br>After all, those were all of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>Even though the rumors about the Mystic Cave Saints were all rather bad, their strength could not be underestimated.<br>That was something that could be seen by how the weakest of the Mystic Cave Saints, Eleventh, was able to defeat Zhang Duotuo in a single bout.<br>No matter what, Zhang Duotuo was a renowned world spiritist of their Reincarnation Upper Realm.<br>Even though Chu Feng had defeated Eleventh, he had fought him for two entire hours before finally gaining an advantage in battle. It could be said that his victory was not easily obtained.<br>And now, Chu Feng was actually going to take on all eleven of the Mystic Cave Saints by himself.<br>Anyone could tell that the chances of victory for Chu Feng would be very slim.<br>&ldquo;Mystic Cave Saints, are you all prepared?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked all of a sudden.<br>Once Chu Feng said those words, the crowd&rsquo;s expressions all changed.<br>They discovered that Chu Feng showed no trace of fear on his face even though he was facing all of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>Instead, there was a faint smile on his face.<br>That smile was rather strange. It seemed like it contained some sort of conspiracy.<br>&ldquo;Little brat, you&rsquo;re truly arrogant.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Your daddy was not afraid of you even when taking you on alone. And now, all eleven of us brothers are standing here. How could we possibly fear you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I know that you held back when you were fighting against Eleventh. You were trying to conserve your strength and catch us off-guard, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, you&rsquo;ve miscalculated. Your daddy I am not so easily deceived.&rdquo; said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints. He was immensely pleased with himself as he said those words.<br>Hearing those words, the crowd came to a sudden realization.<br>It turned out that Chu Feng had actually concealed his strength. It was because the Mystic Cave Saints&rsquo; Eldest saw through Chu Feng&rsquo;s plan that he had made such a rude request.<br>When the crowd looked to Chu Feng again, they suddenly no longer felt so much despair.<br>Instead, they were rather looking forward to the match. They all wanted to know if Chu Feng had really concealed his true strength like the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints had declared.<br>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the case. No wonder you don&rsquo;t dare to take me on alone. So you were afraid.&rdquo; The smile on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face became increasingly taunting.<br>&ldquo;Afraid? Little brat, if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re thinking, you&rsquo;re gravely mistaken.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Did you really think that your daddy would be afraid of you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What I&rsquo;m doing is called winning with certainty.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Enough, there&rsquo;s no need to continue with these useless superfluous words. Go ahead and unleash your strength. Your daddy also wants to see exactly how much strength you&rsquo;ve concealed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, I might as well tell you this. No matter how much strength you&rsquo;ve concealed, it&rsquo;s all useless, as you will definitely lose today." said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng was unable to keep himself from cursing in his heart at how shameless that old bastard was.<br>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s no need to continue with such useless superfluous words?&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t plan to have me refute you now that you&rsquo;re done speaking?&rsquo;<br>That said, Chu Feng did not refute the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints. After all, he did not wish to spend time arguing with them. He had decided to speak with his strength.<br></p></div>
