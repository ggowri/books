        <h1>Chapter 3955</h1>
        <div> - Before Closed-door Training<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;This item is that powerful?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng became very curious, and started carefully observing the little golden person after hearing how the Mystic Cave Saints described it.<br>The more he observed, the more he could sense how amazing that little golden person was. This thing simply resembled a living body. Within it was housed a boundless amount of martial power.<br>That was Utmost Exalted-level martial power!!!<br>&ldquo;Of course, we&rsquo;ve spent a great amount of energy to obtain this item.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s amazingness might even surpass your imagination.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Activating it, you&rsquo;ll be able to gain the power of a rank four Utmost Exalted temporarily.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, according to our knowledge, the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster and the strongest experts of the other starfields are only rank four Utmost Exalted.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, as long as you activate this item, you will truly be able to battle against the All-heaven Sect and others. I&rsquo;m not boasting at all,&rdquo; said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;I can tell that this item is very powerful,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Although it&rsquo;s very powerful, it&rsquo;s also rather dangerous,&rdquo; said the others of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s dangerous about it?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s identical to a forbidden medicine, and will leave an enormous burden upon the user. Even if the user is an Exalted, they will still suffer an enormous backlash. The backlash might even be fatal. Thus, let&rsquo;s hope that we wouldn&rsquo;t have to end up using this thing,&rdquo; said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, then it&rsquo;ll be best to not use it,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled after hearing the Mystic Cave Saints&rsquo; explanation.<br>Of course, he did not wish for the Mystic Cave Saints to sacrifice their lives to save him.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, you can rest assured. Although our world spirit techniques are inferior to yours, we have a lot of treasures.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With the support of our numerous treasures, the spirit formation we&rsquo;ve set up outside the All-heaven Sect is extremely powerful. Our spirit formation is most definitely able to bring you out safely. Thus, there&rsquo;s simply no need for us to use this thing,&rdquo; guaranteed the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>Then, the Mystic Cave Saints began to place the imprint on Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br>As the Mystic Cave Saints had made their preparations ahead of time, it did not take them a long time to imprint Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br>After the imprint was placed, Chu Feng chatted with the Mystic Cave Saints about their operation. Through their conversation, Chu Feng learned more information.<br>He learned that the other five starfields&rsquo; overlord powers had all arrived at the All-heaven Upper Realm.<br>They were respectively:<br>Miao Heavenly Clan.<br>Dragon Phoenix Immortal Pavilion.<br>Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain.<br>Wind Lightning Sword Sect.<br>Inferno Academy.<br>These five powers all placed great importance on that treasure.<br>Thus, they&rsquo;ve not only dispatched their various experts and top younger generations, but even their leaders, their headmaster-level existences, had arrived.<br>In other words, Chu Feng was not only going to face the All-heaven Sect.<br>He also needed to face five other colossuses on the same level as the All-heaven Sect.<br>Chu Feng also learned a bit about those people of the younger generation from the Mystic Cave Saints. They were not people that he needed to fear in the slightest.<br>Even though those people of the younger generation were all the strongest from their respective starfields, there was an enormous disparity between them and Chu Feng.<br>Ignoring the fact that Chu Feng was about to become a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, merely in terms of cultivation, there was an enormous disparity between him and those younger generations.<br>Thus, it would simply be an effortless task for him to take care of them.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, since it&rsquo;s going to be a couple more days before that grand occasion begins, why don&rsquo;t we go look for some fun?&rdquo; the Eleventh of the Mystic Cave Saints said after the imprinting was complete.<br>&ldquo;What sort of fun?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;The five great powers have all arrived at the All-heaven Sect and are very restless, unable to stay inside the sect. Because of that, people from the five great powers can be seen both inside and outside the All-heaven Sect.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We can disguise ourselves and bully the weak among them. Who knows, we might even be able to find some treasures on them. After all, they&rsquo;re people from the five great powers,&rdquo; said the Eleventh of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;The treasures they have on them couldn&rsquo;t possibly compare to the treasures you all have, no?&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, I knew you weren&rsquo;t someone who knows how to enjoy life.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As the saying goes, although houseflies are small, they&rsquo;re still flesh. Things like riches are accumulated little by little.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right, right, right, that&rsquo;s how it is,&rdquo; the Mystic Cave Saints echoed in succession.<br>&ldquo;You all can go ahead then. I will not be coming. I&rsquo;m going to enter closed-door training,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to enter closed-door training? You&rsquo;re simply too hardworking, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re actually unwilling to let even such a short amount of time slip by?&rdquo;<br>The Mystic Cave Saints felt very surprised. But, at the same time, they were unwilling to give up.<br>Thus, they began to continue to persuade Chu Feng to join them.<br>To the Mystic Cave Saints, what they were going to do was truly amusing. Thus, they wanted Chu Feng to enjoy the pleasures with them.<br>Yet, Chu Feng&rsquo;s attitude remained firm.<br>&ldquo;Enough, enough. Let&rsquo;s not bother brother Asura&rsquo;s training.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You all go and have your fun. Remember, do not expose yourselves,&rdquo; said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, are you not coming with us?&rdquo; asked the Second Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Coming my ass. Did you not hear brother Asura say that he needs to enter closed-door training?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since brother Asura is going to enter closed-door training, I will naturally have to stay to guard him. Otherwise, if some sort of mishap is to happen, what are we to do then? Remember, we&rsquo;re in the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s territory here,&rdquo; said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Right, we nearly forgot. In that case, I&rsquo;m not going either. I&rsquo;ll also stay here to guard brother Asura.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Me too. I&rsquo;ll also stay to guard brother Asura.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going either.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Neither am I.&rdquo;<br>Hearing what the Eldest said, the Mystic Cave Saints actually uniformly decided to stay and guard Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng naturally did not agree to their decision. Although he was loyal to his friends, he was not fond of causing trouble for others.<br>Thus, he wanted the Mystic Cave Saints to continue with what they were interested in doing. He felt that there was no need for them to stay to guard him.<br>However, the Mystic Cave Saints were even more stubborn than Chu Feng.<br>After they made their decision, they refused to change. With this, Chu Feng had no choice but to allow them to stay.<br>On the way there, he had been using treasures to hasten his journey in the Ancient Era&rsquo;s teleportation formation. Thus, he did not have to spend any of his energy.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng had been using the Spirit Spring Water to train while he was traveling in the Ancient Era&rsquo;s teleportation formation. He had made decent progress from that training.<br>The reason why he decided to train even there was because he wanted to make a breakthrough to Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.<br>Not wanting to disturb Chu Feng, the Mystic Cave Saints left the room. They went elsewhere to secretly guard him .<br>That being said, Chu Feng did not immediately begin his training after they left.<br>The reason for that was because there was something that was still puzzling him.<br>He wanted to solve this matter before entering closed-door training.<br>Thus, Chu Feng entered his world spirit space.<br>Two exceptional beauties were training inside his world spirit space.<br>Every time Chu Feng entered his world spirit space, he would be filled with emotions.<br>Whenever he saw Her Lady Queen, who was undergoing training, Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart would tremble.<br>It had been a long time since Her Lady Queen had closed her eyes and begun her training.<br></p></div>
