        <h1>Chapter 3803</h1>
        <div> - World Spirit Mansion Gate<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It turned out that Old Freak Tang was not afflicted with a terminal illness at all.<br>Instead, he was afflicted with a curse.<br>Old Freak Tang had placed a curse upon himself.<br>He had cursed himself to die with his beloved.<br>It was no wonder his condition deteriorated as Song Ge&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s condition deteriorated.<br>It was also no wonder that Old Freak Tang died shortly after Song Ge&rsquo;s mother died.<br>It turned out that it was all deliberately done by Old Freak Tang.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng felt extremely shaken.<br>Song Ge&rsquo;s mother had deeply loved Old Freak Tang. As for Old Freak Tang, he too deeply loved her.<br>Love, he naturally loved her. If he only felt guilty and ashamed, he would not have gone so far.<br>Even though Old Freak Tang and Song Ge&rsquo;s mother did not say a single word to each other throughout all those years, they had deeply loved one another.<br>Even though Old Freak Tang appeared to have never accompanied Song Ge&rsquo;s mother, he had been silently accompanying her the entire time.<br>Even towards death, something that the great majority of people feared, Old Freak Tang showed no sign of cowardice, and decided to accompany his beloved into death.<br>This was true love!!!<br>&hellip;&hellip;<br>The following day. Chu Feng bade his farewell to Song Ge.<br>That said, Chu Feng did not go far away after bidding his farewell.<br>The reason for that was because when seven suns were present on the Seven Suns Mountain Range, the entrance to the Seven Suns Mountain Range would finally open.<br>Compared to when he'd first arrived, Chu Feng&rsquo;s frame of mind had changed enormously.<br>In a mere five short days, he'd witnessed a family&rsquo;s departing journey of love and regret.<br>Chu Feng felt extremely moved by it. He also started having a whole new level of awareness toward the world. In fact, he even held a new view toward the path of martial cultivation.He felt&hellip; a trace of an opportunity to make a breakthrough.<br>After the Seven Suns Mountain Range&rsquo;s entrance gate opened, everyone lined up to climb the mountain. Chu Feng was no exception.<br>However, Chu Feng&rsquo;s purpose differed from the rest of the crowd.<br>The others were ascending the mountain for the rich natural energy it contained.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s goal was not that. His goal was to see the master of the Seven Suns Mountain Range, Yuan Shu.<br>To Chu Feng&rsquo;s surprise, although the Seven Suns Mountain Range had opened up, Yuan Shu was still in closed-door training. The guards of the Seven Suns Mountain Range had no idea when he would come out of his closed-door training.<br>This greatly disappointed Chu Feng.<br>He had waited so many days in vain. He couldn&rsquo;t possibly continue to wait there until Yuan Shu exited his closed-door training.<br>As Chu Feng pondered, he began to descend the mountain.<br>&ldquo;Senior Asura.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly a series of shouts could be heard.<br>Chu Feng raised his head, and discovered that it was actually Yang Shenshen and her father, the Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster. Of course, others from the Watermirror Paradise were accompanying them. This included Miao Yu&rsquo;s grandfather.<br>&ldquo;What a coincidence. You all must&rsquo;ve come here to train, right?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Senior Asura, you must&rsquo;ve come here to train too, right?&rdquo; asked Yang Shenshen.<br>&ldquo;You can say that,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;But, the training location is up there. Why is senior going down the mountain?&rdquo; asked Yang Shenshen.<br>&ldquo;I feel that this place will not provide much assistance to me. Thus, I don't plan to train here,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>As there were a lot of people on the mountain, Chu Feng&rsquo;s words immediately caught countless gazes from the surrounding crowd.<br>There were mocking gazes, people rolling their eyes, and even furious gazes.<br>Yang Shenshen arrived beside Chu Feng and said to him using voice transmission, &ldquo;Senior, you must not say that sort of thing. The people here have all come for the natural energies here. If you say something like that, you&rsquo;ll end up angering them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I understand. I misspoke.&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled.<br>Chu Feng naturally understood Yang Shenshen&rsquo;s intention. He also understood how those people felt.<br>Countless people were lined up waiting for a banquet to arrive. They were looking forward to it so much that they declared the banquet to be the best in the entire world.<br>However, when everyone was enjoying the banquet with wild joy, someone suddenly declared that there was nothing great about the banquet. Naturally, that person would be met with displeasure from the people enjoying the banquet.<br>Furthermore, what that person declared was akin to negating everyone&rsquo;s taste and aesthetics.<br>&ldquo;Strange. I&rsquo;m not the only one uninterested in cultivating up there. Aren&rsquo;t those people also staying there and not ascending the mountain?&rdquo; Chu Feng pointed to some people nearby.<br>There was an enormous plaza there. There were a lot of people gathered atop that plaza. From a glance, there were at least several tens of thousands.<br>Furthermore, the number of people on that plaza was still increasing.<br>&ldquo;Senior, they are waiting for the opening of the World Spirit Mansion Gate," said Yang Shenshen.<br>&ldquo;World Spirit Mansion Gate? What is that?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;The World Spirit Mansion Gate is a beneficial gift deliberately prepared for world spiritists.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Inside the World Spirit Mansion Gate are a lot of treasures beneficial to world spirits and world spiritists.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The World Spirit Mansion Gate opens once every year. Because of that, many people did not come for the sake of cultivating. Instead, they came for the World Spirit Mansion Gate.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, you&rsquo;re also a world spiritist. You can go ahead and sense it. Those people are all filled with abundant spirit power. They&rsquo;re all world spiritists," said Yang Shenshen.<br>&ldquo;Now that you mention it.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had already noticed those people were all world spiritists.<br>Not only that, but he had also discovered that those world spiritists were all people of the younger generation, less than a hundred years old.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, an enormous spirit formation gate appeared in the center of the plaza.<br>Once that spirit formation gate appeared, the world spiritists on the plaza began to leap into the spirit formation gate.<br>Once the spirit formation gate appeared, Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze was immediately captured by it.<br>The reason for that was because the spirit power behind that spirit formation gate was extremely powerful. Although Chu Feng was unable to tell what level it was, it was definitely not simply Dragon Mark Saint-level.<br>&ldquo;Sure enough, that Yuan Shu is more than just a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist. He has indeed concealed his strength.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt secretly delighted. Even though he had made guesses in the past, he now felt even more certain of his guess after seeing the spirit formation gate.<br>&ldquo;Girl, are you interested in that World Spirit Mansion Gate?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>He was asking the world spirit in his body, Yu Sha.<br>&ldquo;Whatever,&rdquo; Yu Sha said coldly.<br>&ldquo;This girl. We&rsquo;ve known each other for so long already, yet you&rsquo;re still so cold?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, since you said whatever, I&rsquo;ll make the decision. Let us go in and have a look.&rdquo;<br>After making his decision, Chu Feng immediately started walking towards the World Spirit Mansion Gate.<br>Seeing that, Yang Shenshen and the others followed him.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? Are you all also interested in that World Spirit Mansion Gate?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;No. We merely wanted to accompany senior and have a look,&rdquo; said Yang Shenshen.<br>&ldquo;Right, right, right.&rdquo; Yang Shenshen&rsquo;s grandfather nodded repeatedly.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s boring to look from outside. Let&rsquo;s go in and have a look,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Senior Asura, please wait.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re implying that you want to enter the World Spirit Mansion Gate?&rdquo; asked Yang Shenshen.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng with confusion.<br>&ldquo;Senior Asura, perhaps you don&rsquo;t understand this place. However, that World Spirit Mansion Gate actually has a restriction. Only people of the younger generation within a hundred years of age are able to enter it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, they must be world spiritists. The reason for that is because one will not be able to use any martial power after entering the World Spirit Mansion Gate. The only power that one can use are world spirit techniques," said Yang Shenshen.<br></p></div>
