        <h1>Chapter 1322</h1>
        <div> - I Insist On Taking His Life<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>&ldquo;Bastard, I&rsquo;ll kill you.&rdquo;<br>Having his chest pierced through by Chu Feng, Jiang Wuyi entered a state of incomparable fury.<br>Although the pain to his physical body might not amount to much to him, to be injured before all these people was, to him, the grand number one disciple of the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest, an enormous disgrace; an act that caused him to lose all face.<br>He had to seize back the face he had lost. As for that, there was only a single way for him to do that. That was, to turn the tide and slaughter Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Woosh.&rdquo;<br>Thinking up to this point, he endured the pain of having his chest pierced through, released the long Royal Armament sword in his hand and instead began to control it with his thoughts. The Royal Armament sword turned around and, as it flickered with metallic shine, thrust toward Chu Feng&rsquo;s throat. Jiang Wuyi was trying to slice Chu Feng&rsquo;s head off.<br>&ldquo;Pow.&rdquo;<br>However, right at the moment when that large Royal Armament sword was about to land on Chu Feng&rsquo;s throat, Chu Feng made an astonishing action.<br>Chu Feng extended his other hand and lightly grabbed it. With merely that simple action, he grabbed onto Jiang Wuyi&rsquo;s large Royal Armament sword and completely seized it.<br>&ldquo;So you actually want to be killed by your own Royal Armament?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Very well, I&rsquo;ll help you.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng smiled indifferently. Then, he grabbed onto that large Royal Armament sword and abruptly turned around. With a &lsquo;puu&rsquo; sound, that large Royal Armament sword was pierced into Jiang Wuyi&rsquo;s dantian.<br>&ldquo;Ahhh~~~~~~~&rdquo;<br>With his dantian damaged, Jiang Wuyi was instantly stunned. He started to panic and began to let out miserable sounding screams.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, stop right now. You must not kill Jiang Wuyi!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Bastard, do you know what Jiang Wuyi is? He is the blood grandson of the Colorful Bamboo Forest&rsquo;s management elder, Elder Jiang!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you, a mere nominal disciple of the Discarded Bamboo Forest, dare to do anything to him, our entire Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest will not let you get away with it!&rdquo;<br>At this time, the elders present were all deeply frightened. At the same time, they started to berate Chu Feng. They even began to speak of Jiang Wuyi&rsquo;s origins and what powerful backer he possessed to try to oppress Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What, since he can&rsquo;t win against me, you&rsquo;re trying to use his origins to oppress me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You elders from the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest, do you even know the word shame?&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered.<br>Suddenly, a loud angry shout sounded. At the same time, a very powerful and oppressive might swept through this area, &ldquo;Chu Feng, if you dare to touch my grandson, this old man will dismember your body into ten thousand pieces today!&rdquo;<br>Turning their heads to look, the crowd saw that numerous figures were flying over. They were all people from the Colorful Bamboo Forest. Merely, they were not disciples. Instead, they were the Colorful Bamboo Forest&rsquo;s elders.<br>The cultivations of these elders were not to be looked down upon. The majority of them were all Half Martial Emperors. Especially the person who led them, whos cultivation was unfathomable.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Jiang Wuyi&rsquo;s grandfather, Elder Jiang.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng is toast this time around. Jiang Wuyi is Elder Jiang&rsquo;s beloved grandson, someone that he endlessly pampered. Now that Jiang Wuyi&rsquo;s dantian has been pierced by Chu Feng and his cultivation is about to be crippled, Elder Jiang will definitely not let Chu Feng get away with it.&rdquo;<br>Once this old man appeared, cries of alarm and surprise began to sound from the crowd repeatedly. There were even many people who began to sweat cold bullets for Chu Feng.[1. As in, they were worried about his safety.] That was because the elder who led the group of elders from the Colorful Bamboo Forest was Jiang Wuyi&rsquo;s blood grandfather, Jiang Chenshan.<br>&ldquo;Grandfather, save me~~~~~&rdquo; When he saw his grandfather&rsquo;s appearance, Jiang Wuyi stopped trying to forcefully endure and actually emitted a miserable cry for help.<br>&ldquo;You are Jiang Wuyi&rsquo;s grandfather?&rdquo; As for Chu Feng, he had a smile on his face and asked the question that he already knew the answer to.<br>&ldquo;You animal!&rdquo; Seeing that Chu Feng was not only fearless when seeing him and actually asked a question with an answer that he already knew; then when he saw that his grandson&rsquo;s cultivation was rapidly dropping, Jiang Chenshan was utterly enraged. He gnashed down on his teeth and angrily shouted. He was planning to attack Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you act, or else your grandson&rsquo;s life might be lost.&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, Chu Feng abruptly pulled out his arm that had pierced into Jiang Wuyi&rsquo;s chest, causing him to scream in pain.<br>Seeing this, Jiang Chenshan did not dare to act blindly without thinking. Thus, he asked, &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not much, I merely wish to show you something.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng smiled coldly. After that, he placed the hand that he had just pulled out of Jiang Wuyi&rsquo;s chest into his bosom and took out the Life and Death Agreement. Furthermore, before everyone&rsquo;s eyes, he opened it.<br>&ldquo;Open your dog eyes and look carefully. This is the Life and Death Agreement signed by both Jiang Wuyi and I.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As the saying goes, if you agree to a bet, you must accept the loss. Regardless of whether he has the ability or not, it remains that he signed the Life and Death Agreement. Thus, he must accept the consequences of his own conduct.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today, I do not care whose grandson this Jiang Wuyi might be, even if his grandfather is the Heavenly Emperor [1.God.] himself, I will still insist on taking his life.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke to this point, he tightened his grip on the long Royal Armament Sword pierced into Jiang Wuyi&rsquo;s dantian. Then, he suddenly put power into it. As a flash of blood shone through in a perfectly straight line, Jiang Wuyi was split into two by Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Heavens, this&hellip;&rdquo;<br>As they saw the body that had been split into two and the blood that was sprinkling down from the sky, everyone was stunned.<br>Especially the disciples; their eyes and mouths were wide open, as if they had been petrified.<br>Practically no one expected that Chu Feng would actually dare to kill Jiang Wuyi.<br>More than that, no one ever would have imagined that not only did Chu Feng kill Jiang Wuyi, he even split Jiang Wuyi into two before his own grandfather, not even leaving his corpse intact.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; you&hellip; you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Seeing his grandson being ruthlessly killed by being split in half before his very eyes, Jiang Chenshan was completely stunned. He was so enraged that his body began to tremble, and he was unable to even speak properly. It was evident that he had received an enormous shock.<br>&ldquo;Kill this animal!!!!&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, an elder from the army of Colorful Bamboo Forest&rsquo;s elders shouted those words.<br>Immediately afterward, other than Jiang Chenshan, all of the elders from the Colorful Bamboo Forest began to charge forward, surrounding Chu Feng and attacking him.<br>&ldquo;Kill Chu Feng, avenge Jiang Wuyi!&rdquo;<br>Seeing this, the elders from the Golden Bamboo Forest, Silver Bamboo Forest, Copper Bamboo Forest and Iron Bamboo Forest that hated Chu Feng took this opportunity to join the army that was charging toward Chu Feng and began to unleash fatal attacks toward him.<br>&ldquo;You wish to kill me? That depends on whether or not you have the ability.&rdquo;<br>Faced with the aged figures who surrounded him from all sides, Chu Feng snorted coldly. Then, with a flip of his wrist, the Demon Sealing Sword appeared in his hand.<br>The movements of his feet also changed. He had activated the Mortal Taboo: Illusion Light Technique.<br>In an instant, Chu Feng&rsquo;s speed became as fast as the light, surpassing even lightning. Not only did he dodge the numerous incoming attacks, he even managed to shuttle between the inescapable blockade set up by the elders with ease.<br>Not only were the Martial King-level elders from the Golden, Silver, Copper and Iron Bamboo Forests incapable of catching Chu Feng, even the Half Martial Emperor-level elders from the Colorful Bamboo Forest were unable to catch him.<br>&ldquo;Too amazing, even Half Martial Emperor-level experts are unable to catch this Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Exactly who is he? How could he be this frightening?&rdquo;<br>Although he was surrounded by elders, Chu Feng chose not to escape, and instead used an ingenious movement martial skill to play around with the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest&rsquo;s elders like a monkey in midair.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you damned animal, this old man will skin you alive, pull out your tendons, hack your body a thousand times and then dismember it into ten thousand pieces!!!!&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, that Jiang Chenshan suddenly snarled. Immediately afterward, he waved his sleeve, and a boundlessly powerful martial power swept forth toward Chu Feng to oppress him.<br>He had finally attacked. Furthermore, his attack was no small matter either. Chu Feng was unable to determine what sort of cultivation Jiang Chenshan possessed. However, he knew for certain that he was no match for him.<br>~Rumble.<br>However, right at the moment when everyone felt that a great catastrophe was about to befall Chu Feng, Jiang Chenshan&rsquo;s attack suddenly exploded, and then instantly disappeared into thin air. It was as if the attack had never appeared.<br>Right at the moment when everyone was stunned as to what exactly had happened, an aged figure appeared before Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I shall see who exactly dares to touch my Discarded Bamboo Forest&rsquo;s disciple today.&rdquo;<br></p></div>
