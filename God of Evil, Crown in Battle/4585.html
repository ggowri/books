        <div>: The Mysterious Elder<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Failed? Does it mean that I have made a wasted trip?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a tight frown.<br>&ldquo;You can take it that way, but it&rsquo;s not entirely so either.&rdquo;<br>As Daoist Niantian said those words, he flung his sleeves grandly. The beautiful world immediately began trembling in response to his movements.<br>In just the blink of an eye, Chu Feng was evicted from the world, and his consciousness returned back to his physical body. However, Daoist Niantian was still standing right before him.<br>Chu Feng took a look at his body once more and found that his Niantian Energy had disappeared without a trace.<br>&ldquo;Elder, even if I have failed your trial, surely it doesn&rsquo;t warrant you taking away all of the Niantian Energy, right? You should at least leave some for me. After all, I did win that fair and square through the Niantian Gambling Formation,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>The ones who obtained the Niantian Energy weren't just Chu Feng but many other people, including Long Xiaoxiao, Yu Lie, and the others. They immediately cultivated on the spot, and while it didn&rsquo;t raise their cultivation level, it did build up the foundations required for them to make a breakthrough in the future.<br>Chu Feng had obtained the most Niantian Energy, but ironically, he found himself unable to use it at all. He thought that he would be able to obtain greater rewards as long as he successfully breached the formation. So, he did it and found the destination located on the map, spending a great amount of effort and time on that.<br>Yet, it all turned out to be a futile trip.<br>Not only did he not receive any rewards, but he even got the Niantian Energy that originally belonged to him taken away.<br>&ldquo;This is the price of failure,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian said.<br>&ldquo;Elder, isn&rsquo;t it unfair? The Niantian Energy was already a formation when it entered my body. I couldn&rsquo;t tap into any of it all this while. It was so that I could use the Niantian Energy to cultivate that I did my best to breach the formation and sought the destination on the map.<br>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that it was a challenge, and I was forced to go along with it. I was given no choice here,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a wronged voice.<br>&ldquo;I only have the same few words for you. This is the price of failure. Young friend Chu Feng, you have superior talent, and there&rsquo;s no need for you to rush into things. Perhaps, you might succeed the next time around. As long as you clear my challenge, I guarantee that you&rsquo;ll be able to obtain what you seek,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Elder, why don&rsquo;t we do this right now? Allow me to challenge your trial once more,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>He didn&rsquo;t want to miss this golden opportunity to become stronger.<br>He knew that Daoist Niantian was an elusive figure, and there was a good chance that he might never see the latter anymore once they parted. If so, he would have wasted a good opportunity!<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, haste makes waste. When the time is ripe, I&rsquo;ll bestow you with another opportunity. It won&rsquo;t work for you now,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian said.<br>&ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the case, elder, can you tell me what rewards will I obtain if I clear the trial?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;If you clear the trial, you&rsquo;ll be able to obtain the purest Niantian Energy. It&rsquo;ll help you greatly in your cultivation.<br>&ldquo;I can tell you frankly that even if you obtain the purest Niantian Energy right now, you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to use it. It&rsquo;ll only be most effective when your cultivation grows to a certain point,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian said.<br>Those words slightly alleviated the stifled feeling in Chu Feng&rsquo;s chest.<br>&ldquo;Elder, can you tell me where you live, or where I could look for you? Also, may I know what cultivation level I have to reach in order to challenge the trial once more? I&rsquo;ll look for you once I reach the required level.&rdquo; Chu Feng took the initiative to ask.<br>He might have failed this time around, but he was determined to make it work the next time.<br>He did have great trust in Daoist Niantian&rsquo;s judgment and capability. Without a doubt, the purest Niantian Energy would be an invaluable help to him in the future.<br>&ldquo;No rush, Chu Feng. We&rsquo;ll see one another when fate decrees,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian said.<br>Of course, Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t satisfied with such an answer. He was planning on arguing a bit more to get his way. Yet, before Chu Feng could say anything at all, Daoist Niantian had already spoken up once more.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one more thing that I should probably tell you. Are Chu Lingxi and Gu Mingyuan important to you?&rdquo;<br>Those words made Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart squeeze a little as he realized that something had gone wrong. He immediately replied, &ldquo;Gu Mingyuan is my elder, and Chu Lingxi is someone very close to me. Elder, why are you asking this?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You have offended the Holy Light Clan. Since they weren&rsquo;t able to find you, they chose to capture Gu Mingyuan and Chu Lingxi instead,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian replied.<br>&ldquo;Elder, is that true?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked anxiously.<br>&ldquo;The Holy Light Clan has indeed captured Gu Mingyuan and Chu Lingxi. They have also declared to the world that if you don&rsquo;t turn yourself in at the Storm Realm within a month&rsquo;s time, they will execute the two of them.<br>&ldquo;And it would seem that the two of them are only the start. If you don&rsquo;t go, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before all the people you know are implicated by your actions,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian said.<br>&ldquo;Are the two of them currently at the Storm Realm?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian replied.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll meet again when fate permits then.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng clasped his fist and quickly dashed out from the ground. He darted into the sky and further into the distance. His destination was, naturally, the teleportation formation.<br>There was no way Chu Feng could allow Chu Lingxi and Gu Mingyuan to die for him&hellip;<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a person who values his relationships, and he has successfully breached your formation. It looks like this child has caught your eye, Niantian. Are you intending to take him in as your disciple?&rdquo;<br>Shortly after Chu Feng left, a voice sounded beside Daoist Niantian.<br>Following that, the surrounding space suddenly jolted, and a silhouette appeared by Daoist Niantian&rsquo;s side.<br>It was a tall but extremely skinny old man. He had hair as white as snow, and a long beard that reached down to his knees. From his prim and proper look, it was apparent that he was someone who paid great importance to his appearance.<br>However, one thing worthy of mention was that this old man had an attire that would surely astonish Chu Feng. Chu Feng might not recognize the old man, but he would surely recognize the clothes he was wearing.<br></p></div>
