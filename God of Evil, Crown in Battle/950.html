        <h1>Chapter 950</h1>
        <div> - The Wind Blows<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>Within a certain underground palace inside the Depraved Ravine, Chu Feng was cultivating in seclusion. However, his goal was not to increase his strength. Instead, it was to completely bring out the power of the Demon Sealing Sword.<br>His cultivation method was very simple&mdash;creating a formation on his own palm.<br>The Demon Sealing Sword was the same as the Silver Dragon Spear and the Asura Ghost Axe&mdash;they had already recognized Chu Feng as their master. Their lives were connected with Chu Feng, and they would move in accordance with his will. They could be brought out from his body, and stored within his body before he had the need to use them.<br>This was the reason for the formation on his right hand. So long as the imprint was successful, he could freely distribute the power of the Demon Sealing Sword to the members of the Crippling Night Demon Sect when the sword was within his grasp.<br>Which also meant the formation was in Chu Feng&rsquo;s complete control. He could give the power to whoever he wanted to; he would give it to anyone in the Crippling Night Demon Sect. Similarly, he could allot it amongst everyone, he could allot it to an individual, and he could also allot it to certain groups.<br>&ldquo;It should be about ready.&rdquo;<br>Finally, after the final stroke, a seemingly insignificant but very profound formation appeared on Chu Feng&rsquo;s palm. It was barely noticeable, and was quite mystical.<br>&ldquo;Haha, Chu Feng, not bad! You&rsquo;re truly quite capable&mdash;you truly figured that formation out! If you ask me, the power this formation contains is even greater than that Demon Bestowal Slaughtering Formation!<br>&ldquo;When you activate it, there will be an essential change everyone&rsquo;s strength. Actually, the ordinary ones don&rsquo;t matter much, but the assistance this provides to Martial Kings like Qiu Canfeng is the most important. After all, they&rsquo;re the ones who supply the most powerful strength in the war.&rdquo;<br>The queen Eggy couldn&rsquo;t help but praise Chu Feng when his formation finally succeeded.<br>In the past few days, she had always stayed by Chu Feng&rsquo;s side. She had watched as Chu Feng reached this stage from absolutely nothing. She saw his entire progress as he studied the Demon Bestowal Slaughtering Formation. She had personally seen how Chu Feng brought out his ability in Spirit Formation techniques.<br>&ldquo;Heh, since I&rsquo;m such a genius, should you consider marrying me?&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Sure! If you don&rsquo;t mind me tearing your thing off on the night of marriage, you can go ahead and try!&rdquo; Eggy said with a smirk as she placed her hands on her waist.<br>&ldquo;Eh&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng was quite speechless. He knew she was not a person who could be so easily teased.<br>*hmm*<br>In the same moment, Chu Feng saw the entrance&rsquo;s formation flicker slightly. It meant someone was looking for him.<br>Chu Feng hurriedly opened the door, and three familiar people entered: Xuan Xiaochao, You Tonghan, and Fu Fengming.<br>&ldquo;We greet Lord Sect Head.&rdquo; The three smiled and bowed together, paying their respects.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t the first time they came to see Chu Feng in the past few days. Chu Feng had also suggested, when there wasn&rsquo;t anyone else, there was no need to call him &ldquo;sect head&rdquo; here and &ldquo;sect head&rdquo; there&mdash;they could just call him Chu Feng. However, that did nothing as they were unwilling to change.<br>In the end, Chu Feng did compromise. They could call him whatever they wanted to; he wouldn&rsquo;t care. In any case, they were still his brothers in his heart.<br>Chu Feng had finished creating the formation, so he was naturally happy after seeing the three of them. He quickly said, &ldquo;Brothers, stand still!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng hurriedly closed the door, then had them stand orderly in a line. Before letting them say anything, a light shone from his palm, then the Demon Sealing Sword appeared within his right hand.<br>When the sword appeared, there was no diminishing in the light that originated from Chu Feng&rsquo;s right hand, and instead, continued emitting a faint radiance. Simultaneously, an invisible shock wave passed through Xuan Xiaochao and the others. Their eyes lit up, and their expressions changed greatly.<br>&ldquo;My gods! Lord Sect Head, you&rsquo;ve succeeded? You&rsquo;ve successfully transferred the Demon Bestowal Slaughtering Formation onto your hand?&rdquo; they exclaimed uncontrollably. The three of them could feel their auras rising. It gave them even more power than the original formation.<br>It meant Chu Feng had truly succeeded. He not only grasped the power of the Demon Sealing Sword, he could even give them its strength.<br>&ldquo;Heh, it seems that it works.&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled and nodded.<br>&ldquo;Haha, this is great! Lord Sect Head, I truly prostrate myself in admiration! It&rsquo;s said the former sect head had thought of something like this too, and he had also attempted doing it, but he hadn&rsquo;t succeeded.<br>&ldquo;I just didn&rsquo;t expect the thing he failed would be completed by you!&rdquo; You Tonghan laughed livelily. He felt joy arise from the bottom of his heart.<br>&ldquo;Yeah! With this, if we truly start fighting the Immortal Execution Archipelago, we&rsquo;ll gain a greater chance at victory!&rdquo; Even Fu Fengming who was usually composed nodded excitedly.<br>Chu Feng naturally understood the reasoning for their intense reactions. Was he himself not very excited as well?<br>He was now the head of the Crippling Night Demon Sect, so finally, he had truly granted the Crippling Night Demon Sect a small favour.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Brothers, you would never look for me needlessly. What&rsquo;s the matter today? Have the preparations for battle all been set up?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a smile.<br>Although Xuan Xiaochao and the others had quite a good relationship with Chu Feng, they would not visit without cause. Every time they came to find Chu Feng was to update him on their current status.<br>In the past few days, Chu Feng had been studying the Demon Bestowal Slaughtering Formation in seclusion. He became a boss who threw all responsibilities to others as he handed everything to Qiu Canfeng.<br>However, Qiu Canfeng was after all the Great Protector of the Crippling Night Demon Sect. He easily managed everyone without any trouble at all. He had also been planning the attack on the Immortal Execution Archipelago.<br>&ldquo;Mm. Under Senior Qiu Canfeng&rsquo;s arrangements, everything is prepared. With an order, the Crippling Night Demon Sect&rsquo;s army of ten million can head out on conquest at any moment.<br>&ldquo;However, we haven&rsquo;t come here today for this. There&rsquo;s an important guest who&rsquo;s come,&rdquo; Xuan Xiaochao said.<br>&ldquo;Important guest?&rdquo; Chu Feng was taken aback.<br>&ldquo;The Immortal Execution Archipelago&rsquo;s First Immortal,&rdquo; Xuan Xiaochao said in a low voice.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes lit up when he learnt it was the First Immortal. A hint of surprise surfaced into his eyes, and without another word, he opened the palace&rsquo;s doors, and stepped outside.<br>Right now, all things were prepared. They just lacked the wind to blow them forth.<br>The First Immortal was the wind they all waited for.<br></p></div>
