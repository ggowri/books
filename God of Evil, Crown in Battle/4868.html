        <h1>Chapter 4867</h1>
        <div>: Outside the City Gate<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everything else proceeded smoothly.<br>The Holy Light Clan&rsquo;s humble wedding procession traversed across the massive galaxy and finally arrived in the Holy Light Clan&rsquo;s base.<br>It was just that Chu Feng had snuck Long Xiaoxiao and her mother out of the carriage in advance and changed their appearances.<br>While they said that they would fight alongside one another, the truth was that Long Xiaoxiao and her mother stood no chance against the Holy Light Clan at all. To be safe, Chu Feng decided to station the two of them at a place far away from the battlefield. They would be disguised as outsiders so that they could watch the battle from afar.<br>It just so happened that the powerhouses coming from all over the Holy Light Galaxy had already arrived in the Holy Light Clan&rsquo;s base, so it wasn&rsquo;t too difficult for them to blend in with the crowd.<br>No one would notice them.<br>Long Xiaoxiao was naturally reluctant to part ways with Chu Feng, but she didn&rsquo;t want to drag him down either. So, she accepted Chu Feng&rsquo;s suggestion.<br>Once everything was settled, Chu Feng killed off one of the clan members of the Holy Light Clan and assumed his identity, becoming one of the members of the wedding procession.<br>As they slowly approached the main city of the Holy Light Clan, Chu Feng felt his blood racing through his body.<br>The Holy Light Clan was the overlords of this galaxy, towering loftily over others. But now, Chu Feng was seeking to challenge their position.<br>This wasn&rsquo;t just to resolve the grudge between him and Shengguang Xuanye but to leave a footprint on the path he had trod on thus far.<br>Today, he was determined to pull the Holy Light Clan down from its high horse in front of the powerhouses of the Holy Light Galaxy!<br>They would become no more than a stepping stone to Chu Feng!<br>&hellip;<br>While the Holy Light Clan had invited the powerhouses of the Holy Light Clan to the wedding ceremony, the ceremony was not held in the main city but a clearing outside the main city.<br>To be honest, it did seem insincere to host such esteemed guests in a place like this, but who would dare to voice any objections to the Holy Light Clan&rsquo;s decision?<br>They even had to put on happy faces, as if it was a huge honor for them to be invited to the wedding ceremony.<br>No one dared to say anything on the surface, but many of the attendees were already gossiping with one another over this matter, such as those from the Yu Heavenly Clan and the Monstrous Herd Temple.<br>Those two powers were second only to the Holy Light Clan in the Holy Light Galaxy, and they happened to be stationed right next to one another.<br>&ldquo;Ey, it really is a pity for Long Xiaoxiao. Haaa! I wonder where young friend Chu Feng is. He&rsquo;ll be heartbroken if he finds out about Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s plight!&rdquo; the sectmaster of the Monstrous Herd Temple told the Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief through voice transmission.<br>He was previously on bad terms with the Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, but after meeting Chu Feng and going through several tribulations, their relationship improved significantly.<br>&ldquo;I heard the rumors too. Princess Xiaoxiao refused to marry Shengguang Yu due to young friend Chu Feng, even going as far as to disfigure herself. Her action angered the Holy Light Clan, prompting them to force her to marry Shengguang Jiahao instead.<br>&ldquo;It seems like Shengguang Jiahao is mentally challenged, so such an act is indubitably an act of sullying Princess Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s reputation. Yet, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief actually agreed to it. I really don&rsquo;t understand what&rsquo;s going through his mind.&rdquo;<br>The Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief also expressed his regret too.<br>&ldquo;What else could he possibly be thinking? He has always been a coward! If my daughter were to be treated in such a way, I&rsquo;d surely do everything I can to fight against the Holy Light Clan. Even if we can&rsquo;t defeat them, surely we can at least run away from them, right?&rdquo; the Monstrous Herd Temple sneered in disdain.<br>&ldquo;In any case, the Holy Light Clan&rsquo;s actions have thoroughly offended young friend Chu Feng this time around. Given young friend Chu Feng&rsquo;s personality, there&rsquo;s no way he&rsquo;ll let things rest.<br>&ldquo;The Holy Light Clan has really gotten too arrogant. Even after suffering a setback in young friend Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand, they still haven&rsquo;t learned their lesson yet! Given sufficient time, young friend Chu Feng will surely march into the Holy Light Clan and end their lineage!&rdquo; the Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;I hope I won&rsquo;t have to wait long for that day to come. I&rsquo;ve had enough of the Holy Light Clan&rsquo;s oppression. Young friend Chu Feng is the Holy Light Galaxy&rsquo;s only hope of rising through the ranks,&rdquo; the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster said expectantly.<br>Woosh!<br>A huge commotion suddenly broke out amongst the crowd. Everyone&rsquo;s eyes turned toward the northwest.<br>The Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster and Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief quickly did the same too.<br>&ldquo;Are they here?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s weird. Did the Holy Light Clan only dispatch these few people for the wedding procession?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I-is that Shengguang Jiahao?&rdquo;<br>The crowd was shocked at just how humble the wedding procession was and Shengguang Jiahoa&rsquo;s appearance. They had known beforehand that this was not a real wedding ceremony but a farce to humiliate Long Xiaoxiao, but still, they didn&rsquo;t expect the Holy Light Clan to go this far.<br>This contrast was made even more so by how the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was leading the elders of the Dragon Clan behind the wedding procession, as if saying that the entire Dragon Clan was only worth this much.<br>&ldquo;The Dragon Clan has completely soiled their reputation today,&rdquo; the Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief spoke lamentably.<br>&ldquo;He was the one who landed himself in this plight. Serves him right,&rdquo; the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster scoffed in contempt.<br>&ldquo;Cough cough!&rdquo;<br>A series of light coughs suddenly echoed from the main city, drawing the crowd&rsquo;s attention over. They quickly rose to their feet and bowed deeply.<br>&ldquo;Paying respects to Lord Xuanye!&rdquo;<br>The crowd greeted Shengguang Xuanye thunderously.<br>A group of elites from the Holy Light Clan was imposingly marching out of the city gates, and the one leading them was the Holy Light Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Shengguang Xuanye.<br>&ldquo;Spare with the ceremonies. You are all guests of our Holy Light Clan today. Do have a seat,&rdquo; Shengguang Xuanye said with a smile.<br>The crowd quickly settled back in their seats. Every word from Shengguang Xuanye was as good as an order, and they had no choice but to do his bidding.<br>Even the hot-tempered Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster also turned a little hypocritical in front of Shengguang Xuanye.<br>By then, the wedding procession led by Shengguang Jiahao and the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had already arrived before the city gate, but it came to a stop some distance before the city gates.<br></p></div>
