        <h1>Chapter 4974</h1>
        <div>: Song Yun and Song Xue&rsquo;er<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The first time Chu Feng met Song Yun was at the Conquerstar Mountain Villa.<br>Song Yun had a tragic history. A Netherworld Envoy of the Netherworld Sect had planted poison into her body at a young age, but she was able to survive thanks to the efforts of her older sister.<br>And Chu Feng did meet Song Yun&rsquo;s older sister back at the Conquerstar Mountain Villa, Song Xue&rsquo;er.<br>Song Xue&rsquo;er appeared to harbor enmity toward Chu Feng when they first met, viewing him as an enemy. However, Chu Feng clearly remembered that it was their first meeting, so there shouldn&rsquo;t be any enmity between them. Thus, he couldn&rsquo;t comprehend where Song Xue&rsquo;er&rsquo;s hostility was coming from.<br>However, he finally got it now.<br>If Song Yun was the daughter of the Godwish Grandmother, her &lsquo;older sister&rsquo;, Song Xue&rsquo;er, was bound to be related to the Godwish Grandmother too.<br>He had heard from Song Feifei earlier that Song Yun was the sole daughter of the Godwish Grandmother, which meant that Song Yun didn&rsquo;t have an older sister. If so, it was likely that her &lsquo;older sister&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t blood-related, possibly a godsister or her senior.<br>This hinted that Song Xue&rsquo;er was a disciple of the Godwish Grandmother.<br>Of course, this was just a guess on Chu Feng&rsquo;s part, but the teasing smile coming from the Godwish Grandmother&rsquo;s disciple proved it all.<br>&ldquo;Elder, it looks like you go by the name of Song Xue&rsquo;er too?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Feeling confident now that you have met Song Yun? Who allowed you to call me by my name?&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother&rsquo;s disciple replied.<br>Her words indirectly admitted that she was Song Xue&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t dare to disrespect you, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem right to continue addressing a young beautiful woman like you as an elder now that I&rsquo;m aware of the truth,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s words baffled the crowd. No matter how they looked at the Godwish Grandmother&rsquo;s disciple, they couldn&rsquo;t see how anyone could think that she was young and beautiful. They wondered if Chu Feng was just making fun of her.<br>A slight frown formed on the forehead of the Godwish Grandmother&rsquo;s disciple. She wasn&rsquo;t particularly pleased to hear Chu Feng say those words out loud in public.<br>&ldquo;Aiyo, my beloved big sister. You can put away your disguise now. It&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re strangers. You should show your true face.&rdquo;<br>Song Yun ran over to the side of the Godwish Grandmother&rsquo;s disciple and tugged her sleeves.<br>&ldquo;What am I to do with you?&rdquo;<br>The Godwish Grandmother&rsquo;s disciple looked at Song Yun dotingly, different from the usual cold demeanor she took to others. She grabbed her own robe and pulled them downward.<br>Shoosh!<br>As her robe was pulled down, a beautiful long skirt took its place. At the same time, her appearance underwent a huge transformation too. The short and ugly old hag from before disappeared without a trace, replaced with a long and slender woman.<br>She had an innocent face with a fair complexion, but there was a trace of coldness on her facial features.<br>It was the same Song Xue&rsquo;er Chu Feng had met at the Conquerstar Mountain Villa.<br>With the exception of Song Yun, all other women couldn&rsquo;t help but pale in comparison to her in terms of appearance.<br>&ldquo;I never thought that our martial sister would be such a gorgeous woman!&rdquo; Song Feifei and the other disciples of the Dao Sea exclaimed.<br>Even Senior Qiu and the others found themselves gulping down their own saliva.<br>Despite Song Xue&rsquo;er&rsquo;s cold attitude, most men couldn&rsquo;t help but feel attracted to her pure and innocent face.<br>&ldquo;I heard that a disrespectful outsider has arrived in the city?&rdquo; a woman&rsquo;s voice suddenly sounded.<br>The crowd turned their gazes over, and their eyes widened in astonishment. Chu Feng also felt his heart lurch upon seeing where the voice was coming from.<br>It was coming from a middle-aged woman. She didn&rsquo;t stand out in terms of appearance, but she gave off a dignified air. She emanated the aura of a rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivator, and a Situ World Spiritist Clan token could be seen hanging on her body.<br>She must be the elder from the Situ World Spiritist Clan.<br>&ldquo;Paying respects to Lord Zhonglan.&rdquo;<br>Everyone in the vicinity quickly lowered their heads to greet the middle-aged woman, including Song Yun and Song Xue&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, this is an elder from the Totem Galaxy&rsquo;s Situ World Spiritist Clan. She&rsquo;s a rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivator and rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritist. The Situ World Spiritist Clan she comes from is an existence that our entire Eastern Region can&rsquo;t hope to mess with.<br>&ldquo;It appears that she harbors hostility toward you. I reckon that Qiu Long and the others must have ratted on you. If she confronts you, you have to make sure not to talk back to her. Just go along with her. I doubt that she would make things too difficult for you considering that you&rsquo;re our friend,&rdquo; Song Xue&rsquo;er told him through voice transmission.<br>It looked like Song Xue&rsquo;er was a cold-faced, warm-hearted person. Despite her cold attitude, she still showed great concern for Chu Feng&rsquo;s safety.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng pays respects to Lord Zhonglan.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng also clasped his fist and bowed toward Situ Zhonglan.<br>In truth, he felt a little nervous standing before Situ Zhonglan. It was not because he was afraid of her but he was worried that she had already found out about what he had done at the Zhuge Clan.<br>If that was the case, he would be in grave danger.<br>However, judging from Situ Zhonglan&rsquo;s reaction, it didn&rsquo;t seem like she was aware of the happenings at the Zhuge Clan yet.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng. You&rsquo;re the outsider?&rdquo; Situ Zhonglan asked.<br>&ldquo;Lord Zhonglan&hellip;&rdquo; Song Xue&rsquo;er immediately spoke up.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m questioning him. Don&rsquo;t get involved in this,&rdquo; Situ Zhonglan bellowed at Song Xue&rsquo;er.<br>Song Xue&rsquo;er knew right away that things weren&rsquo;t looking good. It was clear from Situ Zhonglan&rsquo;s attitude that she wouldn&rsquo;t let Chu Feng off the hook easily.<br>&ldquo;Elder, I&rsquo;ve indeed just arrived here. However, I was invited by<br>Lady of Dao Sea, so I don&rsquo;t think that I can be considered as an outsider,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re a friend of<br>Lady of Dao Sea. Is that the reason why you dare to challenge our Totem Galaxy?&rdquo; Situ Zhonglan asked.<br>Upon hearing those words, Chu Feng and Song Xue&rsquo;er immediately directed their eyes toward Qiu Long. The latter must have spouted falsehoods before Situ Zhonglan to land Chu Feng in trouble.<br>Chu Feng had never spoken anything about the Totem Galaxy during their confrontation.<br>Qiu Long looked back at them with a look of glee, which verified their guess.<br>However, Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t the type to allow outsiders to frame him for things he hadn&rsquo;t done, so he turned to Situ Zhonglan and tried to explain himself.<br>&ldquo;Elder&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Shut your trap!&rdquo; Situ Zhonglan hollered at him, refusing to listen to his explanation.<br>However, a slight frown suddenly formed on her face then. She quickly took out a couple of talisman papers from her robe, and the look in her eyes grew complicated. There was a trace of nervousness in her eyes.<br>&ldquo;Song Yun, tell your mother that I have urgent matters to attend to. I won&rsquo;t be able to help her with this ancient remnant anymore.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, she quickly left the underground world.<br>The crowd was baffled by the sudden turn of events.<br>However, Chu Feng keenly noticed that those talisman papers were life talismans. It was a talisman created by constructing a formation around one&rsquo;s soul, allowing one to determine the individual&rsquo;s vitals.<br>And the talisman papers that Situ Zhonglan took out earlier were all in a tattered state, suggesting that the owners of those life talismans were on the verge of death.<br></p></div>
