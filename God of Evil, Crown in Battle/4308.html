        <div> - Will Definitely Meet Again<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;My son and I will definitely meet again.&rdquo;<br>There was a faint smile on Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s face as he said those words. Confidence filled that smile.<br>Then, he waved his hand and a spirit formation gate appeared in the space before him.<br>That was a spirit formation gate that crosses the starry sky.<br>A spirit formation gate of that caliber was something that Xianhai Shaoyu would need to use various treasures to set up.<br>Yet, it was accomplished by Chu Xuanyuan with a wave of his hand.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re unwilling to even face your son properly, are you not planning to leave directly?&rdquo; asked the Old Ape after seeing that spirit formation gate.<br>He had determined the spirit formation gate to not be one that would bring them away from the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an acquaintance I have to see,&rdquo; as Chu Xuanyuan spoke, he stepped into the spirit formation gate.<br>The Old Ape turned around to look at Chu Feng. A look of reluctance to part and distress filled his eyes.<br>He knew that once they left, Chu Feng would be all alone again. He would have to confront those vicious martial cultivators and dangers all on his own again.<br>Should he fail even once, only death would await him.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you must catch up to your father.&rdquo;<br>After leaving those words, Old Ape turned around.<br>He deeply desired to leave some things behind for Chu Feng.<br>But, if he did that, he would end up going against Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s wish.<br>The Old Ape would definitely not go against Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s wish.<br>After the Old Ape stepped into the spirit formation gate, the spirit formation gate closed up.<br>Right after the two of them disappeared, a figure stepped through the spirit formation gate from the black case and entered the starry sky.<br>The person that arrived was Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er.<br>When she arrived, she had a look of complete confusion. But, at the same time, she was rejoicing.<br>There was a reason for her joy.<br>She was worried about Chu Feng and Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s safety and had wanted to enter this place to examine how things were going.<br>But, she was shocked to discover that she was unable to enter.<br>It seemed as if there was a power sealing that spirit formation gate.<br>She had attempted multiple times to enter the spirit formation gate but failed every time. Because of that, she became very worried for Xianhai Shaoyu and Chu Feng&rsquo;s safety. She felt that the two of them might&rsquo;ve encountered some sort of unexpected mishap.<br>But, her attempt to enter the spirit formation gate succeeded this time. The power sealing that spirit formation gate suddenly disappeared. Because of that, she was able to once again enter this starry sky. It was only natural for her to be rejoicing.<br>But, upon entering this place, the look of joy on her face immediately disappeared and was replaced with nervousness and confusion.<br>&ldquo;Young master!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>Xianhai Shaoyu discovered the unconscious Chu Feng and Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>While she was very worried for Chu Feng, she still rushed over to Xianhai Shaoyu first.<br>&ldquo;Young master, are you alright?&rdquo;<br>Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er arrived before Xianhai Shaoyu and inquired if he&rsquo;s alright while inspecting him for injuries.<br>&ldquo;Foolish girl, who told you to come in here?&rdquo;<br>But, before Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er could examine Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s condition, Xianhai Shaoyu spoke all of a sudden. He had, by pure coincidence, woken up at this moment.<br>&ldquo;Young master, the two of you are alright?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young master, it&rsquo;s truly great that you&rsquo;re alright.&rdquo;<br>Seeing Xianhai Shaoyu regaining consciousness, Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er grew so emotional that she started crying.<br>She had thought that Xianhai Shaoyu had died.<br>After discovering that he was still alive and his condition was even pretty good, the stone of worry suspended in her heart was finally lifted. Her suppressed feelings were released at once.<br>As Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er was a beauty by her own right, her crying appearance was truly enough to make one feel distressed.<br>But, Xianhai Shaoyu didn&rsquo;t have much heart to comfort Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er. Instead, he immediately got up and examined the surroundings.<br>After all, when he fell unconscious, this region of the starry sky was extremely dangerous.<br>He must ascertain the current situation.<br>&ldquo;Could it be that everything has been taken care of by Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>Seeing that his fourth uncle and the Demon Morph Clansmen were nowhere to be seen, Xianhai Shaoyu was practically certain that Chu Feng, with his bloodline in a berserk state, had eliminated Xianhai Renhu and all those Demon Morph Clansmen.<br>Otherwise, neither he or Chu Feng would remain alive.<br>Even if Xianhai Renhu and the Demon Morph Clansmen found themselves no match for Chu Feng and decided to flee, they would definitely not leave him here.<br>They would at least bring him away. The fact that he was still here meant that Xianhai Renhu and the Demon Morph Clansmen were all dead.<br>Thinking about how his fourth uncle that even he cannot handle was actually killed by Chu Feng and recalling the scene he witnessed before falling unconscious, Xianhai Shaoyu had a slight look of fear in his eyes as he looked at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Taken care of?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young master, are you talking about that power?&rdquo; asked Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er.<br>Not knowing the truth, she didn&rsquo;t know of the arrival of the Demon Morph Clansmen and thought that Xianhai Shaoyu was talking about the terrifying power that filled the sky she witnessed earlier.<br>&ldquo;Mn, that&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;<br>Xianhai Shaoyu did not wish to inform Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er about their encounter with Xianhai Renhu and the Demon Morph Clansmen.<br>But, he informed her how he and Chu Feng managed to withstand the power of the black case together.<br>At the same time, he also informed her that Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent surpassed his own.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent is even stronger than young master&rsquo;s talent?&rdquo;<br>Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er was extremely shocked to learn that matter.<br>As a member of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan, she knew very well how immensely talented Xianhai Shaoyu was.<br>For Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent to surpass Xianhai Shaoyu, it was simply something that she had never imagined in the past.<br>&ldquo;Wuuu---&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, Chu Feng let out a soft groan.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng&rsquo;s woken up.&rdquo;<br>Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er immediately got up and rushed over to Chu Feng happily upon seeing that he had regained consciousness.<br>But, she only took several steps forward before being stunned.<br>&ldquo;Girl, there&rsquo;s no need to control your emotions.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re worried, then go over,&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu helplessly.<br>He was truly not fond of Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s attitude of worrying too much for minor things.<br>&ldquo;Young master, Xin&rsquo;er has made a mistake,&rdquo; said Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;What mistake did you make?&rdquo; asked Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Xin&rsquo;er had carelessly addressed you as young master earlier. It was heard by Chu Feng,&rdquo; said Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Thus, exactly what is the relationship between the two of you?&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, another voice was heard. It was Chu Feng&rsquo;s voice.<br>Looking over, Chu Feng had gotten up and was sitting. He was looking at Xianhai Shaoyu and Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er.<br>Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er lowered her head. She does not dare to look at either Xianhai Shaoyu or Chu Feng.<br>She was worried that Xianhai Shaoyu would blame her and also not sure how to face Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, all of this was done by my instructions. You must not blame Xin&rsquo;er,&rdquo; Xianhai Shaoyu got up.<br>&ldquo;I have no intention to blame either of you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;While I wanted to know more about you all, but if you&rsquo;re unwilling to tell me, I will not force you to.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In the heart of this Chu Feng, the two of you are my friends.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if I don&rsquo;t know your true identities, it will not change our relationship.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;At the very least, I feel that the people that I&rsquo;ve interacted with were really yourselves.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng also stood up as he spoke.<br>&ldquo;Xin&rsquo;er, you can return first,&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er did not hesitate. She turned around and left through the spirit formation gate.<br>&ldquo;It seems like you wanted to tell me something?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>Xianhai Shaoyu smiled upon hearing those words. Then, he suddenly looked at Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Wuqing&rdquo;<br>[1. Wuqing means cold-hearted/heartless.]<br></p></div>
