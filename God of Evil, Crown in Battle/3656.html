        <div> - Battle Experience<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Even if young friend Beiyang Luo didn&rsquo;t mention it, this old man is capable of seeing that.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Held by young friend Nangong Yifan, the halberd possesses marvelous attacks and superb defense. Each and every movement of the halberd is done with extreme mastery. One can tell that young friend Nangong Yifan has especially trained for the sake of his weapon.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In this aspect, young friend Chu Feng is indeed inferior.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, it remains true that young friend Chu Feng&rsquo;s usage of his weapon is better. The reason why that is the case is due to his extraordinary battle experience,&rdquo; said Lord Shoujian.<br>&ldquo;Battle experience? Battle experience, you say?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are you implying that Chu Feng is the only one who has something like battle experience?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;My junior brother Nangong has trained bitterly every day since he began martial cultivation. Those that acted as his sparring partners are all our sect&rsquo;s seniors. In terms of battle experience, no one would have more battle experience than my junior brother Nangong,&rdquo; said Beiyang Luo.<br>&ldquo;You yourself also said those were spars. While it is true that sparring will increase one&rsquo;s battle experience, the amount of progress is nevertheless limited.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, on the other hand, is different. His battle experience is most definitely not gained from sparring. Instead, it was forced into him through countless life and death battles.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Perhaps you all are unable to comprehend what this old man has just said. You are all of high birth, and belong to major powers. Normally, people will keep their distance from you out of fear. No one dares to provoke you. Furthermore, you&rsquo;re protected whenever you go on a journey. When have any of you ever experienced true danger?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, it is different for young friend Chu Feng. Although this old man does not know what sort of experiences he has had, I can tell from the way he fights that his abilities are all learned from life and death battles.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is something that you all do not possess. It is an advantage that only young friend Chu Feng possesses,&rdquo; said Lord Shoujian.<br>&ldquo;My goodness, if it&rsquo;s as Lord Shoujian has said, wouldn&rsquo;t it mean that my brother Chu Feng would have life and death confrontations with people for no reason? That&rsquo;s truly a fierce life.&rdquo;<br>Kong Tianhui&rsquo;s jaws dropped from shock. He was not the only one. The Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations were all shocked.<br>They all knew Lord Shoujian very well, and knew that he never lied. In fact, he would never mention anything that he was not certain of.<br>Thus, they firmly believed in Lord Shoujian&rsquo;s words, and didn&rsquo;t doubt him one bit.<br>&ldquo;Why am I suddenly feeling sympathy for him?&rdquo; The gaze with which Kong Ci looked to Chu Feng had changed.<br>&ldquo;Sympathy? For who?&rdquo; Kong Tianhui asked.<br>&ldquo;Who else other than your brother Chu Feng?&rdquo; said Kong Ci.<br>&ldquo;Ah? What&rsquo;s there to feel sympathy about?&rdquo; asked Kong Tianhui.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, are you truly this stupid? What sort of person would be able to experience so many life and death struggles?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This means that Chu Feng has never been protected by anyone his entire life. That is why he experienced all those dangers.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, wasn&rsquo;t it said that he was originally banished to the Lower Realms? Wasn&rsquo;t he deemed to be someone who was unable to cultivate since birth?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, it was not the Chu Heavenly Clan that brought him back to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. I&rsquo;ve heard that he returned to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm on his own.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, while he might also be a person of the younger generation like us, what he has experienced is most definitely completely different from us,&rdquo; said Kong Ci.<br>&ldquo;Sssss~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hearing what you said, that seems to really be the case.&rdquo;<br>After hearing Kong Ci&rsquo;s words, Kong Tianhui and the others also began to look at Chu Feng with sympathy in their eyes.<br>Indeed, they had all heard of Chu Feng being incapable of cultivation. Together with his father, they were expelled from the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>While being expelled was one thing for someone like Chu Xuanyuan, Chu Feng was only an infant back then.<br>Furthermore, what sort of places were the Lower Realms? They were places that contained extremely scarce natural energies, and were simply incomparable to the Upper Realms.<br>To people like Kong Tianhui, Ordinary Realms were remote and desolate places. As for the Lower Realms, those were simply places that they would never wish to go to in their entire lives.<br>&ldquo;Clank~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Clank~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Clank~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the sound of weapons colliding grew more and more frequent, more and more ear-piercing.<br>The crowd was able to see that the speed at which Chu Feng and Nangong Yifan were brandishing their weapons became so fast that even Kong Ci and the others were unable to see them clearly.<br>&ldquo;Those two guys, they&rsquo;re simply too overly powerful, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;They are truly amazing. I wouldn&rsquo;t dare imagine that they&rsquo;re actually only rank two Exalted like us. They&rsquo;re still fighting without using any martial skills or Immortal Techniques.&rdquo;<br>Kong Ci and Long Ning&rsquo;s eyes were wide open, and completely fixed on the battle between Chu Feng and Nangong Yifan.<br>&ldquo;Claaaankkk~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, an extremely ear-piercing sound was heard. Following that, Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s halberd was sent flying. As it spun, it left an utter mess in its path. In the end, it fell over ten thousand meters away.<br>When the crowd looked to Chu Feng and Nangong Yifan again, they discovered that Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s arms were trembling violently, and his hands were drenched in blood.<br>However, when they looked at Chu Feng, they not only discovered that the Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword was still held in his hand, but they also discovered that he was completely uninjured, and his hand that held the sword was not shivering in the slightest.<br>Seeing that, the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations were all overjoyed.<br>The All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations, on the other hand, all had gloomy looks on their faces.<br>In the beginning, they had not believed Lord Shoujian&rsquo;s words.<br>However, at that moment, the truth was before their eyes, and they had no choice but to believe it.<br>Chu Feng was indeed terrifyingly strong. At the very least, his battle experience far surpassed Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s!!!<br>&ldquo;Do you know the disparity between us now?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked Nangong Yifan.<br>&ldquo;Again,&rdquo; As Nangong Yifan spoke, he extended his hand and made a grabbing motion. His halberd that was shot far away flew into the air and landed in his hand.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Following that, Nangong Yifan brandished the halberd again to unleash attacks at Chu Feng.<br>This time around, Chu Feng&rsquo;s body shifted nonstop. He was dodging Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s attacks without any intention of fighting back.<br>However, to everyone&rsquo;s surprise, Nangong Yifan was unable to injure Chu Feng at all. Regardless of how exquisite his attacks were, they were all effortlessly dodged by Chu Feng. It seemed like Chu Feng had seen through all of Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s attacks.<br>&ldquo;What is Chu Feng doing?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, why isn&rsquo;t Chu Feng fighting back?&rdquo;<br>Many people felt confused by his actions.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that you still don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Nangong Yifan.<br>Even though he was avoiding Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s frantic attacks the entire time, his voice was extremely calm and composed. It could be seen that he was dodging his attacks effortlessly and without any pressure.<br>&ldquo;Bastard! Fight back!&rdquo; Nangong Yifan shouted with rage. He simply did not care what Chu Feng was thinking, what he was trying to do. All he knew was that his behavior was extremely insulting.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll satisfy you then.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, like a phantom, Chu Feng took a step forward and stopped dodging Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s attacks. Instead, he rushed to attack him.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s speed was too fast. By the time Nangong Yifan realized that Chu Feng had unleashed an attack at him, it was already too late.<br>&ldquo;Puchi~~~&rdquo;<br>As the sword swept past, blood splattered everywhere.<br>At the same time as Chu Feng passed by Nangong Yifan, he left a bloody wound on Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s left waist.<br>&ldquo;Eeeahhh~~~&rdquo;<br>Once the sword struck him, Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s body immediately grew stiff. Then, he sat powerlessly on the ground. He realized that the situation was bad, and immediately covered his wound with his hand.<br>At that moment, the crowd were able to see frost spreading from Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s wound.<br>Soon, the frosty aura covered Nangong Yifan completely. From a glance, Nangong Yifan looked like a snowman covered in ice and frost.<br>&ldquo;That sword&rsquo;s poisonous!&rdquo; The All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations immediately shouted. Anger filled their voices. It was as if Chu Feng had done some sort of intolerable thing.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not poison. It&rsquo;s the coldfrost aura. It is as Lord Shoujian stated earlier, that is the advantage of my sword. It&rsquo;s just like how the advantage of Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s halberd is how tough and strong it is.&rdquo; After explaining, Chu Feng looked to Nangong Yifan again. &ldquo;Do you understand now?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I wanted to defeat you, I merely needed to land a single strike on you. Earlier, I fought you head-on because I wanted you to understand that even if I am to use the weakness of my Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword to take on the strong point of that halberd of yours, I would still be able to beat you to a state of being unable to hold onto your weapon.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is the disparity between you and I,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;This bastard!&rdquo;<br>The All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations turned pale with anger upon hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words. At the same time, they were feeling very pained as they looked at Nangong Yifan.<br>They felt that Chu Feng was simply too ruthless. He was clearly capable of directly defeating Nangong Yifan. Yet, he refused to do so. Instead, he decided to torment him nonstop.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s intention was simply too obvious. He was deliberately trying to cause trauma to Nangong Yifan.<br></p></div>
