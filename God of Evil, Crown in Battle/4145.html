        <div> - Chu Feng&rsquo;s Worry<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The series of giant words formed by the black clouds had covered the entire region.<br>They left behind an enormous shadow that covered all the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>Upon thinking that the terrifying lightning from earlier was actually related to Chu Feng, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen finally realized that they&rsquo;d courted a calamity.<br>All of the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen turned deathly pale and shivered in fear.<br>None of them dared to even say anything.<br>They&rsquo;d offended someone they could not afford to offend.<br>&ldquo;Putt~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, someone knelt on the ground. It was the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder Zuoqiu Hanxun.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a misunderstanding. This is all a misunderstanding. We truly never intended to make things difficult for Chu Feng. We never intended to make him the Lightning Guide. This is truly all a misunderstanding.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Milord, please forgive us, please forgive us.&rdquo;<br>Zuoqiu Hanxun began to kowtow as he apologized. His behavior was like that of a commoner pleading to the gods for forgiveness. His behavior was extremely low and humble.<br>This scene shocked all of the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>That was their aloof and remote Supreme Elder. Never had they seen him act so humble and low before.<br>Suddenly, Zuoqiu Hanxun shouted at the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen, &ldquo;Why are you all still standing there?! Quickly, kneel down!&rdquo;<br>Anger filled his voice.<br>Once his words were spoken, the other Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen immediately knelt.<br>They began to beg for forgiveness with him.<br>However, there was still someone standing. That would be the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Zzzzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, lightning began to surge in the black clouds again.<br>The lightning that suddenly appeared turned all the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen pale with fright.<br>The sudden reappearance of the lightning seemed to be a warning.<br>But, who was it warning? Naturally, it would be the only person that hadn&rsquo;t knelt, their Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>Seeing that, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s expression contorted in fear and he immediately knelt.<br>He was terrified. He was afraid that the lightning would strike down at him.<br>Even though the lightning in the sky was not as numerous as before, it was still as mighty, still something that he could not contend against.<br>Surprisingly, after the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief knelt, the lightning not only began to dissipate, but even the black clouds began to scatter.<br>Although they&rsquo;d avoided a crisis, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen were even more terrified than before.<br>This was especially true for their Lord Clan Chief.<br>He had originally been slightly skeptical as to whether or not the events were truly related to Chu Feng.<br>However, he had confirmed that the matter was truly related to Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng possessed an enormous origin. Behind him was an enormous and even omnipotent existence.<br>Even though the black clouds had scattered, cold sweat still covered the faces of the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen. They continued to kneel for a long time, afraid to get up.<br>They had nearly suffered the extermination of their entire clan.<br>&hellip;...<br>Chu Feng had no knowledge of what had happened after he left.<br>Although he had managed to successfully leave the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation using the teleportation formation, the process of the teleportation had still taken some time.<br>Chu Feng had decided on where to teleport with Fumo Shaoyu and Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>Because of that, after some time passed, Chu Feng exited the teleportation channel.<br>When Chu Feng exited he saw Fumo Shaoyu and Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, it&rsquo;s truly great that you&rsquo;re alright.&rdquo;<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er and Fumo Shaoyu immediately ran over to him.<br>Even though they had joyous smiles on their faces, Chu Feng could see how worried they were.<br>Evidently, those two friends that he had not known for very long had been worried about his safety the entire time.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s over now,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I saw. Although the distance was very far, I still saw the lightning that gathered in the sky.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The might of the Divine Lightning Affliction is truly not in vain.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, you must&rsquo;ve successfully made a breakthrough, right?&rdquo; asked Fumo Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>After that, he gave the Fumo siblings a detailed account of the things that had happened inside the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.<br>This included how he had defeated the two geniuses of the Zuoqiu Clan, and how he placed a curse on Zuoqiu Tiancheng.<br>After learning what had happened the Fumo siblings were unable to conceal their happiness, and were smiling gleefully.<br>They both felt what Chu Feng had done to be truly refreshing.<br>The only unfortunate thing was the fact that they had not been there to personally witness how he had toyed with the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>That said, after being immersed in joy, Fumo Shaoyu noticed that something was amiss, as Chu Feng did not have much of a joyous look on his face.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, you&rsquo;ve taught the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan a huge lesson. Thus, why do you look unhappy?&rdquo; asked Fumo Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;The Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan is extremely powerful.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I was only able to gain the upper hand with the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation&rsquo;s barrier and your teleportation formation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In terms of actual strength, I am far inferior to them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;During the time I crossed swords with them, I forgot to conceal my identity. With that, they will definitely retaliate against me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even though I&rsquo;ve left a curse on Zuoqiu Tiancheng to prevent them from retaliating against me, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan will definitely not let this matter go. They will most definitely investigate my identity.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, they will also request the help of experts to remove the curse.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;re unable to remove the curse, they will have restraining fear, and will not dare to mess around.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if there&rsquo;s someone that is capable of removing the curse, they will not have any apprehensions anymore, and will most definitely unleash a massacre upon everyone related to me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Sooner or later, my clan will be exposed. At that time, I would&rsquo;ve brought a disaster upon my clansmen,&rdquo; Chu Feng revealed his worries.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, I am able to understand your worries. Since that&rsquo;s the case, let us return to your clan first. We can think of a way to hide your clansmen.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, ten years is not too late for a nobleman to take revenge.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Whilst you might not be a match for them now, you will definitely surpass them in the future.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would not be too late to seek them out for revenge then,&rdquo; said Fumo Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;But, I&rsquo;ve agreed to help a senior of mine.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Judging from the time, I might be slightly late already. I must go and find that senior first.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What I&rsquo;m afraid of is that if I go and help my senior first, and then return to inform my clansmen afterward, it&rsquo;ll be too late,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s simple. Tell me where your clan is located, and I&rsquo;ll go help you inform them,&rdquo; said Fumo Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to trouble brother Shaoyu then,&rdquo; Chu Feng immediately thanked Fumo Shaoyu.<br>Although he would be inconveniencing him, that was still a very decent decision.<br>With that, Chu Feng and Fumo Shaoyu made their arrangements.<br>Fumo Shaoyu would go and inform the Chu Heavenly Clan, and then meet up with him at the Immortal-bestowment Upper Realm.<br>&ldquo;In that case, big brother, I&rsquo;ll see you later,&rdquo; said Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;See me later?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Girl, what do you mean by that? Could it be that you&rsquo;re planning to follow brother Chu Feng and abandon your big brother?&rdquo; Fumo Shaoyu opened his mouth wide in shock.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, I wanted to see the world. You&rsquo;re only going to notify Chu Feng&rsquo;s clan. Once you&rsquo;re done, you&rsquo;ll come find us. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be fine?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, you have my tracking talisman. It would be easier for you to find us if I&rsquo;m with Chu Feng,&rdquo; Fumo Xin&rsquo;er said with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;To put a person of the opposite sex over your own brother, you&rsquo;re truly devoid of conscience.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Very well, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er, I, Fumo Shaoyu, will remember this.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Farewell.&rdquo;<br>After he finished saying those words, Fumo Shaoyu stepped into a teleportation formation.<br>Even though Fumo Shaoyu had a look of sorrow as he expressed his farewell, Chu Feng and Fumo Xin&rsquo;er were both smiling.<br>They knew that Fumo Shaoyu was only acting sad as a joke.<br>Even though Chu Feng had only known Fumo Shaoyu for a short period of time, he knew that he was a very reliable person.<br>Thus, he was certain that Fumo Shaoyu would be able to properly notify his clansmen.<br></p></div>
