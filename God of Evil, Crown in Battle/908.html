        <h1>Chapter 908</h1>
        <div> - Opening up a Path of Blood<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>Another round of attacks smashed into the defensive formation, and the shock it received was even more intense than before.<br>Even though Chu Feng and Qiushui Fuyan had come deep into the Misty Peak, they were still able to see the pressure the defensive formation withstood, as well as the endlessly exploding shock waves.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you should know what to do, right?&rdquo; Seeing the already cracked formation, Qiushui Fuyan cast her gaze towards the altar on the peak.<br>&ldquo;Sister Fuyan, I will do my best.&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded, then walked towards the so-called Altar of Exorcism.<br>The altar looked very odd on the surface&mdash;it was like a sinister monster&rsquo;s skull, and its huge mouth was the entrance.<br>After Chu Feng entered, he discovered that the inside was even odder. What was burning within were black flames, but those black flames were able to emit faint light. It made the large palace a bit gloomy, and also a bit eerie.<br>But in reality, due to Chu Feng&rsquo;s current cultivation, even if there were no flames he could still see everything inside clearly. He could see that the altar was very large, but very empty. The only important thing was its center.<br>In the center of the altar, there was a tall stage where a mirror stood. It was oval-shaped, and a dozen or so meters tall. It was also nearly ten meters wide, and looked like a vertical eye staring at himself.<br>Chu Feng knew the mirror was the thing he needed to use to make contact with the mysterious existence. So, Chu Feng went up to the mirror, half-knelt on the ground, and deeply bowed.<br>&ldquo;You came here to ask me for help, right?&rdquo; But before Chu Feng even spoke, an aged voice&mdash;one that seemed it had been through eons of immense changes&mdash;came from the mirror. That voice was the exact same as the<br>mysterious existence&rsquo;s back then in the Martial Marking Immortal Realm<br>.<br>Even though it was only a voice, Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart still couldn&rsquo;t help lightly trembling. That person was really too powerful. Just by hearing the voice alone let him know how horrifying of an existence it was.<br>&ldquo;Senior, since you know about everything that&rsquo;s happening outside, why aren&rsquo;t you driving them away? Instead, you&rsquo;re allowing these people to disturb your peace?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked, feigning confusion.<br>When they were heading over to this altar, Qiushui Fuyan had told him a few things. The Misty Peak was originally a Sealing Formation. As for the master of this place, no one knew who it was. Lady Piaomiao had suspected that the sealed mysterious existence was, in reality, the true master of the Misty Peak.<br>So, Chu Feng knew the mysterious existence he saw within the Martial Marking Immortal Realm, though seemed like a monster whose strength was immense, might not have been sealed here for a simple reason. No one knew the truth, but what they did know what this mysterious existence had the ability to save them.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s mission was to do everything he could to get this mysterious existence to help.<br>&ldquo;Why should I do anything? That girl is the guardian of this place. If she doesn&rsquo;t have the ability to guard, then so what if the person is switched?&rdquo; The mysterious voice rang out again, lacking any sort of empathy.<br>&ldquo;But Senior, Lady Piaomiao [Immortal Lady Piaomiao] has guarded this place for so many years. Even if she hasn&rsquo;t done great deeds, she has still put hard work into it. Can you bear letting her die from battle because she&rsquo;s guarding this place?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Immortal Lady?<br>She&rsquo;s<br>worthy of this appellation of &lsquo;immortal&rsquo;? Do you think she&rsquo;s gotten any few amount of benefits from this place? If she hadn&rsquo;t cultivated on the Misty Peak, with the aptitude she has, how could she possess her current cultivation, and how could she have lived up to today?<br>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s guarding this place not to guard me, but to guard herself. If she can&rsquo;t fight them off, then it can&rsquo;t be blamed on any person.<br>&ldquo;However, for you, I will point you a path of life.&rdquo;<br>*hmm* Suddenly, a ripple appeared on the mirror. A body of light the size of a fingernail bore out from it, and floated up to Chu Feng.<br>Giving it a detailed examination, Chu Feng discovered it was a rune, but absolutely not a simple one. The energy contained within seemed to be able to change a few things.<br>&ldquo;Take this. Go nine thousand miles away from the Misty Peak, and at that time, this will shine with light. Crush it, then a formation will appear. It will seal everyone behind you within the Misty Peak. Within twenty hours, it will deactivate.<br>&ldquo;This time should be sufficient for your escape. But the precondition is that you can break through this surrounding attack and put all of them behind.&rdquo; That voice started to gradually fade away before it completely disappeared.<br>Chu Feng knew the mysterious existence had left. No matter how he pleaded, it would be useless.<br>That existence came from the Ancient Era, and lived for several tens of thousands of years. It had likely seen all sorts of things, and it couldn&rsquo;t be convinced just by a few words.<br>So, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t bother with it anymore. He stood up, and after bowing, he walked straight out of the altar.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, how is it? Were you able to make contact with the mysterious existence?&rdquo; Qiushui Fuyan was waiting outside. She quickly went up after seeing Chu Feng exit.<br>&ldquo;Sister Fuyan, I&rsquo;ll make this short. The mysterious existence replied, but it&rsquo;s unwilling to help. However, it is not ignoring us either, and gave us a chance to escape.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this.&rdquo; As Chu Feng spoke, he took out the mysterious rune, and told her its usage.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to imagine it actually responded to you. This is truly unbelievable.&rdquo; After hearing what had happened, Qiushui Fuyan&rsquo;s face was full of shock. However, she did not dally and after simply sealing that place, she brought Chu Feng back to the entrance.<br>*boom boom boom boom boom boom*<br>After arriving at the entrance, the attacks coming from Jiang Qisha&rsquo;s formation became fiercer and fiercer. Chu Feng could clearly see, as those monsters blew up, glass-like cracks appearing on the defensive formation. It was truly in immediate danger, and it would shatter at any moment.<br>&ldquo;Fuyan, Chu Feng, how did it go?&rdquo; Lady Piaomiao quickly asked.<br>At that moment, she was a bit pale. Clearly, she had exhausted quite some power by holding up both the defensive formation and the Immortal Sword Formation.<br>&ldquo;Lady Piaomiao, I&rsquo;ll give this to you.&rdquo; Chu Feng quickly gave the rune to Lady Piaomiao, then gave her a simple explanation on how to use it to escape.<br>Chu Feng could tell the Misty Peak could not be defended. Right now, if they wanted to survive, the only way was to break through the surrounding attack.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, since it gave this to you, then you use it.&rdquo; However, after knowing what had happened, Lady Piaomiao did not put away the rune and instead gave it back to Chu Feng.<br>Quickly after, she extended her finger and drew a circle on the ground. Only then did she cast her gaze towards the crowd behind her, and shouted, &ldquo;Chu Feng, Fuyan, Chun Wu, Xia Yu, Qiu Zhu, Dong Xue, Zi Ling, Su Rou, Su Mei, Yan Ruyu, Jiang Wushang, and Zhang Tianyi! All of you stand inside the circle. Today, we will slaughter our way through, and open up a path of blood.&rdquo;<br></p></div>
