        <h1>Chapter 5076</h1>
        <div>: The Conferred King<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Brightsun, what are you doing?!&rdquo;<br>The Asura King and the other Asura Evil Spirits were so immersed in their joy and excitement of escaping from this place that it took them a while to register Prince Brightsun&rsquo;s action. However, it was already too late. Chu Feng and Yaoyao had already fallen into the terrifying hellfire.<br>Enraged, the Asura King immediately flew over to the King&rsquo;s Stand and grabbed Prince Brightsun.<br>&ldquo;Lord Father, can&rsquo;t you see? Your daughter has already become Chu Feng&rsquo;s lackey. She only recognizes Chu Feng! If she successfully gains control over our Asura World Spirit Army, we&rsquo;ll just become the lackeys of another!&rdquo; Prince Brightsun exclaimed.<br>&ldquo;What are you saying? She&rsquo;s your younger sister! She&rsquo;s our hope out of here!&rdquo;<br>The infuriated Asura King raised his palm up high. If this palm were to fall, Prince Brightsun would die without a sliver of doubt.<br>&ldquo;Milord, look!&rdquo;<br>The leaders of the Asura Evil Spirits quickly rushed toward the King&rsquo;s Stand too. At their exclamation, the Asura King quickly lowered his gaze onto the King&rsquo;s Stand and realized that the ritual was still ongoing despite Yaoyao&rsquo;s disappearance.<br>Yaoyao&rsquo;s blood was proliferating by itself and slowly cloaking the King&rsquo;s Stand.<br>&ldquo;Just a single droplet of blood was enough? Our Asura World Spirit Army is saved!&rdquo;<br>Overjoyed by that sight, the Asura King tossed Prince Brightsun away.<br>The Asura Evil Spirits turned their focus back to the King&rsquo;s Stand with anticipation on their faces. There was not a single one of them who felt upset by Yaoyao&rsquo;s death as if the sole purpose of her existence was to activate the King&rsquo;s Stand.<br>Finally, the King&rsquo;s Stand was completely covered in Yaoyao&rsquo;s blood.<br>The King&rsquo;s Stand began to glow with divine light, but the light only lasted for a short moment before dissipating. At the same time, the blood also started to dry up.<br>Everything was reverting back to normal. The ritual had failed.<br>&ldquo;Milord, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; the Asura Evil Spirits asked the Asura King.<br>The Asura King stared at the King&rsquo;s Stand without saying a word. The look of despair on his face was enough to tell the others this wasn&rsquo;t the outcome they were wishing for.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha!&rdquo;<br>A weak but joyful laugh suddenly echoed in the Asura King Palace. It was from Lord Yunliang. He had awoken at some point in time and had witnessed everything that had happened.<br>&ldquo;I told you that our master has to be an Asura World Spiritist and not one of our own. The only one who can lead us out of here is a great Asura World Spiritist, not an Asura World Spirit! You didn&rsquo;t believe me and even resorted to all sorts of underhanded tricks. But where did it get us?<br>&ldquo;There are indeed traitors among us, but it isn&rsquo;t me but the rest of you. You are all traitors who have turned your back on Lord Massacre!&rdquo; Lord Yunliang sneered.<br>All of the Asura Evil Spirits were too despaired to pay any heed to Lord Yunliang.<br>Weng!<br>&ldquo;It looks like you&rsquo;re doomed to be trapped here. However, it matters not. My master will bring me to the peak of this world of cultivation. Farewell, Lord Father. I&rsquo;ll surpass you.&rdquo;<br>Prince Brightsun suddenly smiled as if this was what he had hoped to happen. He took out a teleportation talisman and crushed it, invoking a teleportation formation around him. With a burst of light, he vanished into thin air.<br>&ldquo;Milord, that&rsquo;s the means of a world spiritist! Prince Brightsun has connections with world spiritists?&rdquo; the Asura Evil Spirits asked in astonishment.<br>However, the Asura King was in no mood to answer them.<br>Putong!<br>The Asura King fell to his knees, having lost all of his motivation. Tears began streaming from his eyes. The powerful and lofty Asura King had actually started crying!<br>The Asura Evil Spirits were shocked. This was the first time in tens of thousands of years that they had witnessed such a show of weakness from the Asura King.<br>&ldquo;Lord Massacre, it was not my intention to betray you. Tens of thousands of years have already passed, but the world spiritist you spoke of never arrived. We didn&rsquo;t turn our backs on you. You were the one who deceived and abandoned us first. Even if we were useless to you, you shouldn&rsquo;t have kept us imprisoned here. Is it our fault for wanting to be free? We were so loyal to you, so why must you treat us so?!&rdquo;<br>The Asura King wailed indignantly.<br>The other powerful Asura Evil Spirits also started sobbing as they were reminded of their sorrowful past. Even Lord Yunliang had tears in his eyes.<br>Boom boom boom!<br>The Asura King Palace suddenly started trembling, prompting the Asura Evil Spirits to quickly snap out of their sorrow and scan the surroundings vigilantly.<br>All phenomena should have already come to a halt now that the ritual had failed.<br>&ldquo;Milord, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;<br>Perplexed by the situation, the Asura Evil Spirits turned their sights toward the Asura King, only to notice the latter Asura King staring intently at the hellfire. It was only then that they realized that the hellfire was blazing much more fervently than before.<br>They quickly glanced at the King&rsquo;s Stand and the throne, but neither of them were reacting. Clearly, the cause of the trembling was the hellfire.<br>It was baffling since the hellfire was potent enough to turn any of them into ashes within moments. It was something to be feared. Yet, the hellfire was suddenly reacting at this moment. Was this a sign that Lord Massacre was going to punish them for their disloyalty?<br>That realization sent the Asura Evil Spirits into a state of panic, including the stronger ones too.<br>Boom!<br>A bundle of hellfire suddenly rose into the air and flew straight for the throne, enveloping it whole. It flowed down the throne like lava, revealing two silhouettes hidden within.<br>They were Chu Feng and Yaoyao!<br>Chu Feng happened to be sitting on the throne whereas Yaoyao was held in his arms. They were both safe and unharmed.<br>However, there was a massive change in Chu Feng&rsquo;s body. He was shrouded in a layer of black gaseous flames, and his eyes were glowing with a black luster. Even his disposition was completely different from before.<br>The current him felt more like a demon king than a human!<br>The black gaseous flames shrouding him was asura power, but it was no ordinary asura power. It harnessed incredible purity that compelled deference from all of the Asura Evil Spirits present, including the Asura King.<br>&ldquo;How did this happen?&rdquo;<br>The Asura King and the other Asura Evil Spirits stared at the sight before them in shock, not understanding how this could have happened. It was incomprehensible to them how Chu Feng and Yaoyao could have escaped from the hellfire.<br>But what was even baffling to them was how Chu Feng was emanating an aura that commanded their deference.<br>It was as if Chu Feng was their master.<br>&ldquo;Milord, look! W-w-what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;<br>One of the Asura Evil Spirits pointed to the plaques with a trembling finger. Astonishment filled his face, and his mouth was so wide open that one could stuff an egg into it.<br>The crowd quickly looked over, but what they saw left them with the exact same expression as him too, including the Asura King. They were shocked beyond words by what they had seen.<br>Words had started appearing in the empty parts of the three plaques, and their meaning jolted the hearts of every Asura Evil Spirit.<br>Written on the Hellfire Plaque was &lsquo;<br>The day when He rises from the flames<br>&rsquo;.<br>Written on the King&rsquo;s Stand Plaque was &lsquo;<br>The leader of the Asuras shall be crowned<br>&rsquo;.<br>Words had also appeared on the empty plaque above the throne.<br>Hail your new king, Chu Feng!<br></p></div>
