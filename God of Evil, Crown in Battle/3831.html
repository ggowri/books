        <h1>Chapter 3830</h1>
        <div> - True Identity<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The crowd&rsquo;s eyes were filled with fear and alarm as they looked at Fan Chou.<br>This was especially true for Li Xiao and the other younger generations.<br>They had thought that Fan Chou was a person of the younger generation with low birth and mediocre strength.<br>Li Xiao and the others were all unable to comprehend why Fan Chou had been invited by Grandmaster Yuan Shu.<br>But, why would the oppressive might that Fan Chou had unleashed be so powerful?<br>Utmost Exalted? He was actually an Utmost Exalted, someone much stronger than even Zhang Duotuo?<br>&ldquo;Everyone, your questioning of brother Asura is equivalent to questioning myself.&rdquo;<br>At the moment when the crowd were all confused, Fan Chou&rsquo;s appearance suddenly transformed.<br>He transformed into a middle-aged man.<br>He had a robust build and a handsome look. Even his outfit had changed.<br>He was dressed in white, and gave off an extraordinary air. He was simply excellent in every respect. From a glance, one could tell that he was an extraordinarily grand character.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster Yuan Shu?&rdquo;<br>Soon, cries of alarm sounded from all directions.<br>Their voices informed Chu Feng of Fan Chou&rsquo;s true identity.<br>It turned out that Fan Chou was actually Yuan Shu.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster Yuan Shu, why would you be&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Even Zhang Duotuo revealed a nervous expression.<br>Although he was a famed individual in the Reincarnation Upper Realm, that was only the case in the Reincarnation Upper Realm.<br>However, Grandmaster Yuan Shu was different. He was someone who possessed great status throughout the entire All-heaven Starfield.<br>After all, Grandmaster Yuan Shu was the strongest world spiritist of the Reincarnation Upper Realm.<br>Li Xiao, Meng Rufei and the others had turned deathly pale, and started shivering in fear.<br>They hid behind their seniors, and did not dare to say anything.<br>Thinking of how the Fan Chou that they had pushed around was actually the renowned and extraordinary Grandmaster Yuan Shu, they realized that they had messed around with the most powerful individual present, which was equivalent to having a deathwish.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Yuan Shu did not say anything to the panicky crowd. Instead, he waved his sleeve, and a spirit formation gate appeared before the crowd.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, I&rsquo;ll have to trouble you with passing through this gate," Yuan Shu said to Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng understood Yuan Shu&rsquo;s intention, and directly stepped into the spirit formation gate.<br>After he passed through the spirit formation gate without any mishaps, the crowd all gasped with shock.<br>The people present were practically all world spiritists. Regardless of whether they were strong or weak, they were all able to tell what that spirit formation gate&rsquo;s usage was.<br>That was a spirit formation gate that only the people of the younger generation could pass through. Since Chu Feng had managed to pass through it, it meant that his age was indeed within a hundred years old.<br>&ldquo;Is there anyone else that calls me into question?&rdquo; asked Yuan Shu.<br>&ldquo;Truly a young hero. It is this old man who was dull-eyed.&rdquo; Zhang Duotuo forced a smile.<br>The others also all began to praise Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What a dull-eyed. Could it be that Grandmaster Duotuo and everyone else are all planning to use a single &lsquo;dull-eyed&rsquo; to apologize for this matter?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Earlier, you all were planning to bully the young, and teach this brother Asura a lesson.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for me stepping in to stop you, it is possible that he might have encountered some sort of mishap. Are you planning to settle this matter, settle your crime, with a single &lsquo;dull-eyed&rsquo;?&rdquo; Yuan Shu said with a mocking smile and a cold gaze.<br>This caused the crowd to feel even more embarrassed and, more than anything, afraid.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Asura, this old man was dull-eyed and nearly made an enormous blunder today. I hope that young hero Asura is a person of great moral stature that will not take offense to the crimes committed by one of low moral status, and forgive this old man.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, someone directly asked for forgiveness. It was actually Li Xiao&rsquo;s senior.<br>Li Xiao&rsquo;s senior was not cowardly and craven. It was simply that he could not afford to offend Yuan Shu.<br>After Li Xiao&rsquo;s senior spoke, the others also began to ask Chu Feng for forgiveness.<br>In the end, even that Zhang Duotuo also acknowledged his mistake to Chu Feng, and apologized with an embarrassed look on his face.<br>That said, the crowd felt that what they were doing was only natural.<br>After all, that fellow by the name of Asura was protected by Grandmaster Yuan Shu.<br>Furthermore, the crowd were also able to tell that it was indeed Zhang Duotuo and the others that were in the wrong.<br>That said, even after Zhang Duotuo and others apologized, Grandmaster Yuan Shu did not directly let the issue be. Instead, he looked towards Chu Feng. &ldquo;Brother Asura, do you think this would do?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng immediately responded, &ldquo;I will give Grandmaster Yuan Shu face and let the matter pass like this.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, your Reincarnation Upper Realm&rsquo;s cultivators are not only dull-eyed, but their hearts must also be blind.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;To deem that I am not a person of the younger generation just because I&rsquo;m a Saint-cloak World Spiritist, what utter ridiculousness.&rdquo;<br>Hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words, Zhang Duotuo and the others all felt as if they were vomiting blood in their hearts.<br>Chu Feng was simply cursing them out.<br>However, it just so happened that no matter how displeased they felt after hearing his words, they did not dare to refute him.<br>After all, what Chu Feng had said was reasonable too.<br>They had truly been dull-eyed.<br>They were truly in the wrong.<br>&ldquo;Since brother Asura is not going to look further into the issue, this matter is settled.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I hope that something like this does not happen again.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We are all people that have been in the martial cultivation world for many years; we should know about the nature of cultivators.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not everyone is as broad-hearted with others as brother Asura.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If the person you all had encountered today was someone who fussed over minor matters like yourselves, you should be able to imagine what sort of consequences you would suffer.&rdquo;<br>Yuan Shu&rsquo;s words were still filled with cutting remarks.<br>After he finished saying those words, Yuan Shu disappeared.<br>Chu Feng disappeared with him.<br>After Yuan Shu and Chu Feng left, the people that had been trying to teach Chu Feng a lesson earlier all heaved a sigh of relief.<br>That said, they were still sweating immensely. Ice-cold sweat had soaked their entire bodies.<br>Ignoring the fact that Grandmaster Yuan Shu had spared them, they recalled the words spoken by Grandmaster Yuan Shu and felt them to be very reasonable.<br>That Asura was a person of the younger generation with an Exalted realm cultivation and Saint-cloak-level spirit techniques.<br>Judging as a whole, that Asura was a genius even more powerful than their All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s strongest genius, Nangong Yifan.<br>Being able to be regarded so highly by Grandmaster Yuan Shu, that Asura was most likely backed by a colossus.<br>In other words, such a genius couldn&rsquo;t possibly have been nurtured without being backed by a colossus.<br>To be able to live after offending such a genius, it was truly a narrow escape from death.<br>That said, there was no such thing as an absolute.<br>Even though the great majority of people realized that the person of the younger generation by the name of Asura must possess a remarkable background, and made the decision to avoid him should they encounter him in the future, a gloomy and cold gaze flashed across Zhang Duotuo&rsquo;s eyes...<br>&hellip;&hellip;<br>Chu Feng had been brought to a peaceful location by Yuan Shu.<br>This was a garden. The garden was located atop a cliff. On the other side of the cliff was a group of waterfalls.<br>The scenery of that place was truly beautiful.<br>Arriving there, one would even feel much more relaxed.<br>&ldquo;Never would I have imagined that senior was right beside me. Yet, I failed to recognize senior. I am truly dull-eyed,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>If it wasn&rsquo;t for Yuan Shu revealing his true identity himself, Chu Feng would never have known that Fan Chou was actually a disguise.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to address me as senior just because of my identity.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If we must talk about age, I&rsquo;m actually not that much older than brother Asura.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How about we continue to address one another as brothers?&rdquo; said Yuan Shu.<br>&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t be good, no?&rdquo; Chu Feng revealed a look of embarrassment. After all, Yuan Shu was the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s close friend.<br>If Chu Feng were to address Yuan Shu as brother, wouldn&rsquo;t the Ox-nosed Old Daoist beat him up should he learn about it?<br>&ldquo;Why not? I don&rsquo;t think that brother Asura is someone who cares about this sort of trivial matter, no?&rdquo; asked Yuan Shu.<br>&ldquo;Speaking of it, I am truly ashamed. My name is actually not Asura. Instead, it&rsquo;s Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng stood up. His facial appearance also began to transform. He returned to how he originally looked.<br>Chu Feng felt that since Yuan Shu was sincere towards him, he should not conceal anything from Yuan Shu either.<br>After all, he would have to sooner or later state his reasons as to why he was there.<br>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In that case, may I know why brother Chu Feng is hiding his name?&rdquo; asked Yuan Shu.<br>Chu Feng informed Yuan Shu about the events leading up to his journey.<br>Not only did he tell Yuan Shu that he did not wish to bring enmity upon his clan and had decided to change his appearance because of that, he also informed Yuan Shu of his purpose in journeying to meet him.<br>&ldquo;So brother Chu Feng is actually the disciple of my master&rsquo;s close friend.&rdquo;<br>Yuan Shu also revealed a look of surprise upon learning the truth. At the same time, he was also delighted, and very excited.<br>He even stood up and began to size Chu Feng up again.<br>His intense gaze became even more passionate and amiable.<br></p></div>
