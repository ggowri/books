        <h1>Chapter 4193</h1>
        <div> - Shocked<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon learning that Chu Feng had also ended up in the sealed world, Old man Zhao immediately brought his granddaughter Zhao Menglu over.<br>Even though he didn&rsquo;t say it explicitly, Chu Feng could tell that Old man wanted to marry his granddaughter Zhao Menglu to him.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, this old man Golden Crane has praised you to me a whole lot.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He said you&rsquo;re the strongest cultivation genius he had ever met.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;May I know what young friend Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation is right now?&rdquo; Old man Zhao asked all of a sudden.<br>Before Chu Feng could respond, the Golden Crane True Immortal said, &ldquo;Old man Zhao, I fear that you&rsquo;ll be shocked. Thus, let me warn you first.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent is extremely amazing.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even though it has only been a short few years since I parted with him, his cultivation was most definitely not stagnant the entire time. It is very likely that his cultivation had increased by leaps and bounds,&rdquo; said the Golden Crane True Immortal.<br>&ldquo;Right, right, right. I don&rsquo;t need you to tell me. I&rsquo;m going to let young friend Chu Feng tell me,&rdquo; Old man Zhao rolled his eyes at the Golden Crane True Immortal in annoyance before looking to Chu Feng.<br>The Golden Crane True Immortal and Zhao Menglu also looked to Chu Feng.<br>Their eyes were also filled with expectation.<br>Seeing how they were all placing high hopes on him, Chu Feng felt slightly embarrassed. Afraid to disappoint them, Chu Feng coughed twice before saying, &ldquo;When mentioning my cultivation, I am truly ashamed. Although this Chu Feng has tried his hardest to train, the growth of my cultivation is still lacking.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right now, I&rsquo;ve only just stepped into the Utmost Exalted realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Utmost Exalted realm?!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s words brought horror to the faces of the three people.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re saying that you&rsquo;re an Utmost Exalted now?!&rdquo; the Golden Crane True Immortal asked.<br>&ldquo;Mn. Rank one Utmost Exalted,&rdquo; answered Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Sssss---&rdquo;<br>Seeing the certainty in Chu Feng&rsquo;s response, the Golden Crane True Immortal gasped in shock.<br>However, at the same time he narrowed his brows. A look of worry appeared on his face.<br>&ldquo;Senior Golden Crane, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Nothing. Everything&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;ve just entered this place and have experienced that terrifying spirit formation. You must be feeling unwell. But, you shouldn&rsquo;t worry. Things will all improve with time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t bother you anymore. Go and properly rest yourself first.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;A proper rest might allow you to recover your cultivation sooner.&rdquo;<br>As the Golden Crane True Immortal said those words, he pushed Chu Feng towards the palace serving as his residence.<br>As Chu Feng was not interested in continuing the chat with old man Zhao and Zhao Menglu, he immediately nodded at the Golden Crane True Immortal&rsquo;s proposal. Just like that, he returned to his residence to rest.<br>&ldquo;Sigh...&rdquo;<br>However, after Chu Feng left the Golden Crane True Immortal heaved a deep sigh. &ldquo;It would appear that young friend Chu Feng has received quite an enormous shock.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. He actually ended up having a delusional disorder. Saying something like he&rsquo;s an Utmost Exalted, does he even know what sort of concept Utmost Exalted is?&rdquo; said Zhao Menglu.<br>&ldquo;Menglu, do not be rude!&rdquo; Old man Zhao immediately criticized her.<br>&ldquo;Grandpa, I am not being rude. Look at him, he&rsquo;s saying that he&rsquo;s an Utmost Exalted.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Grandpa Golden Crane say that Chu Feng had only been a Martial Ancestor when he parted ways with him in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How could his cultivation undergo such an enormous change in a short few years?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If he said that he had reached the True Immortal realm, then I could barely accept it to be true.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, he actually said he&rsquo;s reached the Utmost Exalted realm? That&rsquo;s simply too ridiculous.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not only do I not believe him, I&rsquo;d say that grandpa doesn't believe him either, no?&rdquo; Zhao Menglu asked old man Zhao.<br>&ldquo;Eh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Regarding this&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Even though Zhao Menglu&rsquo;s words were unpleasant to the ears, old man Zhao had to admit that what she said was correct.<br>In fact, even the Golden Crane True Immortal was shaking his head and sighing repeatedly.<br>Even he felt that Chu Feng&rsquo;s answer was simply too unbelievable.<br>No matter how amazing Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent might be, it should be impossible for him to surmount the True Immortal realm, Heavenly Immortal realm, Martial Immortal realm and Exalted realm to become an Utmost Exalted in a short few years.<br>Not to mention the Utmost Exalted realm, merely the Exalted realm would make him an existence that could move about unhindered throughout the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>One must know that even the Golden Crane True Immortal, the master of the Dao Imperial Palace, was still only a peak Martial Immortal even after so many years of training.<br>But, the Dao Imperial Palace was one of the strongest powers in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>According to the knowledge of the Golden Crane True Immortal, even the strongest expert of the Chu Heavenly Clan was only an Exalted realm expert, and at the initial stages of Exalted realm on top of that.<br>Even if Chu Feng possessed exceptional talent, it should still be impossible for him to reach the Utmost Exalted realm in such a short period of time.<br>That was the reason why the Golden Crane True Immortal had said that Chu Feng had received an enormous shock.<br>He was not suspecting that Chu Feng was boasting to them, because he knew that Chu Feng was not someone to boast about such things.<br>Instead, he felt that Chu Feng must&rsquo;ve received some sort of major shock that caused his mind to become unstable. He believed that it was the reason why he had ended up saying such a thing.<br>&ldquo;Menglu, young friend Chu Feng has only just entered this place. It is normal for him to be out of sorts.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, I&rsquo;ve witnessed his talent with my very eyes. He is truly a rare cultivation genius, a demon-level genius.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that you&rsquo;re a very good cook.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Perhaps you should show more consideration toward him and accompany him a bit more. Perhaps once his mood turns for the better, his frame of mind will also recover more quickly.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Once his cultivation recovers, won&rsquo;t we know what his actual cultivation is then?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;According to my judgement, with young friend Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent, reaching the True Immortal realm would not be hard for him in the slightest. Even reaching the Heavenly Immortal realm is not an impossibility,&rdquo; said the Golden Crane True Immortal.<br>&ldquo;Heavenly Immortal realm?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Grandpa Golden Crane, are you serious?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He could become a Heavenly Immortal at his age?&rdquo; Zhao Menglu asked in disbelief.<br>&ldquo;Menglu, when have I ever lied to you?&rdquo; asked the Golden Crane True Immortal.<br>&ldquo;Right. Old man Golden Crane never lies.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Menglu, you must properly look after Chu Feng. With his talent, if he weren&rsquo;t trapped here, he would definitely not find you a match for him. You must treasure this opportunity,&rdquo; Old Man Zhao encouraged from the side.<br>&ldquo;I got it, grandpa,&rdquo; Zhao Menglu nodded.<br>The next day. Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation still hadn&rsquo;t recovered. He had decided to go out and take a stroll around.<br>He wanted to understand the place he was in.<br>He learned that it was exactly as the Golden Crane True Immortal had told him.<br>Even though the people there had all been sucked in there by the black spirit formation gate, they&rsquo;d been there for too long and had grown accustomed to living there.<br>They did not resemble people who were trapped, as they were all cheerful and lively. The atmosphere there was very harmonious.<br>This was understandable. After all, for some people, they&rsquo;d been trapped there for so long that they'd ended up starting families there.<br>Old man Zhao was one such example. He had found himself a wife after arriving there. They had ended up having a son, and their son had brought them Zhao Menglu.<br>Thus, it was not only Zhao Menglu that had grown up there.<br>Even Zhao Menglu&rsquo;s father had been born there.<br>They were people that did not understand the world outside, and had no idea how dangerous of a world it was.<br>All the knowledge they had about the outside were only things they&rsquo;d heard from others.<br>The only experience and knowledge that they truly possessed were of the sealed world.<br>Because of that, many among them did not long for the outside world. They believed that it would be fine to remain trapped there forever.<br>After all, to them, the sealed world might as well be the real world.<br></p></div>
