        <div> - Entering The Water Naked<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, it seems that you are very fond of this Chu Feng,&rdquo; That Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder said.<br>&ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo; The Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because this is the first time that this subordinate has ever seen you creating a shortcut for someone,&rdquo; That Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder said.<br>His words revealed the mystery.<br>It turned out that it was not because Chu Feng&rsquo;s stupid method was actually effective.<br>Rather, it was due to this Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief secretly helping Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I have always been one to look down on the human race&rsquo;s brats, for they are simply too selfish, and have no regard for others. They are even more inhumane than us monstrous beasts.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, this brat by the name of Chu Feng actually made me feel a whole new level of respect toward him. Thus, I decided that I might as well help him this once.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Merely, that Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Daughter is not as simple as this Chu Feng has seen.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That girl is very dangerous. If Chu Feng is to encounter her in Buried Spirit Lake, he might have to face more dangers.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, Buried Spirit Lake is a strange place. No spirit formations can be set up there. We are unable to see what happens there.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of that, and the fact that we are not allowed to approach Buried Spirit Lake when it is opened to the public, we will not know should something happen to Chu Feng, and will not be able to help him either.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of that, he can only rely on himself in there,&rdquo; The Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;That brat Chu Feng seemed to be very quick-witted. Furthermore, he is not weak either. Even if that Xia Yun&rsquo;er wants to take care of him, it is not necessarily true that he will not be able to handle her. Thus, Lord Clan Chief, you need not worry about that,&rdquo; That Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder said.<br>&ldquo;Worry?&rdquo; The Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief laughed. Then, he said, &ldquo;It is one thing to think highly of someone. However, as for his life and death, it is completely unrelated to me.&rdquo;<br>&hellip;...<br>Meanwhile. Xia Yun&rsquo;er was holding the flying insect compass and rapidly proceeding toward Buried Spirit Lake.<br>She soon managed to pass through the vast forest and arrived at a stone forest.<br>At that moment, the stone forest was growing denser and denser with more stones. The size of the stones was also becoming larger and larger.<br>Those stones were somewhat special. One could not see through them regardless of what sort of ability one might use. With all those enormous stones blocking one&rsquo;s path, one simply could not see ahead.<br>Being inside that stone forest, one would feel uneasy.<br>Compared to the vast forest, this place resembled a maze even more.<br>However, the more this was the case, the more joyous Xia Yun&rsquo;er felt. Although Xia Yun&rsquo;er had only revealed herself to the people of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm for a short period of time, it was actually not her first time in the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain or Buried Spirit Lake.<br>As such, Xia Yun&rsquo;er was very familiar with that vast mountain. She knew very well that she would arrive at Buried Spirit Lake after passing through this stone forest.<br>Finally, Xia Yun&rsquo;er successfully passed through the stone forest. After she did, her speed grew much slower.<br>The reason for that was because a lake had appeared before her field of view. That lake was not very large, and did not seem particularly special. However, the lake&rsquo;s water was extremely clear.<br>As for that lake, it was Buried Spirit Lake.<br>At that moment, an enchanting smile was present on Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s exquisite little face. She was feeling joy from the bottom of her heart.<br>After all, what she had said to Chu Feng earlier, the fact that one would obtain more comprehension the fewer people there were in Buried Spirit Lake, was true.<br>As such, she knew very well what sort of comprehension she would obtain by being the only person here.<br>&ldquo;My thanks.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a pleasant yet cold-sounding voice sounded from behind Xia Yun&rsquo;er.<br>Xia Yun&rsquo;er was immediately alerted upon hearing that voice. Subconsciously, she took out her two silver swords.<br>Those two silver swords were Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s Incomplete Immortal Armaments.<br>With her Incomplete Immortal Armaments in hand, Xia Yun&rsquo;er did not say anything, and directly brandished her weapons to slash behind her.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>In an instant, two blade rays were shot behind her with an extremely fast speed.<br>However, after her slashes were sent forth, Xia Yun&rsquo;er discovered that there was simply no one behind her.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to be this nervous. After all, it is you who brought me here. Thus, I will not drive you out of here.&rdquo;<br>Right at the moment when Xia Yun&rsquo;er was surprised, that voice sounded once again. Merely, this time around, that voice sounded from the direction of Buried Spirit Lake.<br>Xia Yun&rsquo;er did not attack rashly again. Instead, she turned around and cast her gaze over. She wanted to see exactly who it was.<br>When Xia Yun&rsquo;er saw who it was, not only did she relax, but she also smiled.<br>The reason for that was because that person was someone that Xia Yun&rsquo;er knew. She was the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s young miss with an extraordinary status, Chu Lingxi.<br>&ldquo;I guess this is what they mean by the mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind. Lady Chu Lingxi, you have truly made me have a whole new level of realization and respect for you,&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er said.<br>It was only at that moment that Xia Yun&rsquo;er realized that Chu Lingxi must&rsquo;ve been secretly following her the entire time.<br>Merely, she had not been aware of Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s presence in the slightest. Thus, it came as an enormous surprise and a slight disappointment for her.<br>She was not feeling disappointed because she was unable to enjoy Buried Spirit Lake by herself.<br>It was because she had anticipated that she would be the final victor after obtaining the flying insect compass from Chu Feng. Yet now, it would appear that the final victor was Chu Lingxi.<br>That was the reason why she was disappointed.<br>&ldquo;I had originally thought that the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Daughter would be a kindhearted woman akin to celestial fairies.&rdquo;<br>Chu Lingxi smiled lightly. Her smile was extremely beautiful. Then, she looked to Xia Yun&rsquo;er and said, &ldquo;Miss Xia has also made me feel a whole new level of respect.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As the saying goes, every man for himself. In my opinion, even celestial fairies should act like this,&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er said.<br>&ldquo;I do not disagree with that,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, it would mean that Lady Chu Lingxi and I are kindred spirits?&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er asked.<br>Chu Lingxi smiled. Her smile was very clean and pure, like the water of Buried Spirit Lake.<br>It would be hard for ordinary individuals to see through her smile.<br>However, Xia Yun&rsquo;er managed to see through her smile. It was precisely because she saw through Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s smile that her eyebrows narrowed slightly.<br>She had managed to see a trace of ridicule from Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s smile. Chu Lingxi&hellip; was not fond of Xia Yun&rsquo;er.<br>That said, Xia Yun&rsquo;er was also not fond of Chu Lingxi. However, even though she did not like Chu Lingxi, there was nothing she could do. Instead, she must appear as if she liked her.<br>Disregarding their status, merely in terms of strength, Chu Lingxi was not someone that the current Xia Yun&rsquo;er could take on.<br>As for Chu Lingxi, she also knew very well that Xia Yun&rsquo;er could not pose any threat to her. Thus, even though she knew that Xia Yun&rsquo;er was a poisonous woman behind her celestial fairy-like beauty, she was not afraid of her at all.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost time,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said.<br>Her body shifted. Like a celestial fairy, she landed beautifully in Buried Spirit Lake.<br>After she entered Buried Spirit Lake and saw that Xia Yun&rsquo;er was still not coming in, Chu Lingxi was confused. Thus, she turned around and looked to Xia Yun&rsquo;er.<br>Seeing the current Xia Yun&rsquo;er, Chu Lingxi shouted, &ldquo;What are you doing?! Have you gone insane?!&rdquo;<br>The reason for this was because Xia Yun&rsquo;er was currently undressing. Soon, she had stripped herself completely naked.<br>At that moment, Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s practically perfect body appeared before Chu Lingxi in a completely unmasked manner.<br>Fortunately, Chu Lingxi was a woman. Otherwise, if it was a man that saw such a scene they would definitely not be able to withstand that sort of enticement.<br>&ldquo;Lady Chu Lingxi, have you not heard that one will obtain greater comprehension after entering Buried Spirit Lake naked?&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er had a pleasant smile on her face as she walked toward Chu Lingxi.<br>&ldquo;This is Buried Spirit Lake, it is the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s territory. Are you not afraid that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan will be monitoring this place right now? Are you not afraid that your body will be seen by them?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said.<br><br><br>Check out the June Giveaway for a chance to win $200, $100 or $50 Visa Gift Card<br><br></p></div>
