        <div> - The Origin Of The Unknown Burial Ground<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Why wasn&rsquo;t the situation explained directly in the letter? Why did you have to write it like that?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked in a confused manner.<br>Naturally, what Chu Feng was asking about was how, in the letter, Kong Yuehua and Kong Shunlian were threatening Chu Feng, saying that Zhao Hong was in their hands.<br>&ldquo;It remains that Kong Shunlian and Kong Yuehua are from the Kong Heavenly Clan. On the one hand, they felt hatred toward you. On the other hand, they felt that their Kong Heavenly Clan was in the wrong. Thus, their hearts have been in a state of torment the entire time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;They wanted to use this opportunity to verify exactly how much you value your friends.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you truly valued friendship, they might&hellip; end up no longer looking further into the grudges between you and the Kong Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; The guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief said.<br>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the case,&rdquo; Chu Feng came to a sudden realization.<br>&ldquo;You should not blame them. After all, they are people from the Kong Heavenly Clan. Likely, their hearts are suffering more than anyone else,&rdquo; The guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief said.<br>&ldquo;That I understand.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, is it possible for you to show me what Zhao Hong&rsquo;s current situation is?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Young Master Chu Feng, please have a look. Zhao Hong&rsquo;s current situation is not optimistic at all.&rdquo;<br>The guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief took out a blue crystal. It was a very peculiar crystal; it was actually rectangular in shape.<br>At that moment, a black image like a person&rsquo;s shadow was flickering inside the rectangular crystal. That image was not fully black in color. Instead, it was flickering with a red light in many locations. Furthermore, the entire image was also flickering nonstop.<br>&ldquo;The red lights signify injuries, and the flickering means she&rsquo;s in fatal danger?&rdquo; Chu Feng turned to ask the guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief.<br>&ldquo;What Young Master Chu Feng says is correct. If the image disappears, it means that Zhao Hong has encountered a mishap,&rdquo; The guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief said.<br>&ldquo;Then could it be that Zhao Hong has become incapable of using that treasure capable of teleporting her out of the Unknown Burial Ground?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;No, that teleportation treasure is definitely effective. I believe in the power of that treasure because it was something that a Lord from the Chu Heavenly Clan left behind,&rdquo; The guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief said in a very determined manner.<br>After hearing that, Chu Feng came to realize why the guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief was so certain in the effectiveness of that teleportation treasure. Since it was a treasure left behind by the Chu Heavenly Clan, it should possess great effectiveness in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no time to lose. I will enter the Unknown Burial Ground right now,&rdquo; As Chu Feng spoke, he began to move toward the direction of the Unknown Burial Ground.<br>He was truly worried about Zhao Hong&rsquo;s safety.<br>&ldquo;Young Master Chu Feng, please wait.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, the guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief suddenly stopped Chu Feng. He said, &ldquo;Please use this.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief took out a case from his Cosmos Sack.<br>It was a very exquisite and extraordinary case. From this, it could be seen that the item contained inside the case would be no small matter.<br>Otherwise, there would be no reason for the guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief to keep that item in such an exquisite and extraordinary case.<br>After opening the case, what appeared was a compass.<br><br>That compass was very special. Although it appeared to be an actual substance, Chu Feng was able to tell from a single glance that the compass was a teleportation formation. Furthermore, it was a very powerful spirit formation. At the very least&hellip; it would be impossible for the current Chu Feng to set up such a spirit formation.<br>In the center of the compass was another smaller circular compass. That compass was only the size of a coin. However, it was glistening with golden light. Moreover, it possessed a very soft appearance. It was as if that compass was created from water, and would shatter upon the slightest exertion of strength.<br>This smaller compass was also a teleportation formation.<br>Even without the guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief explaining things to him, Chu Feng knew what the two compasses were for.<br>Most likely, these two compasses were the treasure that could allow one to teleport anywhere in a close range to a specific location.<br>&ldquo;Young Master Chu Feng, please extend your hand,&rdquo; The guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief said to Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng did as he said and extended his hand. The guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief picked up the small compass and placed it on Chu Feng&rsquo;s palm. Then, he instilled his spirit power into the small compass and formed a special hand seal.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Like water, that small compass started to disperse. In the blink of an eye, it had assimilated into Chu Feng&rsquo;s palm.<br>That small compass was still present. However, it was currently imprinted into Chu Feng&rsquo;s palm like a tattoo.<br>&ldquo;Young Master Chu Feng, if you are to encounter danger and want to leave the Unknown Burial Ground immediately, you merely need to clench your palm and think about activating the teleportation formation. With that, you will be teleported out,&rdquo; The guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief said.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s also this. This is&hellip;&rdquo; The guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief took out another case. After opening the case, two beads appeared.<br>One was a medicinal pellet, whereas the other was a blue rectangular crystal.<br>Chu Feng knew that this must be the same crystal that Zhao Hong used that could determine her state of being.<br>&ldquo;Young Master Chu Feng, please swallow this medicinal pellet,&rdquo; The guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief handed the medicinal pellet to Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng swallowed the medicinal pellet without hesitation. After swallowing the medicinal pellet, Chu Feng felt a strange sort of power spreading through his body. Soon, that power was absorbed by his body. Not only did that power merge with Chu Feng&rsquo;s flesh and bones, but it seemed to have even merged with Chu Feng&rsquo;s source energy and soul.<br>Furthermore, Chu Feng was able to see that as the medicinal pellet merged with his body, a shadowy image gradually appeared on that blue rectangular crystal.<br>That shadowy image was different from the one in Zhao Hong&rsquo;s rectangular crystal. Not only was it not emitting any red light, but it was also not flickering. It was very clear and stable.<br>Evidently, this shadowy image represented Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Senior, you do not have to worry too much about me. I know what to do,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to the guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief.<br>Chu Feng knew very well that the guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief did all this because he was worried about Chu Feng&rsquo;s safety.<br>&ldquo;Young Master Chu Feng, perhaps there are some words that this old man should not say. However, I urge you to keep in mind that your body, hair and skin are all given to you by your parents. If you are to truly encounter danger, you must not act impetuously.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if you do not consider yourself, you must still consider your family. Think about&hellip; what they will be feeling,&rdquo; The guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief advised Chu Feng earnestly and well-meaningly.<br><br>He seemed to understand Chu Feng very well. He knew that Chu Feng was someone who was loyal and righteous. For his friend&rsquo;s safety, he was able to disregard everything.<br>Chu Feng was moved by the words spoken by the guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief.<br>It was true. If something were to happen to him, how aggrieved would his father and mother be?<br>Most importantly, he had yet to even meet his mother. If he were to die just like that, Chu Feng would have deep regrets even in death.<br>&ldquo;I will keep that in mind,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Then, together with the guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief, Chu Feng returned to the area where the Unknown Burial Ground was located.<br>The guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief placed the other spirit formation compass on the ground.<br>If Chu Feng planned to teleport out, he would have to rely on that grand spirit formation compass.<br>That said, some time was needed in order to activate the spirit formation compass.<br>After that compass reached the ground, it immediately increased in size. It grew to the size of a watermelon, and then continued to grow until it was thirty meters long and ninety meters tall. This enormous spirit formation was glistening with light.<br>Compared to how it was before, this spirit formation simply looked like a completely different thing.<br>Originally, Chu Feng wanted to help. However, the guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief insisted on finishing the spirit formation himself.<br>With no other option, Chu Feng ended up standing aside as a spectator.<br>&ldquo;Senior Kong Yuehua, can you tell me why this place is called the Unknown Burial Ground?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked curiously.<br>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Kong Yuehua nodded. Then, she said to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Actually, compared to the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm&rsquo;s other remnants, this Unknown Burial Ground has not been around for long. In fact, it could be said that it was very recently discovered.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It appeared roughly two thousand years ago. At that time, the Unknown Burial Ground was not buried underneath this desert. Instead, it was a vast building complex.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It was exquisite, spectacular and intimidating.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It was simply indescribable with words. It simply did not resemble buildings, but was more like a piece of art. Looking at it, one would easily be captivated by it.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Chu Feng noticed that Kong Yuehua&rsquo;s expression changed. It was as if she was recalling the scene back then.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng was certain that Kong Yuehua was one of the witnesses to the appearance of the Unknown Burial Ground back then.<br><br></p></div>
