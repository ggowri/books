        <div><span>: I Am Confident In My Talents Too</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>With the unraveling of the martial power formation, Chu Feng began making his way back to the pedestal with a head in his hand. It was the head of a soul, but this head was different from the other souls in the formation.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Were you the one who unraveled the formation?&rdquo; Feng Ling asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;How did you do it?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;All formations have openings. It&rsquo;s futile to kill those souls since they are endlessly regenerated by the martial power formation, so I had to find another way out. While Miss Feng Ling was dealing with the souls, I noticed something peculiar about one of the souls. I figured that it might be the key to clearing the trial, so&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he lifted the head of the soul.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Quell the bandits by first apprehending their chief. Sharp observation, young master Chu Feng.&rdquo; Feng Ling looked at Chu Feng in a different light.</span><br><span>In truth, she had been trying to figure a way to breach the formation all this while, but she wasn&rsquo;t able to uncover its crux. She didn&rsquo;t even notice that soul until Chu Feng carried its head back. It made her realize that Chu Feng was much more formidable than she had thought.</span><br><span>However, she soon turned to the head in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand and asked, &ldquo;Young master Chu </span><span>Feng, why hasn&rsquo;t this head dissipated when the martial power formation has already unraveled?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure either. I examined the head but there wasn&rsquo;t anything special about it. I guess I can keep it as spoils of war,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he stowed away the head.</span><br><span>Weng!</span><br><span>Spirit power suddenly appeared out of nowhere and gushed at the pedestal, forming a massive cage that imprisoned Chu Feng and Feng Ling. Under the effects of the cage, Chu Feng noticed that his martial power had been sealed off, but he regained control over his spirit power.</span><br><span>He wasn&rsquo;t able to exert his spirit power earlier when he entered the martial power formation, and the situation was the opposite this time around. Clearly, this was a sign that the spirit power trial had begun.</span><br><span>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re moving straight into the second trial? That&rsquo;s too fast! They should have at least given a heads up,&rdquo; Feng Ling cursed.</span><br><span>Chu Feng turned to Feng Ling and saw that the white aura around her had vanished, a sign that her martial cultivation had been sealed off.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, my spirit power is inferior to yours. I&rsquo;ll be counting on you for this,&rdquo; Feng Ling said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;No worries, leave it to me,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.</span><br><span>Meanwhile, the spirit power outside manifested into a slaughter formation. The slaughter formation slipped through the cage to attack the two of them.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hmph!&rdquo; Chu Feng was able to stop the attack with a casual wave of his hand.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, this&hellip;!&rdquo; Feng Ling was stunned.</span><br><span>Chu Feng was exerting power comparable to a Purple Dragon God-cloak despite being a Blue Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist. As if that wasn&rsquo;t shocking enough, the formation he had constructed was so powerful that it could have been constructed by a Gold Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist instead.</span><br><span>With his unbelievable heaven-defying battle power, he was able to easily keep the attacks at bay even though new slaughter formations were being continuously formed to bombard them with attacks.</span><br><span>As soon as his formation was completed, the cage began to unravel. The spirit power that had appeared out of nowhere also began to dissipate.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What does this mean? Have we cleared the second trial?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Feng Ling stared at Chu Feng in disbelief. She couldn&rsquo;t come to terms with how easily Chu Feng had overcome the formation.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a confident smile.</span><br><span>Feng Ling fell into deep thoughts. She knew that she would have never been able to clear the spirit power trial as easily as Chu Feng did, if she was even able to do so in the first place.</span><br><span>Woo!</span><br><span>Ghastly wails echoed from the surroundings once more, but the voices this time around were much more frightening than the ones from the martial power formation.</span><br><span>Innumerable silhouettes comprising both humans and beasts alike appeared from all directions. These figures were so colossal that they could have crushed realms with their stomps. Such existences were bound to be intimidating.</span><br><span>However, Chu Feng showed no fear at all, for not only had he recovered his martial power and spirit power, but an unprecedented surge of strength also flowed into his body. With his newfound strength, he felt like he could put up a fight even against these colossal silhouettes.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, things aren&rsquo;t looking good for us. Let&rsquo;s retreat to the pedestal.&rdquo; Eggy didn&rsquo;t think that Chu Feng could deal with the situation as she was unaware of his surge of strength.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, Eggy. Have you forgotten what I told you? This is the third trial, the one I&rsquo;m the most confident of,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;How do you intend to deal with it?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I feel an unprecedented surge of power within me. I reckon that it&rsquo;s the quantification of my talent,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;How great is the power?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that anyone can oppose me on this land,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>Feng Ling suddenly spoke up with a vibrant smile, &ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, the third trial evaluates one&rsquo;s talents. My spirit power might be inferior to yours, but my talent is at least passable. Leave this trial to me.&rdquo;</span><br><span>She had clearly obtained considerable strength from the quantification of her talent too.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s finally time for me to reveal my strength,&rdquo; Feng Ling said.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>A flood of white aura poured out from her body as she instantaneously flitted a distance spanning innumerable realms to stand before the colossal silhouettes.</span><br><span>Grar!</span><br><span>Feng Ling hurled out a punch that caused the colossal silhouettes to growl in pain, but those growls quickly turned into infuriated roars. In retaliation, the colossal silhouettes opened their mouths and released a massive beam of light toward Chu Feng and her.</span><br><span>&ldquo;This is bad.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Feng Ling swiftly lost her confidence in the face of the light beam. She could feel death encroaching on her, knowing that it was impossible for her to withstand the light beam even with her current surge of strength.</span><br><span>Tzlala!</span><br><span>Suddenly, there was a lightning bolt that instantaneously shattered the beam of light before zapping toward the colossal silhouettes. This time around, the colossal silhouettes were reduced to dust without even getting a chance to howl.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, you!!!&rdquo; Feng Ling was dumbstruck.</span><br><span>She could tell that the lightning bolt that destroyed the colossal figures was released by none other than Chu Feng.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Ah, I forgot to tell Miss Feng Ling that I am confident in my talents too,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.</span><br></p></div>
