        <div> - Going Against One&rsquo;s Master; Rebellion<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>The golden war sword stood horizontally in the sky, covering it and shadowing the earth.<br>Like a god, the sword overlooked the beings below. It emitted an overwhelming and unparalleled aura.<br>&ldquo;This is the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword, the secret skill created by the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan&rsquo;s ancestor?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What a powerful aura. Secret skills&hellip; there really are differences in strength between them.&rdquo;<br>After sensing the aura of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword, great waves emerged in Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart.<br>Although Chu Feng had felt overwhelming power from the Four Symbols Secret Skills and the Five Elements Secret Skills when he had first encountered them, if Chu Feng were to encounter the Four Symbols Secret Skills or the Five Elements Secret Skills with his current cultivation, he would definitely be able to easily subdue them.<br>After all, the current Chu Feng was already a peak Half Martial Ancestor. If he were to be in the Holy Land of Martialism with his cultivation, he would most definitely be an unparalleled individual capable of covering the sky with his hand.<br>However, even with his current level of cultivation, Chu Feng felt extremely tiny when underneath the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword; he was unable to feel his strength at all.<br>If the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword above Chu Feng&rsquo;s head was a mountain, then the current Chu Feng would be an ant. The disparity in strength between them was simply akin to the disparity between heaven and earth, unable to be discussed alongside one another.<br>This Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword was simply too powerful. Not to mention in the War Clan&rsquo;s Ancient Domain, it would be incomparable even in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>&ldquo;We, descendants of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan, pay our respects to Lord War Sword!!!&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, led by the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the four grand elders, all of the grand characters present knelt onto the ground.<br>Following them, the rest of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clansmen present also kneeled.<br>There were also people that had rushed over due to the commotion, and upon seeing that scene, they too kneeled on the ground.<br>Simply none of the people in the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan considered the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword as a secret skill.<br>Rather, it appeared more like they considered the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword their ancestor, a sort of relic. No one dared to show any trace of disrespect toward the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword.<br>Respect and reverence toward the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword filled the everyone&rsquo;s heart.<br>At the same time, they were also joyous.<br>&ldquo;A bunch of trash. You all are a disgrace to the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, an extremely imposing voice sounded from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword.<br>That voice was extremely stunning. Not only did it shake the air, but it also shook the hearts and souls of the crowd.<br>Upon hearing that voice, many of the War Clansmen started to frown. They revealed extremely scared expressions. One by one, they lowered their heads and did not dare to raise them again.<br>&ldquo;Lord War Sword, we are indeed incompetent. We were actually beaten back continuously by the Monstrous Clan. Right now, we have lost all of our territories. Even this final territory of ours is facing imminent danger.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, with Lord War Sword here, our Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan will definitely be able to exterminate the Monstrous Clan,&rdquo; The Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief thought that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword was reprimanding them because they were losing in the battle against the Monstrous Clan.<br>&ldquo;Not only were you all beaten to such a state by that bunch of trash from the Monstrous Clan, but now you all actually want me to help you? You all are truly useless.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You are not qualified to be the descendants of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan. Your continued existence will only serve to bring humiliation to the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan. Today&hellip; I will get rid of all you trash on behalf of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan so that you do not bring humiliation to the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan after leaving this place in the future.&rdquo;<br>Once the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword said those words, overwhelming killing intent immediately filled the entire Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan.<br>Not to mention the people directly underneath the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword, everyone in the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan felt that frightening killing intent.<br>&ldquo;This secret skill is actually planning to exterminate the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan? Is this not going against its master? Is this not a rebellion?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is truly getting a little interesting,&rdquo; At that moment, even Her Lady Queen revealed a surprised expression. However, she appeared to be more like someone who was enjoying a show. she was in very high spirits.<br>To Her Lady Queen, a secret skill would remain a secret skill. Regardless of the enormous power a secret skill might have, it would still remain an instrument for others to use.<br>And now, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword actually wanted to eliminate everyone from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan. To Her Lady Queen, this sort of reaction was no different from a rebellion against one&rsquo;s master.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, this&hellip; this&hellip;&rdquo;<br>At that moment, everyone in the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan started to panic. One by one, they turned their gazes to their Lord Clan Chief.<br>They had originally thought that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword would assist them in taking care of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Monstrous Clan after waking up. Never did they expect that it would instead want to kill them.<br>This was simply the complete opposite of what they thought would happen. Overwhelmed with panic, they had no idea what to do. As such, they could only entrust their final hopes with their Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Lord War Sword, you have not shown any sign of movement for all these years. For you to come out today, did you really do so just for the sake of eliminating us?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If we are to be eliminated, this War Clan&rsquo;s Ancient Domain will become the Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s world. Wouldn&rsquo;t you have helped the Monstrous Clan then?&rdquo; The Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>There was not the slightest trace of anger in his tone. On the contrary, only confusion, irreconciliation and absolute humility were present.<br>&ldquo;I have no heart to concern myself with the battle between you all and the Monstrous Clan. However, the Martial Comprehension Ground is what Zhan Aoxue left for you all. Yet, right now&hellip; you all, for the sake of flattering someone, were planning to allow an outsider to use it. Tell me, do you all still have any dignity?&rdquo; The Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword said.<br>At that moment, the crowd came to a sudden realization. It turned out that the reason the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword had moved and wanted to eliminate their Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan was not because of their incompetence, but rather because they wanted to allow Chu Feng to train in the Martial Comprehension Ground.<br>The people of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan were left speechless by this. After all, it was the truth.<br>&ldquo;I am indeed in the wrong with this. However, Lord Ancestor did not explicitly state that we could not allow outsiders to use the Martial Comprehension Ground.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, Young Hero Chu Feng has helped us. As such, we wanted to repay him. That is the reason why we decided to allow him to train in the Martial Comprehension Ground. I hope that Lord War Sword will be willing to be lenient and give us an opportunity to reform ourselves.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, no matter how incompetent we might be, we are still descendants of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan.&rdquo;<br>The Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief spoke honestly. His tone was very humble. After he finished saying those words, he started kowtowing.<br>&ldquo;You dare quibble with me? Truly not even death can wipe away your crimes.&rdquo;<br>However, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword was simply deaf to the humble words. At that moment, the killing intent it emitted grew even stronger.<br>It was as if all the people of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan would die the very next moment.<br>&ldquo;Lord War Sword, we know our wrongs!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord War Sword, please spare us!&rdquo;<br>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;...<br>At that moment, the people from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan, including their clan chief and elders, all started to beg for forgiveness.<br>None of them wanted to die. Faced with certain death, they made their final struggle.<br>&ldquo;Wuuahh!!!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a powerful aura started to shroud them. It covered the bodies of all of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clansmen.<br>Like dying dogs, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clansmen were forced ruthlessly to the ground and were unable to move in the slightest. At that moment, they were unable to even speak.<br>Many people started to shed sorrowful tears of irreconciliation.<br>It was truly a tragic sight all around.<br>However, Chu Feng was unable to feel that oppressive might. It turned out that that oppressive might was only aimed at the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan's clansmen.<br>That Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword was only planning to kill the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clans men, and did not have the intention to attack Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Incompetent bunch, your deaths cannot be pitied.&rdquo;<br>That Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword spoke again. This time around, its voice contained killing intent capable of causing one to feel despair.<br>It was planning to attack and kill all of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan's men within the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan.<br>&ldquo;Wait a moment.&rdquo;<br>However, right at that moment, a voice was suddenly heard. Like a sudden clap of thunder, it exploded at that moment of despair.<br>It was Chu Feng. Chu Feng was the one who had spoken.<br><br></p></div>
