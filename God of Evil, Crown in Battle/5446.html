        <h1>Chapter 5446: The Ruler</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>The crowd instinctively knew that the light contained something, which prompted them to stare right into it.</span><br><span>Shoosh shoosh shoosh!</span><br><span>Scrolls suddenly began falling from the sky. They fell nicely into the juniors&rsquo; hands such that each person had a single scroll. There were exactly enough scrolls to go around.</span><br><span>The scrolls had runes floating around them, and they contained the same message content.</span><br><span>A surge of special energy would be descending from the sky shortly after, and the scroll was the container for storing that energy. Once the scroll accumulated sufficient energy, a formation would appear on the scroll. The more energy a scroll had, the stronger the formation would be.</span><br><span>The content of the trial was simple and straightforward.</span><br><span>The reward was simply the formation that would appear on the scroll, and the potency of the formation depended on how much energy one collected.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Painter, what kind of formation would appear on the scroll?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Many people outside were curious about the reward. As world spiritists, they carried an innate curiosity for formidable formations.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not too sure either. I am merely a spectator here,&rdquo; the World Spiritist Painter replied.</span><br><span>That further piqued the crowd&rsquo;s curiosity.</span><br><span>Hu hu hu!</span><br><span>A furious gale blew across the Infernal Realm. A massive congregation of energy swept in their direction and swiftly suffused the entire realm. This energy couldn&rsquo;t be used for cultivation, and it could only be channeled using the scroll the crowd had received earlier.</span><br><span>However, the instructions didn&rsquo;t clearly state how the scroll was to be used to collect the energy, so the juniors had to figure out that part by themselves.</span><br><span>Shortly after the energy suffused the entire realm, a massive projection of an incense stick appeared in the sky. It was quickly burning down, signaling that the juniors didn&rsquo;t have much time to collect the energy. It was likely that they would be evicted </span><span>from the Infernal Realm once the incense stick burned down.</span><br><span>Knowing that time was short, the crowd hurriedly examined their scrolls. There were no clear instructions, but they knew that the way to collect the energy was definitely inside the scroll.</span><br><span>Chu Feng did the same too, but unlike the panicked crowd, he examined the scroll with a leisurely gaze as if he was admiring a rare artwork.</span><br><span>Some of the more talented prodigies quickly uncovered the way to collect the energy through the scroll. They formed a series of hand seals, and energy started flowing into their scrolls.</span><br><span>The others were a little slower, but they soon discovered a solution too. Within a matter of moments, over twenty percent of the crowd had already begun channeling the surrounding energy into their scroll.</span><br><span>Perhaps due to the differences in the methods they had comprehended, there was a clear disparity in the rates at which the juniors were absorbing the energy. Judging from the time limit, it appeared that only ten percent of the juniors would be able to absorb enough energy to form the formation.</span><br><span>Soon, over thirty percent of the people present had uncovered the method to absorb the energy.</span><br><span>From the expressions of the remaining seventy percent of people, they seemed to have already given up on the trial. Since they couldn&rsquo;t even comprehend the method of absorbing the energy, there was no way they could obtain the fortuitous encounter here.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Why hasn&rsquo;t Chu Feng begun absorbing the energy yet?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The crowd was more interested in Chu Feng, the person who had triggered the Infernal Realm. They were surprised that Chu Feng hadn&rsquo;t begun absorbing the surrounding energy too, and it left them wondering if he was unable to decipher the method too.</span><br><span>How could he trigger the Infernal Realm if he couldn&rsquo;t even do this much? Is it really all luck?</span><br><span>Such were the thoughts harbored by the minority, but most people still thought that Chu Feng had his own plans.</span><br><span>Time swiftly passed. Half of the incense stick had already burned down.</span><br><span>Some of the juniors&rsquo; scrolls emanated a white glow reminiscent of the power of a White Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, and a dragon&rsquo;s roar could be heard from within. This was a sign that the formations had been successfully formed, but the juniors could continue channeling energy into the scroll and strive for a stronger formation.</span><br><span>The crowd&rsquo;s attention was still on Chu Feng.</span><br><span>The trial was already nearing the end, but Chu Feng still hadn&rsquo;t made a move. He was still looking at his scroll with leisurely eyes, but the crowd had begun doubting his capabilities. With the amount of time left, it was unlikely Chu Feng could form a formation even if he grasped the method now.</span><br><span>This was not an outcome the crowd had anticipated.</span><br><span>Many of the juniors were no longer looking at Chu Feng with eyes filled with </span><span>admiration. They had looked up to Chu Feng because they thought that he was cool for standing up against the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, but it would be all futile if he was nothing but empty talk.</span><br><span>A person with courage unbefitting of his strength was nothing but a fool. Who would respect a braggart?</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, is something wrong?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The World Spiritist Painter looked at Chu Feng in unease. He knew that this was a good chance for Chu Feng to forge his reputation, and he couldn&rsquo;t understand why Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t grasping this opportunity.</span><br><span>All of a sudden, Chu Feng began rolling up his scroll.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is he giving up?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The crowd muttered amongst themselves.</span><br><span>While the others were busy channeling energy into their scrolls, Chu Feng was stowing his scroll away. It was only normal for the crowd to think that he had given up.</span><br><span>Shoosh!</span><br><span>All of a sudden, Chu Feng tossed the scroll into the sky before forming a series of hand seals. The scroll froze in mid-air before abruptly expanding to over ten thousand times its original size.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Incredible! How did he do that?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Those juniors inside the Infernal Realm stared at Chu Feng&rsquo;s gigantic scroll in shock. They didn&rsquo;t even know that it was possible to do this with the scroll due to its peculiar nature. Just this feat was enough to make them aware of the vast disparity between them and Chu Feng.</span><br><span>Chu Feng changed his hand seals, and the scroll unfurled.</span><br><span>Before the scroll could fully open, a humongous amount of energy had already begun flowing into it like a tsunami. It took a brief moment for the scroll to glow with a brilliant white light, then the light quickly turned gray with a furious dragon&rsquo;s roar.</span><br><span>And the scroll was barely half-opened at this point. By the time the scroll was fully opened, it was already emitting blue light.</span><br><span>This was only the start. The humongous scroll was absorbing energy at a frightening rate that the light on the scroll swiftly changed.</span><br><span>Purple Dragon Mark, Golden Dragon Mark, Royal Dragon Mark&hellip;</span><br><span>By the time the scroll stopped absorbing the surrounding energy, it was already emanating a divine glow. It had reached Saint Dragon Mark!</span><br><span>One must know that the second strongest scroll to Chu Feng&rsquo;s had only reached Gray Dragon Mark at this point, and the vast majority of them were still at White Dragon Mark. It was such a striking contrast that the crowd was rendered dumbfounded. Putting aside the juniors, even those from the older generation could hardly believe their eyes.</span><br><span>While they had known that Chu Feng would achieve spectacular results, they didn&rsquo;t think that there would be such a huge difference between him and the other juniors. It left them wondering what kind of formation could be contained inside the scroll.</span><br><span>Even the World Spiritist Painter was excited by the turn of events.</span><br><span>The faces of those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect turned livid. It was one thing if they were the only ones here, but there were many other formidable powers from the Totem Galaxy here too. Yet, even the strongest prodigies of the Totem Galaxy paled in comparison to Chu Feng.</span><br><span>It was not that they were weak but that Chu Feng was too strong.</span><br><span>Not even the Pill Dao Immortal Sect was shameless enough to refute Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength anymore. It was an indisputable fact that Chu Feng was the ruler of the Infernal Realm!</span><br></p></div>
