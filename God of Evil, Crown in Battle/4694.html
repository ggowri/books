        <h1>Chapter 4693</h1>
        <div>: Tu Yuanyuan<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd felt conflicted at this situation as they had no idea what to make of this turn of events. Those who were ridiculing Chu Feng a moment ago swiftly fell silent.<br>No matter how foolish they were, it was as clear as day that the young man known as Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t as simple of a figure as they thought him out to be.<br>But again, common sense was not something universally common to everyone. There was one person who simply refused to accept reality.<br>&ldquo;This young miss over here, have you recognized the wrong person? That man over there is trash. He has merely induced white light from the stone platform earlier on.&rdquo;<br>Hua Xu landed right beside the rabbit-eared woman&rsquo;s side. It was as if he was afraid that she would be stolen from him that he began showing his unrefined side.<br>&ldquo;White glow? Are you talking about Chu Feng? That&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo; the woman refused to believe it.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true! If you don&rsquo;t believe me, you can ask everyone else. They saw it with their own eyes.&rdquo;<br>He gestured at the other juniors in the area who had been through the test, pressuring them to support his statement. Those juniors had already cleared the test and would be staying in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect in the long-term. Without a doubt, it would be in their best interest to be in Hua Xu&rsquo;s good books than to offend him.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, young miss. We saw it with our own eyes!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even though Chu Feng cleared the test, he only managed to induce white light. On the other hand, Brother Hua Xu has induced blue light.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re speaking the truth here. There&rsquo;s no mistaking it. If you don&rsquo;t believe us, you can ask him on your own!&rdquo;<br>The fervent support of the crowd pleased Hua Xu greatly.<br>However, the rabbit-eared woman didn&rsquo;t seem to be too receptive to their words. Instead, she turned to Hua Xu and asked, &ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you in the midst of a closed-door training before entering this place?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Indeed. I was found by Elder Qian in the midst of my closed-door training, which eventually brought me into the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect,&rdquo; Hua Xu replied.<br>&ldquo;The rest of you were in closed-door training too?&rdquo;<br>The rabbit-eared woman turned to the other juniors and asked.<br>&ldquo;Young miss, there&rsquo;s no need to ask that question. The juniors who have been brought in through the Hidden Dragon Heaven Formation were all in the midst of closed-door training.&rdquo;<br>The elder of the outer hall replied before the other juniors could answer.<br>&ldquo;I see. That explains it.&rdquo;<br>The rabbit-eared woman smiled in realization.<br>&ldquo;Those who have yet to be tested, hurry up and stand on top of the stone platform!&rdquo;<br>The elder from the North Tortoise Hall urged her hurriedly.<br>Everyone present had already taken the test, leaving just the rabbit-eared woman. While everyone had realized that this rabbit-eared woman was no ordinary person, the elder of the North Tortoise Hall wasn&rsquo;t the type to discriminate against others. He had no intention of giving her special privileges and wait for her.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, please wait for me.&rdquo;<br>The rabbit-eared girl winked at Chu Feng before leaping onto the stone platform.<br>Weng!<br>Soon, the first stone platform lit up with an outburst of purple light. She proceeded on to the other two stone platforms, and they emanated purple light too.<br>&ldquo;Purple light?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It really is! That&rsquo;s an indication of superior talent!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Elder Yu, congratulations on finding such an outstanding junior!&rdquo;<br>A huge commotion broke out once the test results were out. The elders present immediately began relaying their goodwill toward the Elder Yu who brought the rabbit-eared woman in.<br>Naturally, Elder Yu was also delighted by the results too, so much that he began crying out of joy. He probably hadn&rsquo;t thought that the junior he brought in would be this formidable too.<br>The elders of the North Tortoise Hall also began looking at the rabbit-eared woman in a new light too. If they could still remain nonchalant toward Hua Xu&rsquo;s blue light, the rabbit-eared woman&rsquo;s purple light had managed to break their composure.<br>Hua Xu&rsquo;s talent was enough to catch the eye of the East Dragon Hall, but the rabbit-eared woman&rsquo;s talent would make the elders of the East Dragon Hall actively recruit her.<br>&ldquo;Young miss, congratulations to you too. Someone of your talent will surely achieve great things in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect in the near future. May I know what your name is?&rdquo;<br>Hua Xu walked forward to congratulate the rabbit-eared woman, but unexpectedly, she ignored him and walked straight toward Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, my name is Tu Yuanyuan. We&rsquo;re going to be comrades in the same sect in the future, so please do remember my name,&rdquo; she said.<br>Tu Yuanyuan&rsquo;s action made Hua Xu direct a sharp glare at Chu Feng once more. He couldn&rsquo;t understand why she was so amicable to Chu Feng.<br>Given that he was in closed-door training while Chu Feng was causing huge ripples in the Holy Light Galaxy, it was only normal for him to not know about Chu Feng&rsquo;s exploits. On the other hand, Tu Yuanyuan clearly knew about Chu Feng&rsquo;s affairs, or else she wouldn&rsquo;t have been so friendly to him.<br>&ldquo;The selections is over. Those who have cleared the tests, please follow me.&rdquo;<br>The elders of the North Tortoise Hall instructed the juniors present before rising into the air. The juniors who had cleared the test swiftly stood up and followed them. Naturally, Chu Feng did the same too.<br>The elders led them through forests and mountains before finally arriving at an even more majestic square than before. A huge crowd was gathered on this square, and there were both elders and disciples alike.<br>Even though they were all inside the square, they were divided into four factions, as evidenced by the characters embroidered onto the robes.<br>The East Dragon Hall had the fewest people present, only a couple of elders and a few dozen disciples, whereas the North Tortoise Hall had the most people, around several hundred elders and a few thousand disciples.<br>Their clothes had the effect of severing detection measures, so unless they were to reveal their cultivation, Chu Feng was unable to tell how powerful they were.<br>However, there were always people who liked to flaunt their strength. Most people had chosen to conceal their cultivation, but there were still a small number of disciples who went around showing off their strength.<br>And through those who were openly displaying their strength, Chu Feng was able to get a rough gauge as to the prowess of the disciples of the four halls.<br>There was no doubt that the disciples of the East Dragon Hall were the strongest, but those who were showing their strength were only at pinnacle Exalted level. Of course, it was likely that there were stronger disciples who weren&rsquo;t revealing their cultivation.<br>As for the disciples from the other three halls, they were even weaker. In fact, in North Tortoise Hall, there were even disciples who were at Martial Immortal realm&hellip;<br></p></div>
