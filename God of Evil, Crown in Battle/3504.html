        <h1>Chapter 3503</h1>
        <div> - God-level Demon Suppression Formation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Senior, how did you determine that my big sister Liluo&rsquo;s disappearance is truly related to the Black-feathered Specter?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;When we discovered that letter, we also discovered another letter,&rdquo; As the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief spoke, he took out another letter.<br>Compared to the letter Bai Liluo had left for Chu Feng, that letter was very simple. It was merely a piece of white paper. Thirteen large characters were written on the white paper with blood.<br>&lsquo;I will have your Tantai Heavenly Clan forever be ill at ease.&rsquo;<br>Those words were very fierce and ugly. Furthermore, they contained killing intent.<br>Furthermore, there was a different aura present on the letter. It was an aura that originated from the Ancient Era. It was the Black-feathered Specter&rsquo;s aura.<br>&ldquo;Clan Chief Tantai, were these two letters found at the same place?&rdquo; Wuming Xingyun asked<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Furthermore&hellip; people have already begun to disappear from our clan. Furthermore, this was left at the place where they disappeared,&rdquo; As the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief spoke, he took out an item. It was none other than the Black-feathered Specter&rsquo;s feather.<br>&ldquo;Can we be certain that this is not a mischievous prank this time around?&rdquo; Wuming Xingyun asked.<br>&ldquo;Milord, you&rsquo;re a Saint-cloak World Spiritist. Do you think this is something that could be forged?&rdquo; the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked as he held the black feather in his hand.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, it doesn&rsquo;t apoear to be something one could forge. Unless&hellip; it&rsquo;s forged by a world spiritist with strength far surpassing my own. Otherwise, they cannot deceive my eyes,&rdquo; said Wuming Xingyun.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we have no choice but to confront the truth. Although it might sound very absurd, it has truly happened. The Black-feathered Specter that had disappeared for over ten thousand years has reappeared.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, I am ashamed to say that we ended up implicating that young lady this time around.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That young lady really shouldn&rsquo;t have joked around with the Black-feathered Specter,&rdquo; said the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Senior, you mean to say that because my big sister Liluo pretended to be the Black-feathered Specter, she ended up offending it, and was killed by it even though she&rsquo;s not from the Tantai Heavenly Clan?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;It is impossible to be certain of that. However, regardless of what it might really be, we will know the truth once we return to the clan,&rdquo; said the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Senior, do you have a way to handle this?&rdquo; The reason why Chu Feng asked this question was because he had discovered that the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was very confident. It seemed like he was already prepared for this.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, there is a way to handle this.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We must take care of this matter ahead of time. Otherwise, if this matter is to be known, it will bring panic to the people.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, Lord Wuming Xingyun, are you two willing to accompany me?&rdquo; asked the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; Chu Feng and Wuming Xingyun replied in unison.<br>Then, Chu Feng and Wuming Xingyun accompanied the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the peak experts of the Tantai Heavenly Clan and left the warship. They rushed to the Tantai Heavenly Clan ahead of them.<br>On their way to the Tantai Heavenly Clan, the Clan Chief began to inform Chu Feng and Wuming Xingyun of the method he had in mind for dealing with the Black-feathered Specter.<br>&hellip;&hellip;<br>&hellip;...<br>Back then, when the Tantai Heavenly Clan was being subjected to the Black-feathered Specter&rsquo;s terror, it was as the rumors had said; they had resigned themselves to fate.<br>Because of that, the Tantai Heavenly Clan had been thinking about a way to deal with the Black-feathered Specter the entire time.<br>However, the Black-feathered Specter would come and go without a trace. The Tantai Heavenly Clan was unable to even confront it head-on. They could only watch helplessly as their clansmen continued to disappear.<br>Later on, by pure coincidence, the Tantai Heavenly Clan had encountered an expert from another starfield. That expert taught the Tantai Heavenly Clan a method to capture the Black-feathered Specter.<br>For the sake of killing the Black-feathered Specter, the Tantai Heavenly Clan spent a hundred years just on preparations.<br>Although the Black-feathered Specter had suddenly disappeared in the third year after it&rsquo;s appearance, even though the Tantai Heavenly Clan had no idea why it had suddenly disappeared, they also did not know whether it would reappear or not.<br>Thus, to take precautions against the reappearance of the Black-feathered Specter causing chaos in their clan, the Tantai Heavenly Clan followed the instructions of that expert, and set up the method to capture and kill the Black-feathered Specter.<br>The method was actually using a treasure to set up a grand demon suppression formation.<br>The demon suppression formation covered the entire Tantai Heavenly Clan. As for the treasure, it was something that expert passed on to the Tantai Heavenly Clan.<br>As long as the Black-feathered Specter was within range of the grand demon suppression formation, the formation would be able to lock onto its location. Furthermore, it was also capable of killing it.<br>Unfortunately, although the grand demon suppression formation was completed in a hundred years, the Black-feathered Specter never reappeared.<br>Furthermore, the grand demon suppression formation could only be activated once.<br>After it was activated, it would practically exhaust the treasure left behind by that expert. With that, the grand formation would lose its power. Because of that, the grand demon suppression formation had never been activated.<br>Because of that, no one had experienced the might of the grand demon suppression formation before.<br>That said, never did anyone expect the Black-feathered Specter to reappear. Finally, the grand demon suppression formation would come in handy. Finally, it would be able to unleash its might.<br>&hellip;&hellip;<br>&hellip;...<br>With the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, an Utmost Exalted-level expert, leading the way, Chu Feng and the others traveled very fast. They far surpassed the speed of the warships.<br>Soon, they returned to the Tantai Heavenly Clan.<br>Furthermore, they arrived at an underground palace.<br>This underground palace was not exquisite at all. It could be said to be very simply decorated. However, it was very large, so large that one would feel reverence toward it.<br>Although the entrance to the underground palace was tightly shut, a powerful aura was being given off from the entrance.<br>If one were to insist on describing the aura, then it would be &lsquo;overwhelming&rsquo;. Sensing that aura, one would feel a sense of security. It was as if no evil monsters would be able to approach that place should the aura be present.<br>There was no signboard above the underground palace. Instead, there was a title plate.<br>The title plate was very large. It was seventy-three meters wide and a hundred and one meters long.<br>Four words were inscribed on the title plate - &lsquo;Evil Suppression, Demon Repression&rsquo;.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s attention was immediately captured by the title plate. The title plate was formed with spirit power. Furthermore, the strength of that spirit power was very strong. It actually surpassed that of a Saint-cloak World Spiritist.<br>It was not only Chu Feng whose attention was captured by it. Wuming Xingyun also had an astonished expression as his eyes were deeply captured by the title plate, unable to move away.<br>As a Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, he was naturally able to sense how powerful the spirit power within that title plate was.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that the two of you are both able to sense it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The expert that our clan&rsquo;s seniors encountered back then was a God-cloak World Spiritist.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for this title plate, it was bestowed to us by that expert,&rdquo; the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;What else is there apart from this title plate?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;There are twelve banners in addition to the title plate. Those twelve banners also contain God-level spirit power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;According to that expert, the twelve banners, together with this title plate, will be able to compose the grand demon suppression formation,&rdquo; the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;In other words, this grand demon suppression formation is actually the technique of a God-cloak World Spiritist?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s precisely the case. It is also precisely because that expert&rsquo;s abilities are so powerful that I am confident that we will definitely be able to eliminate the Black-feathered Specter should it still be in our clan,&rdquo; said the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br></p></div>
