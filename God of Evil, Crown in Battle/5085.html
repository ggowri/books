        <h1>Chapter 5084</h1>
        <div>: The Victor Has Been Decided<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wang Yuxian, the Lady of Dao Sea, and the others sent voice transmissions to Chu Feng to tell him to leave this place. Chu Feng initially ignored them, and it was only till Jiang Yuantai took out those wooden weapons once more that he finally answered them.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I won&rsquo;t lose today,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied confidently.<br>His response left Jiang Yuantai feeling even more displeased.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, talk is cheap. If you&rsquo;re ready, I&rsquo;m going to make a move now. Remember, I won&rsquo;t go easy on you this time around. If you lose, you die,&rdquo; Jiang Yuantai said.<br>He wasn&rsquo;t joking here. He was really intending to take Chu Feng&rsquo;s life.<br>&ldquo;Come then. I just fear that you&rsquo;re overestimating your capabilities,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a disdainful smile.<br>It was as if Jiang Yuantai meant nothing to him at all. This made the already infuriated Jiang Yuantai even angrier.<br>Shoosh!<br>Jiang Yuantai bolted forth in a streak of light, rushing toward Chu Feng in a series of sonic booms.<br>Despite Chu Feng&rsquo;s earlier cheery attitude, his eyes immediately became serious as soon as Jiang Yuantai made a move. He raised the sword in his hand and counterattacked.<br>Shoosh shoosh shoosh!<br>To Jiang Yuantai&rsquo;s sword, Chu Feng brandished his single sword as if he had an army of swords in his possession. It felt almost as if swords were raining down on him. Even so, he wasn&rsquo;t intimidated in the least. He flung his spear with great agility and deflected all of Chu Feng&rsquo;s attacks.<br>He didn&rsquo;t spend decades training his spearmanship in vain, after all.<br>After blocking the attack, Jiang Yuantai quickly followed up with an attack of his own. Chu Feng saw it, but he chose to further his aggression instead of going on the defensive. Just like that, the two of them began trading blows.<br>&ldquo;Formidable!&rdquo;<br>Those who were present had seen the two of them trading blows before, but they were still awed by the sight. Neither of them was holding back at all, causing the duel to be intense right from the start. Both sides appeared to be equally matched, which only further added to the hype.<br>&ldquo;Why does it seem like Chu Feng has gotten weaker? No, that&rsquo;s not it. It looks like he&rsquo;s weaker than before, but his movements are much faster than before. What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Jiang Kongping murmured under his breath.<br>As Chu Feng and Jiang Yuantai had suppressed their cultivation to rank four Martial Exalted level, Jiang Kongping was able to spectate the details of the duel without any trouble. He could tell that Chu Feng&rsquo;s attacks were less powerful than before, which should have put him at a disadvantage. However, that wasn&rsquo;t the case at all.<br>&ldquo;His swordsmanship has gotten more delicate and profound than before. That&rsquo;s compensating for the decrease in his fighting prowess. But this doesn&rsquo;t make sense. Why would his fighting prowess be lowered all of a sudden?<br>&ldquo;He must be doing it intentionally. He&rsquo;s feigning weakness so that he can launch a surprise attack. That brat is as despicable as ever!&rdquo;<br>Having thought of that, Jiang Taibai quickly sent a voice transmission to Jiang Yuantai.<br>&ldquo;Young master Yuantai, Chu Feng is preserving his strength to launch a surprise assault on you. You mustn&rsquo;t give him an opportunity to strike. It&rsquo;ll be best if you can end this battle as soon as possible!&rdquo; Jiang Taibai advised.<br>In truth, Chu Feng was already as good as dead. Regardless of whether he won this battle or not, there was no way he was getting out of here. However, those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect cared a lot for their reputation, such that even if all of the cultivators from the Eastern Region were to die today, they still desired to achieve a beautiful victory.<br>Jiang Yuantai could also tell that Chu Feng was withholding his true strength. Knowing that it could get dangerous at this rate, he pushed his spear forward with much greater strength and speed than before. At the same time, the prowess of his spear formation grew by leaps and bounds.<br>Considering that the two of them were equally matched earlier, Chu Feng should have been hard-pressed to deal with Jiang Yuantai&rsquo;s sudden increment in strength. Yet, Chu Feng was somehow still able to cope with Jiang Yuantai&rsquo;s aggression.<br>To be more exact, Chu Feng was exerting more strength and moving faster than before, but not by much. At the very least, it was marginal compared to Jiang Yuantai&rsquo;s explosive increase. Yet, he was still holding his own against Jiang Yuantai.<br>The reason for that was Chu Feng&rsquo;s profound swordsmanship.<br>He was able to read Jiang Yuantai&rsquo;s attack, allowing him to stand his ground against Jiang Yuantai even when there was a decisive disadvantage in terms of strength and speed.<br>&ldquo;That fellow!&rdquo;<br>Jiang Yuantai was displeased to see that his attack wasn&rsquo;t working even after he had consumed a forbidden medicine. Chu Feng had put on an arrogant attitude right from the start as if this battle was his for the taking, which made Jiang Yuantai more determined than ever to crush him. Yet, for some reason, he hadn&rsquo;t been able to clinch the upper hand ever since the start of the battle.<br>&ldquo;I guess the white pill won&rsquo;t be enough for you. Why don&rsquo;t you consume the gray one too?&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You?!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s words astonished Jiang Yuantai, Jiang Kongping, and everyone from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. They were naturally aware that Jiang Yuantai had consumed two forbidden medicines the previous time they crossed blows, but they were confident that no one else was aware of it since the forbidden medicine wouldn&rsquo;t alter one&rsquo;s aura.<br>Yet, Chu Feng actually knew!<br>&ldquo;Could it be that&hellip;?&rdquo;<br>Jiang Kongping frowned as a possibility surfaced in his mind.<br>Shoosh shoosh shoosh!<br>While Jiang Yuantai was still in a daze, Chu Feng&rsquo;s sword moved with even greater speed.<br>Pu!<br>There was a spurt of fresh blood, and everyone fell silent. Chu Feng&rsquo;s sword also came to a halt, for it had severed Jiang Yuantai&rsquo;s right arm along with the spear it was holding.<br>The victor for this duel had been determined!<br></p></div>
