        <h1>Chapter 4661</h1>
        <div>: Burst Out In Laughter<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, you must hold the end of your promise. You mustn&rsquo;t kill me.&rdquo;<br>Gongsun Yuntian was oblivious to what Chu Feng had just gone through. When he noticed that he had returned back to the same hall as before, an ominous premonition arose in his heart.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, I, Chu Feng, am a man of my words. Since I said that I wouldn&rsquo;t kill you, I wouldn&rsquo;t do so. Here, take this.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng passed a golden box to Gongsun Yuntina as he spoke.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, this&hellip; what do you mean by this?&rdquo;<br>Gongsun Yuntian looked at the golden box, which surface was filled with inscriptions, as he asked in incomprehension. He couldn&rsquo;t understand what Chu Feng was up to.<br>&ldquo;This is the item which Lord Black Demon wants us to bring back. I&rsquo;ll be frank with you; the reason why I participated in the matchmaking convention was just so I can take a look around the Asura Graveyard. I&rsquo;ve no interest in Lord Black Demon&rsquo;s granddaughter at all. Since I&rsquo;ve already achieved my goal, I&rsquo;ll leave it to you to give this box to Lord Black Demon,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Of course, Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t possibly be that kind-hearted.<br>This golden box was not the same as the one he swiped from the Asura King Palace. Instead, it was something he spent some time constructing while escaping from the Asura King Palace.<br>Upon hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words, Gongsun Yuntian began assessing the box silently. He realized that the box was made out of a unique material that made it impossible to see what was inside.<br>But while the material did block off spirit power, it wasn&rsquo;t exactly resilient. In other words, it was possible to break it with brute strength. However, the complicated inscriptions on its surface suggested that there was a formation or some sort of mechanism embedded in the box.<br>One who sought to open the box would have to follow the steps properly, or else one could end up triggering a fearsome formation.<br>Seeing how enigmatic the box was, Gongsun Yuntian felt that it was possible for it to be the real thing. Needless to say, he was unaware that it was just some trickery on Chu Feng&rsquo;s part.<br>He intentionally made the box look all enigmatic and mysterious because he knew that neither Gongsun Yuntian and the Wretched Black Demon would dare to get careless with the box.<br>If they were to use brute force, they could simply pry the box open easily. However, if they had to decipher it using Chu Feng&rsquo;s method, putting aside Gongsun Yuntian, even the Wretched Black Demon would take quite some time.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, are you intending to give me the credit?&rdquo; Gongsun Yuntian asked.<br>By this point in time, he was already starting to trust Chu Feng&rsquo;s words. After all, there was no reason for Chu Feng to keep him alive just to play a prank on him.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not giving you the credit. I&rsquo;m just handing the item over to the person who needs it the most,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, this&hellip; How can I ever repay you?&rdquo; Gongsun Yuntian replied in gratitude.<br>&ldquo;If you feel thankful to me, why don&rsquo;t you hand over all of the treasures you have?&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he glanced at Gongsun Yuntian&rsquo;s Cosmos Sack.<br>&ldquo;Ah? This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The tone which Chu Feng was using made it seem as if he was demanding Gongsun Yuntian&rsquo;s bag instead of asking for it.<br>&ldquo;Why? Are you unwilling to hand it over to me? Do you need Milady Queen to have a talk with you about this?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with narrowed eyes.<br>&ldquo;No no no, Brother Chu Feng. Given the favor you have shown me, it&rsquo;s only right for me to give it to you. Here.&rdquo;<br>Without any hesitation, Gongsun Yuntian immediately passed his Cosmos Sack over to Chu Feng before imparting the way to open the Cosmos Sack to him. Aside from that, he also handed over the treasures he had hidden on his body over as well.<br>The Cosmos Sack was the Gongsun Clan&rsquo;s property. If Gongsun Yuntian hadn&rsquo;t taught Chu Feng not to open it, Chu Feng would really have a hard time trying to pry it open.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, there are still three pieces of Summoned Jadehearts in here. You mustn&rsquo;t tell others that I was the one who gave it to you. Otherwise, our Gongsun Clan will face a calamity,&rdquo; Gongsun Yuntian said.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng swiftly checked the contents of the Cosmos Sack and saw that there was really plenty of good stuff in there. It was just a pity that not much of it was useful to him.<br>If he really had to narrow it down, the only things that were really significant were just the three Summoned Jadehearts.<br>He had witnessed the power of the Summoned Jadehearts before, and it was truly formidable. In a scenario where the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk was unwilling to help him, the Summoned Jadehearts could prove to be an invaluable weapon to him.<br>&ldquo;Alright, since we&rsquo;ve settled things here, let&rsquo;s hurry out.&rdquo;<br>After keeping the Cosmos Sack, Chu Feng urged Gongsun Yuntian to leave.<br>While this place was remote, Chu Feng knew that it was only a matter of time before the Asura Evil Spirits found this place. Thus, he dared not to stay here for too long.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, please wait a moment. I was imprisoned during this period of time, so I still don&rsquo;t know how you managed to obtain the box. Please share the procedure with me so that I can be accountable to Lord Black Demon,&rdquo; Gongsun Yuntian said.<br>&ldquo;You just have to remember that it&rsquo;s someone named Lord Yunliang who led us to the box. I&rsquo;ll fill in the details. We should hurry up and leave. The Asura Evil Spirits are out for us at the moment. If they were to get their hands on us, we&rsquo;ll surely die a tragic death,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo;<br>Upon hearing that the Asura Evil Spirits were currently hunting them, Gongsun Yuntian dared not to say anything more and hurriedly stepped into the spirit formation gate.<br>Right after entering the spirit formation gate, Chu Feng and Gongsun Yuntian soon found themselves returning back to the humongous hall they had entered at the very start.<br>The Wretched Black Demon was still in this humongous hall, sitting in the core of the equally humongous formation. From the looks of it, it appeared as if he hadn&rsquo;t left this place at all.<br>As soon as he saw that Chu Feng and Gongsun Yuntian had returned, he quickly deactivated the humongous formation before walking up to them.<br>&ldquo;Young friends, did you manage to acquire the item?&rdquo;<br>Nervousness could be seen on the Wretched Black Demon&rsquo;s old face.<br>&ldquo;Lord Black Demon, we have managed to obtain it, but&hellip; the one who did the deed was Gongsun Yuntian,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Yuntian, did you really manage to obtain it?&rdquo;<br>The Wretched Black Demon looked at Gongsun Yuntian with an agitated look on his face.<br>&ldquo;Yes, Lord Black Demon. Here is the item.&rdquo;<br>Not daring to keep the Wretched Black Demon waiting, Gongsun Yuntian quickly took out the golden box and presented it to him.<br>The Wretched Black Demon quickly took the box and began to examine it carefully. A short moment later, a doubtful frown appeared on his face.<br>This box was different from what he had envisioned.<br>If he really had to put it in words, it looked too shabby.<br>Other than the fact that it blocked off spirit power, the box was so flimsy that it could have very well been made out of paper.<br>&ldquo;Are you sure that this is it? Is there no mistake here?&rdquo; the Wretched Black Demon asked Gongsun Yuntian.<br>With the Wretched Black Demon posing such a question to him, Gongsun Yuntian began to hesitate a little, not knowing how he should answer. He began turning his sights to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Milord, there&rsquo;s no mistake here. This is the very box which Lord Yunliang told us to retrieve from the Asura King Palace in the Asura Graveyard. The Asura Evil Spirits of the Asura Graveyard had to pay a heavy price before they were able to activate it on the formation of the King&rsquo;s Stand.<br>&ldquo;However, in the midst of the operation, Lord Yunliang ended up exposing himself, and I&rsquo;m afraid that&hellip; he probably wouldn&rsquo;t survive the turmoil,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a hint of sorrow in his voice.<br>The sorrow he felt for Lord Yunliang was sincere. Even though the time they had spent with one another was short, there was no denying that Lord Yunliang had offered him plenty of help.<br>It was very likely that Lord Yunliang was already dead by now.<br>But to Chu Feng&rsquo;s surprise, the Wretched Black Demon wasn&rsquo;t upset upon hearing Lord Yunliang&rsquo;s death at all. On the contrary, he burst into hearty laughter.<br></p></div>
