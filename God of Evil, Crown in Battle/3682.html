        <div> - Extremely Shocking<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the crowd recognized that it was indeed Chu Feng, they felt extremely shocked.<br>The surroundings became strangely quiet. The crowd had been startled speechless by the scene before them.<br>Even though many among them had heard the rumors of Chu Feng battling Linghu Hongfei to a tie and obtaining the title of the first ranked of the Ancestral Martial Decastars together with him, even though no one had doubted his talent, there were rank three Exalted among the five hundred plus experts who had been killed.<br>Those rank three Exalted were actually killed instantly by Chu Feng with only a single attack, much like the Martial Immortals present.<br>With this, how could they not be astonished?<br>It was not only the people of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm that were astonished. Even the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were astonished by Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength.<br>The speed of his growth was simply too fast. It seemed to them that everytime they were separated from him, he became stronger the next time they met him.<br>However, upon thinking about it, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen began feeling distressed.<br>It was not only them. Even the spectators from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm began to feel distressed and regret upon seeing Chu Feng standing before the Chu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>Without a doubt, Chu Feng was truly a demon-level genius. If he were allowed to continue to grow, he might even surpass his father. It might even be possible for him to stand at the summit of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, and become an expert of the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>Unfortunately, a rare genius like Chu Feng always ended up dying.<br>Would such a genius reappear in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm?<br>Thinking of that, the crowd started feeling very upset.<br>&ldquo;Interesting. As expected of Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son, your ruthlessness is truly not something that a person of the younger generation should possess.&rdquo;<br>The experts from the Blood-devouring Hall looked at the remains of the five hundred plus experts that Chu Feng had killed. They showed no sympathy, and had a look as if seemingly saying that they deserved their deaths.<br>&ldquo;Why did you all attack our Chu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng had just returned. The first thing he saw was that his Chu Heavenly Clan was being besieged by those people. However, he did not know what caused all of this. Even though he had some guesses as to the reason for it, he was unable to be certain. That was why he had asked the question.<br>&ldquo;Why? It&rsquo;s naturally because of your father.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Your father killed my entire family. Thus, I&rsquo;m going to extinguish your entire Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The debt of the father shall be paid by the son. That is only right and proper.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, furious roars sounded nonstop from the crusading army.<br>Those voices were not only filled with deep killing intent, but they were also filled with intense hatred.<br>&ldquo;What about you all?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do you also possess conflicts with my father?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng ignored the small fry and turned his gaze to the eight experts from the Blood-devouring Hall.<br>Chu Feng knew that the eight of them were the real threat to his Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;We do not possess any conflict with your father. We have only come here today because we were paid to take care of some business,&rdquo; said the leader of the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s eight.<br>&ldquo;In that case, compared to those people, you eight are even more deserving to die,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo; Hearing those words, the eight Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s experts burst into loud laughter.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, we deserve to die. We have killed too many people who shouldn&rsquo;t have died. Unfortunately, the ones to die today are not us. Instead, it will be you&hellip;&rdquo; said an expert from the Blood-devouring Hall.<br>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled. Then, he said, &ldquo;For every grievance someone is responsible, for every debt there is a debtor. Since my father is no longer here, settle your debts with me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Go ahead and kill me. However, spare my clansmen. Is that fine?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you must not!&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, many people from the Chu Heavenly Clan shouted at Chu Feng.<br>They naturally did not wish for him to die protecting them.<br>If that were to happen, they would feel extremely guilty and ashamed.<br>&ldquo;You are truly acting like a hero. Do you not fear death?&rdquo; asked an expert from the Blood-devouring Hall.<br>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You do? You&rsquo;re actually saying you fear death? I cannot see the slightest trace of fear from you. You're even more calm and collected than those so-called elders of your Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>That Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s expert&rsquo;s words were filled with mockery.<br>The Chu Heavenly Clansmen were all terrified. It was obvious for those that were crying in fear. As for those who were not crying, they still had looks of not wanting to die.<br>Fear. Cowardice. Craven for life. They were all vivid on the faces of many Chu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>It would be one thing if it was only those from the younger generation. However, even those of the older generation, even those elders, were acting that way.<br>Logically, it was natural for them to be afraid when encountering the calamity of having their entire clan exterminated.<br>However, it just so happened that a person of the younger generation like Chu Feng, showed no fear on his face, even when confronted with death. Instead, he was very calm.<br>This created a clear contrast, and made the majority of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen appear extremely weak.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you are truly different. However, you are mistaken about this matter. Although our target is you, that doesn't mean that we will spare your Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You are not the one who gets to decide this matter. Instead, it's us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You can go and ask them. Are they willing to leave behind future worries, or would they rather eliminate the roots completely?&rdquo; said that expert from the Blood-devouring Hall.<br>&ldquo;The Chu Heavenly Clan has done countless atrocities! Not a single person can be spared!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! Slaughter all the trash! That would be eliminating evil from the Ancestral Martial Starfield!&rdquo;<br>Some among the crowd were gnashing their teeth angrily as they said those words. Others were taking delight in the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s calamity. They even spoke of the Chu Heavenly Clan as an evildoing power, wicked beyond redemption.<br>However, none of those things were important. What was important was that they were determined to massacre the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, do you see that? It&rsquo;s not that we do not wish to spare your clansmen, it&rsquo;s simply the will of the public, and we're unable to do anything about it,&rdquo; said that Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s expert.<br>Seeing the vicious looks on the faces of the eight from the Blood-devouring Hall and the people that stood behind them, Chu Feng felt extremely angry.<br>If the Evil God Sword wasn&rsquo;t sealed by the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted, how could he possibly fear those people?<br>Unfortunately, since the power of the Evil God Sword was sealed, Chu Feng could only rely on himself.<br>That said, he would not admit defeat so easily either.<br></p></div>
