        <h1>Chapter 2950</h1>
        <div> - Massive Misfortune<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s territory was truly enormous.<br>Even though Chu Xingde, a peak Martial Immortal, was guiding Chu Feng, it still took them a lot of time to finally arrive at the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s main city.<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s main city was not an extremely dazzling place befitting of a ruler. Instead&hellip; it was a very magical place.<br>The main city was located in the sky. It was composed of over ten thousand smaller cities interconnected with one another.<br>When looking at it from afar, it was simply a sea of cities with no limit to be seen.<br>At this place where white clouds float, at this place where red-crowned cranes fly, were countless cities of all different shapes. The main city was very majestic. It had completely stunned Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng had to admit that the Chu Heavenly Clan was truly worthy of being the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s overlord.<br>Merely the main city was enough to astonish even Chu Feng. Even though Chu Feng had witnessed a lot of different cities, he had never witnessed constructions as magnificent as this.<br>From this, it could be seen that the Chu Heavenly Clan must&rsquo;ve put forth a lot of effort into their main city.<br>&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo;<br>Before Chu Feng could even approach the main city, a loud shout sounded from afar.<br>Following that, an army over a thousand men began to fly toward Chu Feng, Chu Xingde and Chu Xingren.<br>In the end, they stopped before Chu Feng and formed a wall in the sky, sealing off their path.<br>From their outfits, it could be seen that they were all people from the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Furthermore, they all had an identical title plate on their waists. That title plate read &lsquo;Military Hall.&rsquo;<br>&ldquo;What audacity! You mere people of the younger generation dare to stop us brothers?!&rdquo;<br>Seeing this, Chu Xingde immediately revealed an angry look. Chu Feng was even able to feel a chilly sensation from him.<br>Chu Xingde unleashed his oppressive might. Even Chu Feng was able to sense his oppressive might. Those people from the Chu Heavenly Clan that had stopped them were shivering. They were deeply frightened by the oppressive might.<br>&ldquo;Brother Xingde, please don&rsquo;t get angry.&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, another figure flew over and landed before the wall of people. When he landed, the thousand plus people that were shivering immediately eased up.<br>The person who had landed was a middle-aged looking man. His skin was very white. However, his eyes were extremely cold and sinister. He belonged to the sort of people that one could tell was dangerous from a single glance.<br>Furthermore, he was able to block Chu Xingde&rsquo;s oppressive might. This indicated that his strength was extraordinary. At the very least&hellip; his cultivation should also be that of a peak Martial Immortal.<br>Furthermore, this person also had the title plate of the Military Hall on his waist.<br>&ldquo;Chu Moqiong, who gave your Military Hall the nerve to block our Law Enforcement Hall?!&rdquo; Chu Xingde spoke in a displeased manner.<br>Even though that man&rsquo;s cultivation was not inferior to their own, Chu Xingde and Chu Xingren does not possess any fear when they looked to him. On the contrary&hellip; the two of them did not place that man in their eyes.<br>However, that Chu Moqiong also did not place Chu Xingde and Chu Xingren in his eyes. He smiled with contempt, and then said, &ldquo;Brother Xingde, you&rsquo;re overthinking things. We are family, how could I block you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In that case, what are you doing bringing this bunch along with you?&rdquo; Chu Xingren asked.<br>&ldquo;The person I am blocking is not the two of you,&rdquo; Chu Moqiong pointed to Chu Feng, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This Chu Feng is requested back at the Law Enforcement Hall by Lord Zhengfa, you dare to stop him?&rdquo; Chu Xingde asked.<br>&ldquo;I am truly apologetic. It is not me who wants to stop Chu Feng. Instead, it is Lord Hanpeng who wanted me to stop Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Moqiong spoke, he flipped his palm, and a title plate appeared in his hand.<br>The center of that title plate read &lsquo;Supreme Elder.&rsquo;<br>The lower right corner read &lsquo;Chu Hanpeng.&rsquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Supreme Elder left his closed-door training?!&rdquo; Chu Xingde and Chu Xingren immediately started frowning.<br>As members of the Chu Heavenly Clan, they knew very well who Chu Hanpeng was.<br>Chu Hanpeng was someone from the same era as Chu Hanxian and the current Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>Although Chu Hanxian was deemed to be the strongest genius of his era, the current Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and Chu Hanpeng were also extremely dreadful existences.<br>Back then, the three of them were praised as &lsquo;Chu&rsquo;s Three Prides&rsquo;.<br>After Chu Hanxian disappeared, Chu Hanpeng and the current Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief became the strongest geniuses of the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>In fact, Chu Hanpeng was one of the candidates in the competition to become the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>Although he ended up being defeated by the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s current Clan Chief, Chu Hanpeng was so powerful that he became the strongest of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s nine Supreme Elders.<br>He was publicly accepted to be the second strongest expert in the Chu Heavenly Clan right now.<br>Most importantly, Chu Hanpeng was the Military Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master all the way up until he became an Supreme Elder. Thus, he possessed special sentiments toward the Military Hall. After he became an Supreme Elder, he had always remained the Military Hall&rsquo;s backing.<br>And now, he had exited his closed-door training. This was not a good thing for the Law Enforcement Hall at all.<br>This was even worse news for Chu Feng.<br>Faced with someone of Chu Hanpeng&rsquo;s status, not to mention Chu Xuanzhengfa, even Chu Xuanzhengfa&rsquo;s father, the current Hall Master of the Law Enforcement Hall, would have to give Chu Hanpeng face.<br>&ldquo;Thus, you all should forget about worrying for that Chu Feng. Instead, you should worry about your Lord Zhengfa.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although he is the Law Enforcement Hall&rsquo;s Vice Hall Master, he, a person of the younger generation, dared to act out against his seniors at the Four Halls Main Palace. That is a major offense in the Chu Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; Chu Moqiong said.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Xingde and Chu Xingren&rsquo;s expressions grew even uglier.<br>They knew what Chu Moqiong was referring to.<br>When Chu Feng had just grown famous due to what had happened in the Immortal Armament Villa, Chu Xuanzhengfa called for a gathering of the Military Hall, World Spirit Hall and Treasure Hall&rsquo;s Hall Masters to discuss if they should bring Chu Feng back into the clan and nurture him with emphasis should he be Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son.<br>However, the three Hall Masters had revealed extreme contempt and an unyielding attitude at Chu Xuanzhengfa. Because of this, Chu Xuanzhengfa unleashed his oppressive might and suppressed his three seniors on the spot.<br>Those three old farts were all narrow-minded individuals. Now that Chu Hanpeng had left his closed-door training, they would naturally go and bring forth the accusation against Chu Xuanzhengfa to Chu Hanpeng.<br>Furthermore, with Chu Hanpeng&rsquo;s character, he would definitely not let this opportunity to teach Chu Xuanzhengfa a lesson slip by.<br>This time around, it might really end up as Chu Moqiong said. Chu Xuanzhengfa might end up suffering a massive misfortune.<br><br><br></p></div>
