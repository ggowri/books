        <div> - The Scheme of the Immortal Execution Archipelago<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Senior Qiushui, what is it?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s related to the Crippling Night Demon Sect. I wasn&rsquo;t planning to tell you because nothing good will stem out of this. I was afraid you&rsquo;d be rash.<br>&ldquo;However, you are still a member of the Crippling Night Demon Sect. After some contemplation, I decided it was better to tell you,&rdquo; Qiushui Fuyan said.<br>&ldquo;Senior Qiushui, what happened?&rdquo; Chu Feng felt a bit uneasy, and subconsciously knew that they were in a bit of trouble.<br>&ldquo;The battle between the Immortal Execution Archipelago and the Crippling Night Demon Sect has completely spread far and wide. Both sides are fighting back and forth, and both sides have been wounded. However, since the Crippling Night Demon Sect has always been hidden, the ones suffering have always been the Immortal Execution Archipelago.<br>&ldquo;As I was searching for Huangfu Haoyue, I inadvertently stumbled upon a meeting between the Immortal Execution Archipelago and the Inferno Divine Bird clan.<br>&ldquo;Both sides typically don&rsquo;t have any dealings with each other. However, the Immortal Execution Archipelago has sent an alliance invitation to the Three Great Monstrous Clans, inviting them to deal with the Crippling Night Demon Sect together. The Inferno Divine Bird clan is one of the Three Great Monstrous Clans.<br>&ldquo;When I saw them together, my first thought was the possibility they had already allied together. These two enormous powers were going to fight the Crippling Night Demon Sect together.<br>&ldquo;So, I secretly snuck in and eavesdropped on their conversation.<br>&ldquo;Their plans matched my expectation. They had truly allied, and they were planning a counterattack towards the Crippling Night Demon Sect,&rdquo; Qiushui Fuyan said.<br>&ldquo;What are they planning to do?&rdquo; Chu Feng suddenly stood up. He could not continue just sitting there, because regardless what others said, he was still a member of the Crippling Night Demon Sect. He couldn&rsquo;t just do nothing as the Crippling Night Demon Sect was in danger.<br>&ldquo;There are a limited number of experts in the Immortal Execution Archipelago. At present, battles are erupting frequently so all Martial Kings from the Immortal Execution Archipelago are overseeing a single region of land, guarding important territories.<br>&ldquo;The Crippling Night Demon Sect knows that well, so they don&rsquo;t attack any territories guarded by Martial Kings. They send experts to attack places with no Martial Kings. Although it&rsquo;s a bit despicable, it has made the Immortal Execution Archipelago suffer greatly.<br>&ldquo;Right now, the Immortal Execution Archipelago is planning to use that tactic to counterattack. They&rsquo;ve intentionally let out news that Murong Xun and some experts left the Immortal Execution Archipelago, thus attracting an attack from the Crippling Night Demon Sect.<br>&ldquo;The sect has always kept a close eye on the Immortal Execution Archipelago&rsquo;s Martial Kings. After confirming none have been sent, they are definitely going to ambush Murong Xun.<br>&ldquo;However, they will not know there are two Martial Kings from the Inferno Divine Bird clan hidden within the group led by Murong Xun.<br>&ldquo;Those two Martial King Monstrous Beasts are really not simple at all. They are the two Protectors of the Inferno Divine Bird clan. Although they are only rank one Martial Kings, they possess a bloodline power only Monstrous Beasts have. They also have an extremely strong combination technique, and a typical Martial King cannot defend against that.<br>&ldquo;If your Crippling Night Demon Sect is truly going to send experts, then it would be somewhat fine if they send two Martial King. However, if they only send one, it will be suicidal.<br>&ldquo;And, if your Crippling Night Demon Sect hasn&rsquo;t discovered this will be a trap, they will definitely only send one.<br>&ldquo;So, it&rsquo;s best that you notify them and tell them to avoid falling into the trap,&rdquo; Qiushui Fuyan said.<br>&ldquo;Crap!&rdquo; Chu Feng instantly furrowed his brows tightly, then said, &ldquo;They can contact me, but I can&rsquo;t contact them, nor do I know where they are. I simply can&rsquo;t get in touch with them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s true, then this is quite a bit more troubling.&rdquo; Qiushui Fuyan shook her head.<br>&ldquo;Senior Qiushui, do you know where Murong Xun and the others are preparing to go? And where on their path is the most suitable place for an ambush?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;The reason I hesitated in telling you is because I was afraid you would be rash. This is a trap! Are you going to jump into that trap in order to save them? You know that you&rsquo;re the one the Immortal Execution Archipelago wants to kill the most!&rdquo; Qiushui Fuyan instantly knew his plans when she heard Chu Feng&rsquo;s question.<br>&ldquo;But Senior Qiushui, as a man, I should put the word &lsquo;loyalty&rsquo; at the forefront of my mind. If I had never learnt of this, then there would really be nothing I could do. However, since I have learnt of this, I cannot ignore it. I&rsquo;m sure if the Crippling Night Demon Sect knew I was in danger, they would definitely come and save me.<br>&ldquo;Right now, I already have a certain amount of strength to protect myself. Even Martial Kings may not be able to do much to me. At least, they shouldn&rsquo;t even think of killing me.<br>&ldquo;Besides, I&rsquo;m not throwing myself into a trap. I just want to stop the Crippling Night Demon Sect before they make a move,&rdquo; Chu Feng explained.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, don&rsquo;t be so stubborn! First of all, you aren&rsquo;t even that close to the people from the Crippling Night Demon Sect. It&rsquo;s not worth it to risk your life for them.<br>&ldquo;In addition, even if you don&rsquo;t think for yourself, you should at least think for Zi Ling, Su Rou, and Su Mei, right?<br>&ldquo;Do you know how worried they get every time you head out? Of course, everything would be fine if you return peacefully. However, if something truly happens to you, do you think they will continue living?&rdquo; Qiushui Fuyan said strictly.<br>At that instant, Chu Feng&rsquo;s face expressed his conflicting state of mind. Of course, it wasn&rsquo;t that he didn&rsquo;t know such logic, but he still said, &ldquo;Senior Qiushui, I know you are thinking for my sake.<br>&ldquo;However, you also don&rsquo;t want me to be an unloyal and unrighteous person, right? I&rsquo;m sure even if Zi Ling, Su Rou, and Su Mei know about this, they&rsquo;ll definitely support me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ahh, whatever, whatever. I can&rsquo;t be more stubborn than you. But this journey is a very dangerous one. In order to guarantee no accidents, I&rsquo;ll just come with you,&rdquo; said Qiushui Fuyan, in the end, with quite a bit of helplessness.<br>Chu Feng was elated when he heard she was going to go with him. He quickly said, &ldquo;Thank you, Senior Qiushui Fuyan. You truly treat me quite well.&rdquo;<br>Qiushui Fuyan was a Martial King, and the Holy Daughter of the Burning Heaven Church. Although she was only a rank one Martial King, her strength was definitely not weak. With her, Chu Feng&rsquo;s confidence was boosted greatly.<br>After deciding, Chu Feng and Qiushui Fuyan didn&rsquo;t dally much. After saying their farewells with Zi Ling and the others, they left immediately. After all, that was a huge matter&mdash;saving lives.<br>During the journey with Qiushui Fuyan, Chu Feng heard that Murong Xun and the others left the Immortal Execution Archipelago&rsquo;s headquarters to head towards another region to pick up something important. It was an iron called Ancient Adamantium.<br>It was rumoured to be a type of iron that came from the Ancient Era. Although it was not a cultivation resource, it was extremely valuable&mdash;it was a main component in creating Royal Armaments.<br>Although there weren&rsquo;t any Royal-cloak World Spiritists in the Eastern Sea Region, thus no one could create a Royal Armament, they were still able to create imitations of Royal Armaments&mdash;the Incomplete Royal Armaments<br>There were many Ancient Adamantium Ingots, and if they were made into Incomplete Royal Armament on a large scale, that would greatly raise the total strength of the Immortal Execution Archipelago.<br>Moreover, he learnt from Qiushui Fuyan that the rumours spread by the Immortal Execution Archipelago were still true, despite being a trap. The Immortal Execution Archipelago had indeed dug up large amounts of Ancient Adamantium Ores, and Murong Xun was indeed heading over to pick them up back to the Immortal Execution Archipelago&rsquo;s headquarters in order to create Incomplete Royal Armaments.<br>However, they also took this chance to release rumours. They wanted to set up a trap for the Crippling Night Demon Sect.<br>As such, no matter what he had to do, Chu Feng decided he was not going to let the Immortal Execution Archipelago&rsquo;s scheme succeed.<br></p></div>
