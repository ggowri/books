        <h1>Chapter 5429: Insane</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>It was Bai Yunqing. He happened to stumble upon the sight of Ling Hang attempting to do something inappropriate to Li Ta&rsquo;er. He didn&rsquo;t know what had happened, but he couldn&rsquo;t allow Ling Hang to harm Li Ta&rsquo;er.</span><br><span>&ldquo;How unexpected. Trash like you was actually able to get in here.&rdquo; Ling Hang was surprised.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Screw you!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Bai Yunqing didn&rsquo;t want to waste his breath talking to Ling Hang. He hurled his fist out to strike Ling Hang in the face.</span><br><span>Ling Hang willingly took the punch</span><span> face-on. He was pushed back, but he didn&rsquo;t suffer any injuries as a result.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Your spirit power is decent, but it&rsquo;s a pity that you&rsquo;re no match for me here,&rdquo; Ling Hang sneered in disdain.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You deserve to die for daring to touch my big sister Ta&rsquo;er!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Bai Yunqing formed a series of hand seals and manifested a massive formation sword. He was a Purple Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, but his strength was further enhanced by the power bestowed upon him by this land. He swung his sword toward Ling Hang.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know your place!&rdquo; Ling Hang sneered.</span><br><span>With a casual wave of his hand, Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s formation sword shattered into pieces. Ling Hang&rsquo;s fighting prowess was far above Bai Yunqing, not because of the gap in their spirit power but because he had received much more power from this hall.</span><br><span>&ldquo;A trash dares to ruin my plan?&rdquo; Ling Hang snorted.</span><br><span>He raised his palm and thrust it toward Bai Yunqing. It might appear to be a simple palm strike, but the force behind it was far stronger than Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s earlier sword. If the attack were to land, Bai Yunqing would definitely sustain severe injuries.</span><br><span>Refusing to admit defeat, Bai Yunqing quickly constructed a shield formation to counterattack. However, his shield formation could not hold its own against the palm strike and was crushed to bits. There was already no time for Bai Yunqing to deploy another defensive maneuver, and he had no choice but to accept his fate.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>With a resounding explosion, Ling Hang&rsquo;s palm strike suddenly stalled to a halt. A person had appeared in front of Bai Yunqing&mdash;Chu Feng.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Bai Yunqing was overjoyed to see Chu Feng, but Li Ta&rsquo;er had a conflicted look on her face.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hoh! You also managed to get in here? I have really underestimated the two of you.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Ling Hang wasn&rsquo;t nervous at all to see Chu Feng. Instead, he thought that this was a good opportunity for him to teach the two of them a lesson for their earlier arrogance.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Today, I&rsquo;ll let the two of you know that I, Ling Hang&hellip; Uwah!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Before Ling Hang could even finish his sentence, he was suddenly flattened to the ground. Chu Feng had released his spirit power to crush Ling Hang into the ground, rendering him immobile.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, you&hellip;&rdquo;</span><br><span>It was only then that Bai Yunqing realized that there was a divine aura shrouding Chu Feng, which made it seem as if he was the master of this treasure. It was clear as day to </span><span>them that Chu Feng had been bestowed with far greater power than Ling Hang.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s with your confused expression? You don&rsquo;t understand what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Chu Feng eyed Ling Hang with narrowed eyes.</span><br><span>&ldquo;How could you acquire even greater power than me here?&rdquo; Ling Hang raised his doubt.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because of this.&rdquo; Chu Feng opened up his palm, revealing the copper key in his grasp. The copper key was releasing a brilliant glow, revealing that it was the source of his power.</span><br><span>&ldquo;How could you still be in possession of the copper key if you&rsquo;re still in here?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Bai Yunqing beat Chu Feng to answer that question. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because my big brother Chu Feng is far more talented than you. He is able to enter this place even without relying on that key.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible. Absolutely impossible.&rdquo; Ling Hang refused to accept that answer.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Impossible your head!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Bai Yunqing marched up to Ling Hang with the intention to beat him up, but Li Ta&rsquo;er stopped him, saying, &ldquo;Forget it, Bai Yunqing. He&rsquo;s from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Now that Li Ta&rsquo;er had calmed down from the earlier shock, she realized that they couldn&rsquo;t afford to offend Ling Hang. However, Bai Yunqing simply sneered, &ldquo;So what if he&rsquo;s from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion? I won&rsquo;t forgive anyone who dares to hurt my big sister Ta&rsquo;er!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Bai Yunqing insistently hurled a fist toward Ling Hang, only to be stopped by a hand.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing looked at Chu Feng in confusion, not understanding why the latter had stopped him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Your big sister Ta&rsquo;er is right. You shouldn&rsquo;t touch Ling Hang. He is from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, after all,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; Ling Hang sneered. &ldquo;It looks like your big brother knows his place. Touching someone from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion will only bring disaster upon&hellip;&rdquo;</span><br><span>Before he could finish his sentence, a fist had sunk into his face, causing three of his teeth to fly in all directions. It was Chu Feng.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Y-you dare to hit me?&rdquo; Ling Hang stared at Chu Feng in disbelief.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Of course. What makes you think that I wouldn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I am from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion!&rdquo; Ling Hang roared.</span><br><span>&ldquo;My greatest hobby is none other than beating up people like you from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion!&rdquo; Chu Feng scoffed as he continued throwing punches and kicks at Ling Hang.</span><br><span>His movements were primitive and without any flair, but such attacks were the most humiliating of all. Ling Hang was left groaning in pain.</span><br><span>Li Ta&rsquo;er was taken aback to witness Chu Feng&rsquo;s violence. She didn&rsquo;t think that he would be so bold as to even disregard someone from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. She had thought that Chu Feng&rsquo;s rumors were exaggerated, but it looked like they had been toned down instead.</span><br><span>Chu Feng stopped shortly after, but by then, Ling Hang was bruised and swollen all over so that it was almost impossible to make out who he was.</span><br><span>&ldquo;S-stop hitting me! Stop hitting me!&rdquo; Ling Hang pleaded for mercy. His previously suave face was now as swollen as a pig&rsquo;s head.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Apologize to my brother,&rdquo; Chu Feng ordered.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m sorry, Brother Bai. I was wrong.&rdquo; Ling Hang obediently admitted his mistake.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Remember, I am the one who beat you up today. If you want to exact vengeance on anyone, come for me instead,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I understand&hellip; No no no, what I mean is that I won&rsquo;t exact vengeance on you. I was wrong. I&rsquo;ll earnestly repent for my actions!&rdquo; Ling Hang exclaimed.</span><br><span>Li Ta&rsquo;er was left feeling conflicted by Ling Hang&rsquo;s cowardice, but Chu Feng was already used to it. He had seen far too much of such stuff.</span><br><span>Weng!</span><br><span>A surge of teleportation energy enveloped the entire hall.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Time&rsquo;s up,&rdquo; Chu Feng murmured.</span><br><span>The group was teleported out of the copper palace.</span><br><span>Ling Hang quickly constructed a recovery formation to treat himself, fearing that others would see him in his current embarrassing state.</span><br><span>Li Ta&rsquo;er looked a little nervous. She was still worried about how Ling Hang would react to this incident. Thus, she looked at Chu Feng, only to see that his attitude hadn&rsquo;t changed in the least despite having lost the power he had gained from the copper palace.</span><br><span>&ldquo;This fellow.&rdquo; Li Ta&rsquo;er couldn&rsquo;t tell whether he was brave or a fool.</span><br><span>&ldquo;My treasure! My family heirloom!&rdquo; Ling Hang suddenly howled.</span><br><span>Cracks had appeared on the copper palace, a sign that it couldn&rsquo;t be used anymore.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you! You must be the one behind this! I don&rsquo;t know what kind of sorcery you employed, but you must be the culprit who ruined my family heirloom! Chu Feng, I won&rsquo;t spare you. You must pay the price of your actions!&rdquo; Ling Hang pointed his finger at Chu Feng and roared.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you been beaten up enough?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo; Ling Hang shuddered in fear upon hearing those words. The earlier beating he went through had traumatized him. However, he quickly regained his courage and bellowed, &ldquo;You think that I&rsquo;ll be afraid of you? Chu Feng, you must not know who I am! My father and Ling Sheng&rsquo;er&rsquo;s father are sworn brothers. By offending me, you have also offended Ling Sheng&rsquo;er. There&rsquo;s no way she&rsquo;ll let you off!&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Ling Sheng&rsquo;er?&rdquo; Both Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing were surprised to hear that name.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know Ling Sheng&rsquo;er? Well, that&rsquo;s only to be expected. You aren&rsquo;t from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, after all. You should have at least heard of Ling Mo&rsquo;er, right? Ling Sheng&rsquo;er is Ling Mo&rsquo;er&rsquo;s little sister, but her talent far surpasses the latter.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Let me put it in such a way. You know about Jie Ranqing, right? Ling Sheng&rsquo;er&rsquo;s talent is second only to Jie Ranqing in the entire history of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. Almost everyone in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion believes that it&rsquo;s inevitable that Ling Sheng&rsquo;er will surpass Ling Xiao&hellip; and her father is my father&rsquo;s sworn brother!</span><br><span>&ldquo;You must have thought that I&rsquo;m just an ordinary member of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, but you barked up the wrong tree. Do you know just how big of trouble you&rsquo;re in?&rdquo; Ling Hang sneered.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Ling Hang, do me a favor,&rdquo; Chu Feng suddenly said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; Ling Hang was surprised by the sudden change of tone.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Send Ling Sheng&rsquo;er my regards when you return,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Send her your regards? Are you sick in the head? Who do you think you are to send my little sister Sheng&rsquo;er your regards? You must be out of your mind!&rdquo; Ling Hang was </span><span>bewildered.</span><br></p></div>
