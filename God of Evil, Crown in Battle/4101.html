        <h1>Chapter 4100</h1>
        <div> - I Am Long Daozhi<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Who are you? Do you dare voice your name?&rdquo; the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master asked with a stern voice.<br>&ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t I dare?&rdquo;<br>That voice sounded again. Merely, this time around, that voice did not sound from an indistinct location.<br>Instead, it came from before Chu Feng.<br>Looking over, a figure was standing before Chu Feng.<br>Seeing this person, Chu Feng and the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were overjoyed.<br>The reason for that was because this person was the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s strongest individual, the Ancestral Martial Dragon City&rsquo;s City Master.<br>As for the people from the Purple Star Hall, they were somewhat confused. They did not recognize the Ancestral Martial Dragon City&rsquo;s City Master.<br>While he didn&rsquo;t know who his opponent was, the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master did not dare to be careless. Thus, with a stern voice, he asked, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I am Ancestral Martial Dragon City&rsquo;s Long Daozhi,&rdquo; Long Daozhi declared his name.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>However, surprisingly, after learning Long Daozhi&rsquo;s identity, the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master actually revealed a smile.<br>He seemed to have eased up from the nervousness he had felt before, and was no longer acting that cautious.<br>&ldquo;And here I was wondering who it was. So it was you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve actually heard of you already. I know you&rsquo;re quite capable.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, wasn&rsquo;t your Ancestral Martial Dragon City never one to involve yourselves in anything? Why would you decide to meddle in other people&rsquo;s business today?&rdquo; asked the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>&ldquo;Other people&rsquo;s business?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re calling your bullying of the people from my Ancestral Martial Starfield other people&rsquo;s business?&rdquo; Long Daozhi refuted.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I&rsquo;d still urge you to consider carefully before acting.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you are to truly fight me, things will not be that simple anymore.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Those who dared to attack me are all people that have committed a capital offense,&rdquo; said the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; Long Daozhi smiled faintly.<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>Following that, the surrounding atmosphere changed. He had unleashed his oppressive might.<br>His oppressive might wreaked havoc as it enveloped heaven, earth and everyone present.<br>Everyone could sense the cultivation of this expert from the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>He&hellip; was a rank six Utmost Exalted.<br>Rank six Utmost Exalted. This cultivation was comparable to the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>No one would&rsquo;ve imagined that the Ancestral Martial Starfield deemed to be the weakest in all of the Holy Light Galaxy&rsquo;s starfields would possess an expert of this caliber.<br>At the time when the majority of the crowd were shocked by Long Daozhi&rsquo;s cultivation, the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master shook his head.<br>There was no trace of caution on his face at all.<br>Compared to earlier, he was now completely relaxed.<br>The reason why he was afraid earlier was because he didn&rsquo;t know who his foe was.<br>Upon learning of Long Daozhi&rsquo;s identity, he had loosened up greatly.<br>After all, the status of the Ancestral Martial Starfield was already set in stone in his mind.<br>No matter how powerful Long Daozhi might be, since he was from the Ancestral Martial Starfield, the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master would inevitably belittle him.<br>That said, he did not immediately attack Long Daozhi after learning his identity. Instead, he had spoken to threaten him.<br>The reason for that was because he had actually had some restraining fear.<br>The fear he had, originated from his uncertainty of Long Daozhi&rsquo;s cultivation.<br>But now that he had discovered Long Daozhi&rsquo;s cultivation to be equal to his, all of his restraining fear disappeared.<br>He felt that, with an equal cultivation, he would possess at least a ninety percent chance of victory.<br>After all, he was the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master. He believed that the mysterious techniques and martial skills he had learned were most definitely not something that someone from an Abandoned Starfield could match.<br>&ldquo;Truly never would I have expected that everyone from your Ancestral Martial Starfield would possess the same sort of ignorance of not knowing the immensity of heaven and earth.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since you have refused the face that was given to you, do not blame me for being impolite.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master intended to attack.<br>However, to his surprise, Long Daozhi waved his sleeve and tossed an item into the sky.<br>That was a spheroid. It was completely golden in color, and seemed to be made from metal.<br>Once it was tossed into the sky, it immediately began expanding in size. Soon, it turned into a colossus tens of thousands of meters long.<br>That item was a seal. It seemed like a fort. At its center was a spirit formation gate, which was the entrance to that item.<br>Chu Feng noticed that the golden colossus&rsquo;s surface was covered in runes and symbols. Seeing that, he knew that it was a treasure created through world spirit techniques.<br>Seeing that treasure, the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s gaze changed somewhat.<br>He was able to tell what the usage of that treasure was.<br>It was most likely a treasure specialized for duels.<br>It might be able to withstand the battle power of rank six Utmost Exalted. It went without saying how valuable of a treasure it was.<br>Even his Purple Star Hall did not possess a treasure like that.<br>&ldquo;Our battle shouldn&rsquo;t involve other people. If you want to fight, then follow me.&rdquo;<br>As the Ancestral Martial Dragon City&rsquo;s City Master spoke, he turned around and leapt into that treasure.<br>Seeing that, the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master let out a cold snort and followed Long Daozhi into the treasure.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right after the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master entered, the runes and symbols on the surface of the treasure began to radiate dazzling light.<br>Even the treasure itself began to tremble violently.<br>The trembling was so powerful that the surrounding space was being affected by it.<br>Furthermore, energy ripples were being emitted from the treasure.<br>Even though the energy ripples were very weak, it still made the crowd realize what was going on.<br>That treasure seemed to be having difficulty containing the battle.<br>Because of this, many people revealed uneasy looks on their faces. Some of the more cowardly individuals immediately escaped from this place.<br>They all felt that it was very possible for the treasure to be unable to withstand a battle between two rank six Utmost Exalted.<br>If that treasure were to burst apart, the oppressive might and martial power wreaking havoc inside it would impact everyone present, bringing forth a calamity upon all of them.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>However, at the time when the crowd were feeling worried, the light from the treasure began to dissipate.<br>Then, a figure shot out from the spirit formation entrance.<br>With the speed that figure was flying at, he would definitely be seriously injured upon impact with the ground.<br>That said, that figure managed to stabilize his body right before he reached the ground.<br>That said, when the crowd managed to clearly see who this person was, they were all unable to keep their calm.<br>This person was the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>Merely, the current Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master looked terrible.<br>Not only was there blood at the corner of his mouth, but his body was also covered in stab wounds.<br>Furthermore, his right arm had disappeared.<br>A large amount of blood was flowing from his severed arm.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, something else flew out from the treasure.<br>It was an arm. Furthermore, that arm was holding an Incomplete Exalted Armament.<br>That was the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s severed arm.<br>&ldquo;Seems like the Purple Star Hall is nothing much either.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Lower Starfields are nothing much either.&rdquo;<br>At the time when the crowd were still shocked, a voice sounded from the sky.<br>It was Long Daozhi.<br>Long Daozhi slowly descended from the sky, and landed before Chu Feng.<br>Seeing Long Daozhi, the others and even Chu Feng felt surprised.<br>Long Daozhi had not even fought the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master long enough to finish half a cup of tea.<br>Yet, the battle was determined in such a short period of time.<br>This meant that even though they were both rank six Utmost Exalted, there was an enormous disparity in their strengths.<br>Long Daozhi&rsquo;s strength far surpassed that of the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>Not only was the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall master battered and exhausted, but he also had a look of unwillingness on his face. Yet, he did not dare to voice any complaints.<br>From his flickering eyes, one could see that he had begun to fear Long Daozhi.<br>The Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master flicked his wrist and grabbed. With that, the severed limb flew toward him.<br>He was not only planning to retrieve his weapon, but he also wanted to retrieve his lost limb.<br>&ldquo;Paa~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right after the severed arm started flying toward him, a foot stomped it to the ground.<br>It was Long Daozhi.<br>Long Daozhi&rsquo;s stomp crushed the severed arm into two pieces.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Anger filled the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s face when he saw that.<br>Humiliation. That was an enormous humiliation toward him.<br>&ldquo;What do you want to say?&rdquo; Long Daozhi asked with a sneer. Contempt filled his eyes as he looked to the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>It was a gaze of someone completely disregarding another person.<br>&ldquo;Long Daozhi, don&rsquo;t you act too excessive here!&rdquo; the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master shouted angrily.<br>&ldquo;Excessive?&rdquo;<br>Long Daozhi narrowed his brows and released his overwhelming killing intent.<br>&ldquo;Eeeahhh~~~&rdquo;<br>The experts from the Purple Star Hall all grabbed their heads and began to roll on the ground while screaming in pain.<br>Everyone beside the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master was acting this way. Even Li Mengyue was affected.<br>This was caused by oppressive might. Long Daozhi&rsquo;s oppressive might was attacking everyone from the Purple Star Hall.<br>Then, Long Daozhi turned his gaze back to the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>Merely, his eyes were no longer filled with contempt. Instead, they were now filled with anger.<br>&ldquo;The person who went back on their word is you. The person who tried to bully others with your strength is you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet now, you&rsquo;re saying that I&rsquo;m being excessive?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let me tell you this: not only am I not being excessive by teaching you a lesson, but even if I were to wipe out your entire Purple Star Hall, no one would dare say that I acted excessively!&rdquo; Long Daozhi shouted.<br></p></div>
