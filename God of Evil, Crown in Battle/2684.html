        <div> - Being Tailed<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Haha, I believe you,&rdquo; Chu Feng laughed. Then, he added, &ldquo;Song Xi, I have already told you many times now. If you consider me your friend, then just address me as Chu Feng. There is no need to address me as lord. That would be regarding me as an outsider. I am very unused to that.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, wouldn&rsquo;t it be disrespectful for me to address an expert like you by name?&rdquo;<br>Song Xi was hesitant. However, it could be seen from the expression in his eyes that he seemed to be looking forward to it.<br>He was looking forward to actually being able to address Chu Feng by name.<br>He felt that if he could address Chu Feng by name, it would be a very honorable thing to do, given how weak his cultivation was.<br>&ldquo;The fellowship between brothers is not something measured with the strength of one&rsquo;s cultivation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Instead, it is measured by how close we are to one another.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With how courteous you&rsquo;re acting, you are simply not considering me, Chu Feng, as your friend,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;No, no. That is not my intention at all,&rdquo; Song Xi hurriedly waved his hand.<br>&ldquo;Then address me as Chu Feng,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Very well. Since that&rsquo;s the case, I shall be rude. Chu Feng. Haha,&rdquo; Song Xi laughed foolishly. It was a very brilliant laughter.<br>It could be seen that Song Xi was very happy. Although he was older than Chu Feng, he was much more naive than Chu Feng. His character was simply like that of a child.<br>&ldquo;Song Xi, take this. Do not return to work for that Zhao Mansion again,&rdquo; Chu Feng handed Song Xi a Cosmos Sack.<br>Through his conversation with Song Xi over the past few days, Chu Feng had discovered that Song Xi was merely a day laborer at the Zhao Mansion. His status in the Zhao Mansion was very low, and was generally beaten, scolded, bullied and humiliated by others.<br>If it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that his mother was seriously ill and needed precious medicines to treat her illness, Song Xi would not have continued to stay in the Zhao Mansion.<br>As for the things within the Cosmos Sack, they were enough to allow Song Xi to not have to worry about basic necessities for the rest of his life. At the very least, he would not have to worry about money issues for a while.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip; this is too precious. I&hellip; I&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Song Xi received the Cosmos Sack from Chu Feng. Upon inspecting the contents of the Cosmos Sack, his expression changed immediately.<br>He was extremely excited. In fact, he even felt disbelief. He had never expected that Chu Feng would be willing to give him such a precious Cosmos Sack after knowing one another for only a short period of time.<br>Due to the fact that the contents of the Cosmos Sack were simply too precious, Song Xi found it difficult to accept it. He felt that he couldn&rsquo;t accept such a precious gift.<br>But, he also needed money very badly. The treasures contained in the Cosmos Sack Chu Feng handed him were simply akin to sending him charcoal in snowy weather.<br>If he were to tell Chu Feng he didn&rsquo;t want the Cosmos Sack, it would most definitely be a lie.<br>&ldquo;I have already told you from the very beginning that I would reward you for your help. That is the reward,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;But, this reward is simply too much, no? I have merely given you some directions. My help was simply not worth this reward,&rdquo; Song Xi said.<br>&ldquo;Just accept it. Perhaps it might not be worth it to give others this much for their help, but I feel like it is worthy to give you that much for your help,&rdquo; Chu Feng patted Song Xi&rsquo;s shoulder.<br>Song Xi was suddenly stunned upon hearing what Chu Feng said. He only managed to react again after a short period of time passed. However, at that moment, his eyes had already moistened.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I have never met someone as good as you. I&hellip; I&hellip; I truly do not know what to say to you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Song Xi, don&rsquo;t say anymore. If you are to continue to speak like this, I will instead feel that you&rsquo;re trying to flatter me,&rdquo; Chu Feng patted Song Xi&rsquo;s shoulder and spoke with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Haha&hellip; no, I&rsquo;m not trying to flatter you,&rdquo; Song Xi smiled upon hearing what Chu Feng said. Then, he wiped away the tears that were about to flow from his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what do you plan to do now?&rdquo; Song Xi asked Chu Feng.<br>He felt that since a grand character like Chu Feng had arrived in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, he would most definitely try to unleash his might.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to your home,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What? You want to go to my home?&rdquo; Song Xi was startled. Evidently, he was caught off-guard by Chu Feng&rsquo;s answer.<br>&ldquo;Song Xi, since I&rsquo;ve said that you are my friend, it means that I am truly considering you to be my friend.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, your mother is equivalent to being my mother too. Since she has fallen ill, I cannot disregard this matter.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It just so happens that I am a world spiritist. I think I should be able to help you with your mother&rsquo;s illness,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Song Xi.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re planning to go to my home because you want to help me cure my mother&rsquo;s illness?&rdquo; Song Xi&rsquo;s eyes were wide open. Incomparable shock filled his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I&hellip;&rdquo; At that moment, tears rolled down Song Xi&rsquo;s cheeks.<br>When Chu Feng had given him all that wealth earlier, his eyes had merely turned red.<br>However, upon finding out that Chu Feng was planning to go to his home so that he could personally help him cure his mother&rsquo;s illness, Song Xi was no longer able to contain his emotions.<br>It was partially due to being moved by Chu Feng that Song Xi reacted like that. However, more than anything else, it was because Chu Feng said that he might be able to bring relief or even cure his mother&rsquo;s illness.<br>The reason why Song Xi had such an enormous reaction upon hearing what Chu Feng said was because he was a filial son.<br>As for Chu Feng, the reason why he decided to address Song Xi as his brother even though they were only strangers that met one another not long ago was because Chu Feng thought highly of Song Xi&rsquo;s character.<br>Actually, Chu Feng did not have a lot of friends. However, all the people that Chu Feng were willing to befriend were those that were affectionate and true.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough. Real men shouldn&rsquo;t cry so easily. What&rsquo;s there to cry about?&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>After that, Chu Feng and Song Xi began to travel toward the direction of Song Xi&rsquo;s home; they began to travel back in the direction that they came from.<br>Helping Song Xi cure his mother&rsquo;s illness was only one of the goals of Chu Feng&rsquo;s journey to Song Xi&rsquo;s home. In addition to that, Chu Feng wanted to have another look at the Sacred Mountain.<br>Chu Feng felt that it was highly possible for what he had encountered in the Stairway to Heaven to be man-made.<br>If Chu Feng wanted to investigate, the Sacred Mountain would be the only way for him to begin his investigation.<br>In fact, Chu Feng felt that Wang Qiang and the others might even be present in the Sacred Mountain too.<br>However, Chu Feng had no idea that he was currently&hellip; being followed by two people.<br>Most importantly, those two people were much stronger than Chu Feng. Thus, Chu Feng was unable to detect them following him at all.<br>On their way back, Chu Feng and Song Xi didn't say anything&hellip;<br>After traveling for some time, Chu Feng and Song Xi finally arrived at Song Xi&rsquo;s home.<br>Song Xi&rsquo;s home was located on a large mountain. This mountain was very close to the Sacred Mountain.<br>However, while the Sacred Mountain had no trace of human activity, there were quite a lot of inhabitants on the mountain.<br>Those people could all be considered weak individuals within their region. All those with ability, influence and power had left for the city.<br>Only those people remained living in that place.<br>Although those people would all be considered poor in their region, they were not living in mud houses or straw huts.<br>Although their homes were not vast and large, they were all quite exquisite and refined.<br>This was understandable too. After all, no matter how weak Song Xi might be, he was still a Martial Ancestor-level expert.<br>Furthermore, Song Xi was also a world spiritist. With his skill as a world spiritist, he would not only be able to create exquisite homes, but he would even be able to create massive palaces with no issue.<br>However, from the simple residence that was Song Xi&rsquo;s home, it could also be seen that Song Xi was inherently a simple man.<br>Actually, Song Xi was quite a hard-working individual. He had left his home to wander the world before, and earned quite a decent amount of wealth.<br>If it wasn&rsquo;t for his mother&rsquo;s illness, Song Xi would not have returned home and become so disappointingly poor. He would not have fallen so low as to become a day laborer for the Zhao Mansion.<br>In Song Xi&rsquo;s home was an old lady asleep on a bed. She had a head of white hair and a face filled with wrinkles.<br>That old lady was Song Xi&rsquo;s mother.<br>Chu Feng and Song Xi were standing before the bed. Chu Feng placed his hand onto Song Xi&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s wrist. He was currently diagnosing her illness.<br>The more Chu Feng diagnosed, the more his brows furrowed.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, is my mother&rsquo;s illness capable of being cured?&rdquo;<br>Song Xi asked Chu Feng. He was very nervous when he asked that question.<br>He was afraid that Chu Feng would not be able to handle his mother&rsquo;s illness. If that was the case, he would have no idea who could possibly cure his mother.<br>After all, with the status that he held, it would be extremely difficult for him to ask someone stronger than Chu Feng to help him cure his mother.<br>&ldquo;Your mother&rsquo;s condition is indeed a bit complicated. Actually, she is not ill. Rather, she has been poisoned.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, as the poison has been left untreated for a long time, it has already invaded her soul,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Song Xi.<br>&ldquo;What? It has already invaded her soul? This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Song Xi&rsquo;s complexion immediately turned paper pale upon hearing what Chu Feng said. In fact, he was unable to even stand straight. He began to move backwards continuously. Had Chu Feng not extended his arm to support him, he would&rsquo;ve fallen to the ground.<br>Song Xi was so shocked and frightened upon hearing his mother&rsquo;s condition that his legs had grown weak.<br>This was understandable. After all, to have poison invade one&rsquo;s soul was extremely dangerous.<br>Song Xi was also a world spiritist. He knew very well how dangerous that sort of condition was.<br>He felt that his mother would likely not be able to live. No matter how good the medicine he could obtain might be, it would not be able to save her.<br>As a filial son, this was something that he was unable to accept.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t panic. Although this poison is a bit thorny to deal with, if you are to give me a day, I will be able to remove it,&rdquo; Chu Feng added.<br>&ldquo;Truly?! Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re saying that you&rsquo;re able to cure the poison in my mother?&rdquo; Disbelief filled Song Xi&rsquo;s paper pale face upon hearing what Chu Feng said.<br>Although he knew that Chu Feng was very powerful, he still felt disbelief upon hearing what Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Trust me.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he opened his palm, and a strand of spirit power that was like a little snake began to spiral on top of his palm.<br>&ldquo;This is, Immortal-level spirit power. Furthermore, it&rsquo;s a Snake Mark.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Heavens! You&rsquo;re a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist?!&rdquo; Song Xi once again revealed astonishment upon seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power.<br>Chu Feng did not answer Song Xi&rsquo;s question directly. Instead, he smiled and nodded.<br>&ldquo;This is truly great, truly great! I have truly encountered a grand individual! My mother can be saved now!&rdquo; At that moment, an ecstatic expression filled Song Xi&rsquo;s face. He was so excited and emotional that his eyes were brimming with tears.<br>Precisely because he was also a world spiritist, he knew very well how powerful Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists were.<br>After finding out that Chu Feng was a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, he became firmly certain that his mother&rsquo;s illness could be treated.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, I will definitely be able to treat your mother. Merely&hellip; you need to think properly about this. Roughly three years ago, who could have poisoned your mother?&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Who? Chu Feng, why would you ask that?&rdquo; Song Xi was puzzled. He was shocked by Chu Feng&rsquo;s question.<br>&ldquo;I am certain that the poison affecting your mother was forced into her body. It was caused by someone,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br><br><br></p></div>
