        <h1>Chapter 5527: Intimidation</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>Long Chengyu and the others left according to Chu Feng&rsquo;s instructions, leaving the latter alone in the vicinity. Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t complete the formation immediately but instead spent some time constructing multiple formations in the vicinity.</span><br><span>He even collected the ashes of the Blood-eyed Qilin Clansmen, knowing that their lingering auras would prove useful.</span><br><span>It was only after he was done constructing the formations that he finally stepped into the formation core. Same as before, he quickly completed the formation with his red lightning aura. Following that, he hid in a discreet location that he believed was safe.</span><br><span>Just as he had expected, moments after the formation was completed, a couple of Blood-eyed Qilin Clansmen rushed over. Leading the group was none other than Qi Weidao.</span><br><span>As soon as they stepped into the vicinity, Chu Feng activated his formation, causing innumerable carcasses to appear on the ground, including the rank five Half-God level Blood-eyed Qilin Clansman.</span><br><span>These were fake carcasses created by Chu Feng, but the usage of the real ashes made them look lifelike. The sight of the carcasses came as a huge blow to the Blood-eyed Qilin Clansmen.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Long Chengyu, I&rsquo;ll destroy your Totem Dragon Clan!&rdquo; Qi Weidao roared as murderous intent rippled from him. He was a rank five Half-God level cultivator, just like Long Chengyu!</span><br><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s indeed something off about that fellow! Let me see how strong you are,&rdquo; Chu Feng murmured as he activated yet another formation.</span><br><span>A figure suddenly appeared amidst the carcass. It was Long Chengyu, emanating the aura of a rank eight Half-God level cultivator and wielding a God Armament.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You want to destroy my clan? Hah! You can die with your brethren!&rdquo; Long Chengyu emanated a terrifying aura.</span><br><span>A hint of unease crept into the eyes of the infuriated Qi Weidao. His body began to transform as his cultivation surged all the way to rank eight Half-God level. At the same time, he whipped out a God Armament blade covered in blue scales.</span><br><span>Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t help but notice that Qi Weidao&rsquo;s transformation was different than the other rank five Half-God level Blood-eyed Qilin Clansman. In contrast to the latter&rsquo;s transformation, which made him more monster-like, Qi Weidao&rsquo;s transformation made him more human-like. He even lost a huge bunch of his scales, making him look like a suave young man.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>Unaware that Chu Feng was spying on him, Qi Weidao unhesitatingly drove his sword toward Long Chengyu.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>A huge wave of martial power rippled outward, preventing Chu Feng from clearly discerning what was happening. It utterly destroyed the formation Chu Feng had constructed, revealing the true scenery beneath it.</span><br><span>&ldquo;An illusory formation?&rdquo;</span><br><span>It was only then that Qi Weidao realized that he had been tricked. Both the carcasses and Long Chengyu were fakes created by the illusory formation.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie? Who would construct this formation to deceive us?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The other Blood-eyed Qilin Clansmen were infuriated. Since this was all an illusory formation, they figured that their clansmen were likely to be still alive.</span><br><span>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not right.&rdquo; Qi Weidao looked at the scarred earth, which was a clear sign that an intense battle had broken out here. He grabbed the soil and lifted a handful of ashes. These were indubitably the ashes of his Blood-eyed Qilin Clansmen. &ldquo;Our people have died here.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are they dead? Who&rsquo;s the culprit? Is it the Totem Dragon Clan?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The Blood-eyed Qilin Clansmen clenched their fists as their killing intent flowed out. It was then that a voice echoed from afar.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Your people were the ones who attacked the Totem Dragon Clansmen. They had it coming. Those from the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan, I advise you to stay low, or else be prepared to face the same fate,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he revealed himself.</span><br><span>He had already activated his Lightning Mark, Lightning Armor, and Lightning Wings, but he concealed them using his spirit power. The Blood-eyed Qilin Clansmen couldn&rsquo;t see his means or sense his aura at all.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng? You were the one who constructed that formation? Were you testing out </span><span>my strength?&rdquo; Qi Weidao quickly figured out the intention behind that formation.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, I wanted to test your strength, but I must say that it&rsquo;s a disappointment. If that&rsquo;s all you have, you&rsquo;re just going to die in vain,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are you trying to intimidate me?&rdquo; Qi Weidao didn&rsquo;t believe Chu Feng&rsquo;s words.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You think that I&rsquo;m just intimidating you?&rdquo; Chu Feng chuckled.</span><br><span>He opened his palm, and a powerful surge of red lightning aura rose from his hand.</span><br><span>&ldquo;He was the one behind the red lightning formations?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The Blood-eyed Qilin Clansmen were stunned. They had long noticed the red lightning formations, and they could sense how terrifying they were too.</span><br><span>In truth, Chu Feng had released the red lightning aura not just to scare them but also to attempt to steal the avatars above Qi Weidao&rsquo;s head. If he could do so, they would surely be even more intimidated by him.</span><br><span>However, Qi Weidao was no pushover. He wouldn&rsquo;t stand still as Chu Feng exerted his red lightning aura from afar. That would only expose that Chu Feng was actually the weaker one here. Thus, Chu Feng decided to directly showcase his red lightning aura instead.</span><br><span>From the looks of it, Chu Feng&rsquo;s intimidation worked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t have to resort to such tricks if you were the one who killed them,&rdquo; Qi Weidao voiced his suspicions.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Qi Weidao, I have always been one to return respect with respect. Both I and the Totem Dragon Clan can let things slip here as long as you step down on this matter, but if you wish to continue pursuing this issue, I&rsquo;ll make sure that none of you leave this place alive,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a confident sneer.</span><br><span>However, Qi Weidao didn&rsquo;t fall for his lies. He gathered his martial power in preparation to attack Chu Feng, hoping to test out the latter&rsquo;s true strength,</span><br><span>However, Chu Feng coolly turned around and left the scene.</span><br><span>Much to Qi Weidao&rsquo;s shock, Chu Feng was so fast that he couldn&rsquo;t even catch up at all despite having raised his cultivation to rank eight Half-God level. He could only helplessly put down his lifted God Armament.</span><br><span>This suggested that Chu Feng might have already reached rank nine Half-God level. Their people indeed wouldn&rsquo;t stand a chance against an enemy like that.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That fellow is actually that strong? It&rsquo;s no wonder Long Chengyu listens to him!&rdquo; Qi Weidao wiped off the cold sweat from his face.</span></p></div>
