        <div> - Demonic Woman&rsquo;s Origin<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>After the ancient spirit formation was broken through, the old monk stood up.<br>After he stood up, a total of a hundred world spirit gates appeared beside him.<br>The next moment, the hundred Demon Spirit World&rsquo;s world spirits that had concealed themselves all started to appear. They began to enter the world spirit gates in succession.<br>After he finished doing those things the old monk walked toward the coffin. After the coffin was opened, Chu Feng discovered that a woman was lying in the coffin.<br>This woman was very pleasant and sweet-looking. She was wearing a red muslin skirt, and appeared very natural, unrestrained and gave off a refined air. She was a rarely-seen beauty. However, she was already dead.<br>Even though her corpse was undamaged, Chu Feng was able to tell that she had been dead for a very long time, completely dead.<br>However, compared to the woman, Chu Feng was more surprised by the pearl she held between her hands.<br>That pearl was very large and could only be carried with two hands. That was also the reason why Chu Feng was able to notice it immediately.<br>The outside of the pearl was transparent. However, inside the pearl was a vortex.<br>That vortex was slowly revolving. It was somewhat strange. Furthermore, it was emitting an incomprehensible aura.<br>Although Chu Feng was unable to determine the usage of that pearl, Chu Feng was able to ascertain that the pearl was a treasure, a treasure more precious than all of the treasures outside of the coffin.<br>&ldquo;Do you wish to know who she is?&rdquo; The old monk asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;She is the demonic woman that you want to kill,&rdquo; The old monk said.<br>&ldquo;How could that be? She has clearly died a long time ago,&rdquo; Chu Feng said while pointing to the corpse in the coffin.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, she has died a long time ago. However, that does not mean that she is not the demonic woman that you want to kill,&rdquo; The old monk said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Senior, exactly what is going on?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;You wish to know?&rdquo; The old monk asked.<br>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>&ldquo;This demonic woman is called Zhao Hong. She is the daughter of the Reincarnation Sect&rsquo;s Sect Master, the ruler of the Reincarnation Upper Realm. She was a rarely seen martial cultivation genius.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;When she was only twenty years old, she replaced her father, who was over ten thousand years old, and became the new Sect Master of the Reincarnation Sect. At the same time, she also became the number one expert in the Reincarnation Sect.&rdquo;<br>Upon hearing that, Chu Feng felt shock. The Reincarnation Sect was actually the ruler of a world, and that Zhao Hong was actually the number one expert in the Reincarnation Sect. In other words, this meant that this woman by the name of Zhao Hong was an Upper Realm&rsquo;s strongest expert.<br>She was someone who became the strongest expert of an Upper Realm at the mere age of twenty. Oh how powerful of an existence she must be.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng finally realized what it meant to be a genius. When compared to an actual genius, he was simply not worth anything.<br>&ldquo;As Zhao Hong possessed outstanding talent, she would naturally also be proud and arrogant. As such, not a single man in the Reincarnation Upper Realm was able to catch her eyes.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, by coincidence, she arrived at the All Heaven Upper Realm, and got to know the strongest genius of the All Heaven Upper Realm, Liu Shuo.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Zhao Hong and Liu Shuo were the ideal couple. Furthermore, they fell in love at first sight. Soon, the two of them entered the river of love.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, Zhao Hong was taught by her father since she was a child to be wary of outsiders. As such, she was not someone who would trust easily.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even though she knew that her love for Liu Shuo was real, she was still on guard against him the entire time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It was only on the day of their marriage that Zhao Hong completely lowered her guard against Liu Shuo. However, she never would&rsquo;ve thought that she would end up being poisoned by Liu Shuo on the night of their marriage.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It turned out that Liu Shuo possessed exuberant ambitions, and was never truly in love with Zhao Hong. He had approached her all for the sake of obtaining the Reincarnation Pearl.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Zhao Hong was in enormous grief after discovering the truth. She felt enormous hatred toward Liu Shuo&rsquo;s deceit. Thus, she refused to tell Liu Shuo the whereabouts of the Reincarnation Pearl.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With that being the case, that Liu Shuo decided to use all means to obtain his goal. He began to cruelly torture Zhao Hong&rsquo;s family members in front of her, leaving them in miserable states, yet not allowing them to die.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Finally, enraged by the lack of results, Liu Shuo decided to kill all of Zhao Hong&rsquo;s family members right in front of her. His method were so very cruel that one&rsquo;s hackles would rise just by thinking about it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;At the moment when Zhao Hong&rsquo;s father was killed, Zhao Hong&rsquo;s bloodline suddenly exploded. She managed to overcome the poison that had erased her strength, and destroyed the spirit formation that had sealed her cultivation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, that Liu Shuo was very powerful. Even though Zhao Hong had managed to overcome the poison, she was still only equally matched with Liu Shuo. In the end, it concluded with both fighters injured and no victor to be seen.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Zhao Hong knew that this tragedy was caused by the Reincarnation Sect&rsquo;s Sect Protection Treasure, the Reincarnation Pearl.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;She did not wish for the Reincarnation Pearl to cause more harm. Thus, while she was still barely alive, she disappeared with the Reincarnation Pearl and concealed herself in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In the end, Zhao Hong ended up dying. She died here. However, the power of the Reincarnation Pearl caused her to rise from the dead.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Zhao Hong was reborn with grievances. After she was reborn, she lost all her memories, and her appearance became extremely ugly, resembling that of a monster.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is because the grievances of her past life are too strong that she began to detest men like she does now. She began to take joy in killing men, and started to eat their flesh.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Strangely, as Zhao Hong ate more men, her cultivation began to subsequently increase. Even though it was only her first resurrection, she had already reached a state where no one could stop her.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Fortunately, an expert from an Upper Realm passed by this region by coincidence and beheaded her.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, after killing the demonic woman, that expert was also seriously injured, and ended up dying. However, before dying, he used a special formation to turn his body and remaining power into a spring with water specializing in curbing evildoers.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for that&hellip; it became the Radiance Immortal Mountain&rsquo;s Demon Subduing Spring Water.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, the demonic woman possessed the Reincarnation Pearl on her actual body. Thus, after her death, she was reincarnated. It could be said that she possessed an undying body.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although she did end up losing all of her power with each resurrection, and had to cultivate all over again, her talent remained the same. This made it so that her cultivation speed was extremely fast.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, even though she forgot everything about her previous life with each resurrection, she still possessed the same sort of grievance. Thus, after she gained a certain amount of cultivation, she would start to instinctively hunt men, and repeat what she did in her previous lives,&rdquo; The old monk explained.<br>&ldquo;In that case, that means that the demonic woman cannot be killed?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;She can. As long as I take away that pearl, she will not be able to resurrect after she is killed again,&rdquo; As the old monk spoke, he extended his hand and made a grabbing motion. The Resurrection Pearl entered her hand.<br>&ldquo;Crash~~~&rdquo;<br>After the Resurrection Pearl entered his hand, the demonic woman&rsquo;s undamaged body instantly turned into dust. Not even her bones remained.<br>&ldquo;With this, she will no longer be able to resurrect,&rdquo; said the old monk.<br>Then, he turned to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;That demonic woman could be considered to be a pitiful individual. However, she is also abominable. If you plan to kill her, I will not stop you. Merely, your current strength is greatly insufficient.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thank you, senior, for your advice,&rdquo; Chu Feng clasped his fist and expressed his thanks.<br>&ldquo;You do not have to thank me for this. For the two of us to be able to meet twice here, it can be considered fate,&rdquo; The old monk said with a light smile.<br>&ldquo;Senior, since you are a Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, might you be willing to help this junior with one thing?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although this junior is unable to repay senior now, as long as you are willing to help me, this junior will definitely repay you in the future,&rdquo; Suddenly, Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; The old monk asked.<br>&ldquo;I possess a special world spirit in my body that has been sealed with a special formation. I have attempted to help her undo that spirit formation. However, she has entered deep sleep ever since.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I do not know when she will be able to wake up. However, I am very worried, since she has been asleep for so long. If possible, I hope that senior could help me attempt to remove that seal, help me wake her up,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;That is an insignificant matter. I am able to help you. Furthermore, I do not need you to repay me. I merely want you to answer a question of mine. However, you must answer truthfully,&rdquo; The old monk said.<br>&ldquo;Senior, please ask away,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You are most definitely not from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. Exactly which Heavenly Clan are you from?&rdquo; The old monk asked.<br>&ldquo;Senior, if I were to say that I do not belong to any Heavenly Clan, would you believe me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I would,&rdquo; The old monk smiled lightly. Then, he said, &ldquo;In that case, let me rephrase my question; which Heavenly Clan does your Heavenly Bloodline belong to?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Chu Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; Chu Feng did not conceal the matter. After all, he had a request for the old monk. Thus, since the old monk had only asked such a simple question, he would definitely answer honestly.<br>&ldquo;So it was the Chu Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; Hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s answer, the old monk nodded. Then, he said, &ldquo;It is the loss of the Chu Heavenly Clan to not treat you well.&rdquo;<br>This old monk was very intelligent. Merely from Chu Feng&rsquo;s answers, the old monk had determined that even though Chu Feng had come from the the Chu Heavenly Clan, he should be someone abandoned by them.<br><br></p></div>
