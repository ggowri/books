        <h1>Chapter 2726</h1>
        <div> - Two Options<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Chu Feng did not deny what the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master said.<br>The reason for that was because the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master had guessed correctly. Chu Feng had endured enormous pressure to unleash both the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword and the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe simultaneously.<br>And at that moment, Chu Feng was suffering from their backlash.<br>Actually, Chu Feng would not be reacting in such a manner if he had only used the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe.<br>However, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword&rsquo;s power was truly difficult to handle. Even now, Chu Feng was unable to bring forth its full power.<br>Thus, Chu Feng was already pushing himself to use martial skills while using the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword.<br>As for using the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe while using the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword, it would indeed be strange if it did not cause a backlash.<br>Of course, this was only for the current Chu Feng. Secret skills were miraculous techniques. As their master grew stronger, the power of secret skills would also grow stronger. Furthermore, a secret skill was also able to become more connected to its master and obtain a better mutual understanding before finally fusing together.<br>Chu Feng believed that as his cultivation increased, not only would he be able to gain better control over the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword, but he would also be able to unleash its true powers.<br>Merely, those would be things for the future, and not the present.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a medicinal pellet streaked across the air like a shooting star and stopped before Chu Feng.<br>It was an extremely strong medicinal pellet.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, take that medicinal pellet. It will be able to bring relief to the pain of your backlash,&rdquo; The Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master said to Chu Feng.<br>It was he who had tossed that medicinal pellet to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Thank you senior,&rdquo; This time around, Chu Feng did not refuse his goodwill. He immediately swallowed the medicinal pellet.<br>The reason for that was because he knew that this medicinal pellet could bring him relief. Furthermore, Chu Feng did not possess one such medicinal pellet on him.<br>In that sort of situation, there was no reason for Chu Feng to seek to impress others by pretending to be more capable. Thus, he naturally accepted the medicinal pellet.<br>After swallowing the medicinal pellet, a gentle power immediately entered Chu Feng&rsquo;s body and the depths of his soul.<br>If the pain of the backlash was akin to raging, burning flames incinerating Chu Feng&rsquo;s body and soul, then the power of the medicinal pellet would be akin to clear spring water.<br>Although the spring water was unable to completely extinguish the raging, burning flames, it was able to weaken its strength.<br>At that moment, as the power of the medicine started to spread through Chu feng&rsquo;s body, it was as the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master had said, and Chu Feng&rsquo;s pain had lessened greatly.<br>&ldquo;Thank you senior.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng looked to the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master and clasped his fist respectfully. He was expressing thanks for the effective medicinal pellet.<br>&ldquo;Those who have come are here as guests. Thus, little friend Chu Feng, there is no need for you to be this courteous. This is merely something that this old man should do,&rdquo; The Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master smiled faintly.<br>Then, he said, &ldquo;The hunting competition has ended. Right now, it is time to present the rewards. Little friends who have participated in the hunt, please take out the World Spirit Bones you all have obtained in the hunt, so that our Immortal Armament Villa can determine everyone&rsquo;s performance.&rdquo;<br>After the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master said those words, many of the participants in the hunt began to take out their World Spirit Bones.<br>Chu Feng was naturally no exception either. When Chu Feng revealed his World Spirit Bones, he inevitably caused an uproar again.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng simply possessed too many World Spirit Bones.<br>If the World Spirit Bones that others possessed could only pile up to a small mound, then the amount of World Spirit Bones Chu Feng possessed could pile up to a tall mountain. Even if all of the other participants&rsquo; World Spirit Bones were added together, they would still number far less than what Chu Feng had obtained by himself.<br>Such a comparison was simply too stunning.<br>&ldquo;Amazing!&rdquo;<br>Those people of the younger generation that had also participated in the hunt with Chu Feng all revealed admiration in their eyes as they looked to him.<br>The reason for that was because they had personally experienced the hunt for themselves. Thus, they knew very well how powerful the World Spirit Beasts were, as well as how difficult it was to acquire World Spirit Bones.<br>Thus, in addition to the fact that Chu Feng had obtained enough World Spirit Bones to pile up to a tall mountain, Chu Feng himself was a mountain in their eyes. He was a mountain peak that they would never be able to exceed in their entire lifetimes.<br>This was the disparity between a genius and ordinary people.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that the ranking in this hunting competition is obvious to all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This old man shall personally present the first place reward.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the people from the Immortal Armament Villa began to present rewards to the competitors according to their rankings.<br>As for the person that was presenting the reward to Chu Feng, it was actually the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master himself.<br>The Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master flew down from the viewing platform and arrived before Chu Feng.<br>He was holding a sword in his hand. That sword was silvery white in color. It was only three feet long and looked very short and small.<br>However, that sword was extremely exquisite. Not only was it very well crafted with carvings of a dragon and a phoenix, but its edges were also very sharp.<br>That sword was an Incomplete Immortal Armament. Furthermore, it was a top quality item.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, this sword is called the Dragon Phoenix Silver Stream. It is an Incomplete Immortal Armament that this old man has personally forged,&rdquo; The Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master said to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Wow! It&rsquo;s an Incomplete Immortal Armament forged personally by the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master!&rdquo;<br>The crowd exclaimed in admiration. This was especially true for the younger generations. They all revealed expressions of admiration.<br>Even if two items were both top quality Incomplete Immortal Armaments, as long as it was known to have been personally crafted by the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master, that Incomplete Immortal Armament would be much more valuable.<br>Naturally, others were feeling envious of the fact that Chu Feng had received such a reward.<br>Not to mention the younger generations, even the experts from the older generations were feeling envious of Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, this is your reward for obtaining first place in this hunt.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, there is actually another option for you,&rdquo; The Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master said.<br>Once the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master said those words, the expressions of the crowd present all changed.<br>Chu Feng managed to sense the change in their expressions. He felt that there would likely be something fishy in regard to the other option. It was possible that the other option might not be something good.<br>However, Chu Feng still asked curiously, &ldquo;Senior, what might the other option be?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You can choose to directly accept this Incomplete Immortal Armament and take it with you. You can also choose to renounce this Incomplete Immortal Armament and enter our Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Immortal Armament Armory.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In the Immortal Armament Armory are not only Incomplete Immortal Armaments, but also Immortal Armaments.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Through a special formation that is set up in the Immortal Armament Armory, the weapons inside are capable of detecting the talent of a person that enters it. If a person that enters the Immortal Armament Armory fulfills the requirement of a weapon inside, the weapons inside will let out a response. This is known as a resonance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Regardless of whether they might be Incomplete Immortal Armaments or Immortal Armaments, as long as they let out a resonance toward you, you will be allowed to choose a weapon among them as your reward,&rdquo; The Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master said.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s actually such a good thing? Chu Feng, since you already have the Divine Dragon&rsquo;s Blood Ruler as your Incomplete Immortal Armament, that so-called Dragon Phoenix Silver Stream would not be of much use to you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is better that we give that Immortal Armament Armory a try. If you happen to obtain an Immortal Armament from it, you would&rsquo;ve made a massive profit,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said excitedly.<br>To Her Lady Queen, this was akin to a game. Yet, it was also an opportunity.<br>Her Lady Queen wanted to give it a try.<br>&ldquo;Milady Queen, please don&rsquo;t be so anxious. Allow me to ask some more questions,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled faintly.<br>Then, he said to the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master, &ldquo;Lord Villa Master, I wish to ask if anyone has ever chosen to enter the Immortal Armament Armory through the various years of the hunting competition?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng wanted to know about the probability of success after entering the Immortal Armament Armory.<br><br><br></p></div>
