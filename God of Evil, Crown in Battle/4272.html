        <h1>Chapter 4271</h1>
        <div> - The Ruthless Ox-nose<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s alive?&rdquo;<br>Seeing Ox-nosed Old Daoist standing in the sky, the crowd were all in disbelief. But, they had no choice but to accept the fact that he was alive.<br>In terms of being shocked, the person most shocked by this was the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted. After all, he was the one who attacked Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>If this Ox-nosed fellow didn&rsquo;t die, wouldn&rsquo;t that mean that he managed to deceive him?<br>&ldquo;Ghost-face, Luo Tuo.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The two of you dared to so brazenly push around my disciple.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today, neither of you can think about leaving here alive,&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s actually threatening Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted and Grandmaster Luo Tuo?!&rdquo;<br>Even though the crowd were surprised by the fact that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was still alive, they still find things to be inconceivable after hearing those words from the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>After all, they still believed the Ox-nosed Old Daoist to be a nameless nobody.<br>The Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted and Grandmaster Luo Tuo, on the other hand, were one of the strongest world spiritists in the Holy Light Galaxy beneath only the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted.<br>How could a nameless nobody dare to speak that sort of thing to people like them?!<br>&ldquo;Reckless fellow.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Instead of fleeing at once after escaping by fluke, you actually dared to return to court death?&rdquo;<br>Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s complexion turned gloomy. Then, his killing intent swept forth and filled the air. He was planning to attack the Ox-nosed Old Daoist again.<br>Furthermore, he was not planning to allow the Ox-nosed Old Daoist to escape alive this time.<br>&ldquo;Woosh---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist attacked. He actually took the initiative.<br>He extended his arm and grabbed toward the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted from afar.<br>&ldquo;Wuuu---&rdquo;<br>Immediately after, the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted revealed a painful look. He grabbed his neck with his hands seemingly wanting to break free from something.<br>Upon closer inspection, the crowd discovered that there was an invisible yet powerful hand grabbing onto the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s neck.<br>That hand was grabbing so hard that his neck was about to snap into two. Judging from the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s painful expression, the hand was not only causing harm to his physical body. Instead, it was tormenting his soul too.<br>The crowd were greatly alarmed upon seeing this scene. Not to mention the others, even experts like Grandmaster Luo Tuo and Celestial Fairy Muzhi revealed looks of panic.<br>They all knew that the person clenching the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s neck was none other than the Ox-nosed Old Daoist that they looked down upon.<br>&ldquo;Ghost-face, don&rsquo;t blame me for being ruthless.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You were the one who brought this upon yourself.&rdquo;<br>With a beaming smile on his face, Ox-nosed Old Daoist said to Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted.<br>After he finished saying those words, he tightened his grasp. &ldquo;Snap,&rdquo; Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s neck snapped apart.<br>After Ox-nosed Old Daoist released his grasp, the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted fell flat onto the ground, completely motionless.<br>Dead. This rank one Martial Exalted level expert, this powerful world spiritist that had grasped rank four Dragon Transformation Sensation, was killed just like this.<br>Ox-nosed Old Daoist killed him like snapping the neck of a chicken.<br>&ldquo;This guy!!!&rdquo;<br>At this moment, many people&rsquo;s faces turned deathly pale with fear.<br>&ldquo;Bang---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a muffled explosion was heard. At the same time, a figure disappeared.<br>It was Grandmaster Luo Tuo.<br>Realizing that the situation had turned bad, he immediately snapped apart a teleportation talisman to flee.<br>&ldquo;Buzz---&rdquo;<br>But, at practically the same time he snapped apart his teleportation talisman, then heaven and earth underwent a transformation.<br>Dazzling light and invisible power scattered down from above and covered vast surroundings.<br>That was&hellip; martial power and spirit power&hellip; a dual layered oppressive might.<br>&ldquo;What a powerful world spirit technique. Could that be rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation?!&rdquo;<br>Everyone present was able to sense how powerful that world spirit technique was.<br>Likewise, they were also able to sense how powerful the martial power was.<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist finally revealed his strength to the crowd.<br>He released the spirit power of a rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation.<br>At the same time, he also unleashed the oppressive might of a rank two Martial Exalted.<br>&ldquo;This old codger, he had regained his strength from back then?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;A genius like him is truly enviable.&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen was overjoyed after sensing the current aura displayed by the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen was the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s close friend for many years and had kept connections with him ever since the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was plotted against by his friend.<br>He knew that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist lost everything back then. As such, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s current cultivation and world spirit techniques could be said to be all things that he trained for anew.<br>When they last met, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist still did not possess his current strength.<br>In fact, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s current strength even slightly surpassed his strength from back then.<br>Back then, his cultivation was only that of a rank one Martial Exalted. But now, it was rank two Martial Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Eeeahhh---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a scream was heard.<br>THen, a figure appeared from afar.<br>It was Grandmaster Luo Tuo.<br>Grandmaster Luo Tuo did not manage to escape. Instead, he was stopped by the Ox-nosed Old Daoist using his dual layer of powers.<br>Grandmaster Luo Tuo was violently struggling. At the same time, he was pleading for forgiveness.<br>&ldquo;Brother, this is a misunderstanding. This is all a misunderstanding.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although I have a foul mouth, I&rsquo;ve never had any intention to cause harm to young friend Chu Feng. Brother, you mustn&rsquo;t kill an innocent person.&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Luo Tuo was renowned for his fiery temper. Yet, at this time, he was unable to show the slightest bit of his temper. He was so frightened that it seemed like he was on the verge of crying.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that he was cowardly.<br>After he personally witnessed how the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted was killed that easily, how could he, someone with strength on par with the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted, not be afraid?<br>&ldquo;If you knew what would happen today, why did you act like that before?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Luo Tuo, you only have yourself to blame for this. You shouldn&rsquo;t have provoked my disciple.&rdquo;<br>After the Ox-nosed Old Daoist finished saying those words, he sent forth a palm explosively.<br>Then, the space trembled and an enormous palm dropped from the sky.<br>That palm contained a power stronger than even rank two Martial Exalted&rsquo;s oppressive might.<br>That was a martial skill. The speed at which that palm descends was not fast. But, Grandmaster Luo Tuo was unable to escape it at all.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that he didn&rsquo;t want to avoid the palm. It&rsquo;s just that he was fixed in place by the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s oppressive might.<br>&ldquo;Please spare me! I will give you all the treasures I have!&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Luo Tuo was begging for forgiveness. He was in so much panic and fear that even his tone had turned sobbing.<br>But, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist remained completely unmoved.<br>The enormous hand continued to descend from the sky. Finally, it arrived before Grandmaster Luo Tuo. Compared to the hand, Grandmaster Luo Tuo seemed as small as an ant.<br>It was like a giant mountain was about to crush him.<br>&ldquo;Boom----&rdquo;<br>The earth trembled. Cracks extended all over.<br>When a crater so large and deep that the bottom cannot be seen appeared before the crowd, Grandmaster Luo Tuo&rsquo;s silhouette disappeared completely.<br>But, Grandmaster Luo Tuo&rsquo;s Cosmos Sack and his treasures were still at the bottom of the crater.<br>Without a doubt, Grandmaster Luo Tuo died. But, his death was even more miserable than the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s death.<br>At least the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted died with an intact corpse.<br>Grandmaster Luo Tuo, on the other hand, was completely annihilated.<br>&ldquo;Ssss---&rdquo;<br>Seeing the surging thick smoke from the deep crater, many people gasped with shock and felt a chill run down their spine.<br>The enormous hand that descended from the sky was still vivid in their mind.<br>From that aura, that might and that power, the crowd realized that if that Ox-nose wanted to, it would not only be Grandmaster Tang Chen that ends up dead today. Instead, all of them could be killed by that palm.<br>That was the might of a rank two Martial Exalted.<br>It was a power far surpassed Utmost Exalteds and even rank one Martial Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Terrifying! That&rsquo;s Chu Feng&rsquo;s master?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Never would I expect that there&rsquo;s such a master hidden in our Holy Light Galaxy.&rdquo;<br>The crowd were no longer looking at the Ox-nosed Old Daoist with contempt. Instead, fear and reverence filled their eyes.<br>This Ox-nosed fellow was much more terrifying than they imagined.<br>Not only was he someone with great power, he was also extremely ruthless.<br>When other people kill others, they would either be expressionless or have a look of fierceness and malevolence.<br>But, that was not the case for him. He remained smiling the entire time. It was a smile of indifference.<br>It seemed as if killing the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted and Grandmaster Luo Tuo, two grand characters whose names resounded throughout the Holy Light Galaxy, was nothing more than a trivial matter to him.<br>At this moment, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist extended his hand and made a grabbing motion. Marital power surged forth.<br>The Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted and Grandmaster Luo Tuo&rsquo;s treasures all flew up and into his hand.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken care of these two head troublemakers.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, you all, people who insulted my precious disciple, you needed to provide me with an explanation too.&rdquo;<br>After placing away the treasures, Ox-nosed Old Daoist swept his smiling gaze across the hundreds of millions of people below.<br>&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo;<br>The crowd below all turned ashen with fear upon hearing those words.<br>Could it be that this Ox-nosed fellow was planning to kill them too?!<br></p></div>
