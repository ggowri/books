        <div>: Heading Into the Ancient Remnant<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Those were life talismans, right? Could that be related to the members of the Situ World Spiritist Clan we encountered at the Zhuge Clan? Are they wounded by young friend Chu Feng?&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei asked via voice transmission.<br>They had witnessed everything that had happened earlier while remaining concealed by Daoist Niantian&rsquo;s means.<br>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t look like it. Judging from Situ Zhonglan&rsquo;s reaction, those life talismans only turned tattered a moment ago. Otherwise, it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense for her to suddenly leave in such a hurry,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian replied.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, what do you think?&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei asked.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s related to me either. The only one who knows what truly happened is Situ Zhonglan herself. However, judging from how those life talismans are still working, I&rsquo;m guessing that the members of the Situ World Spiritist Clan aren&rsquo;t too far away from here,&rdquo; Chu Feng murmured.<br>&ldquo;Hard to say. Given the means of the Situ World Spiritist Clan, they should be able to craft highly potent life talismans, though I doubt that it would work across galaxies,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian analyzed.<br>&ldquo;That means that it could be the group from the Situ World Spiritist Clan we encountered at the Zhuge Clan. If so, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before Situ Zhonglan learns about my affairs. It looks like we&rsquo;ll have to hurry. We need to leave this place before Situ Zhonglan returns,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, let&rsquo;s kill these people and head to the ancient remnant,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei said.<br>He was referring to Qiu Long and the others. He hadn&rsquo;t forgotten how those people kept making things hard for Chu Feng even though there was no grudge between them. Chu Feng had only tolerated them was because he was worried about Situ Zhonglan&rsquo;s interference.<br>But now that Situ Zhonglan was gone, there was no one who could pose a threat to Chu Feng anymore given that he had Shengguang Baimei backing him. Naturally, this meant that it was time to exact vengeance.<br>While Chu Feng was chatting with Shengguang Baimei, Song Yun had also started interrogating Qiu Long.<br>&ldquo;Miss Song, you&rsquo;re really mistaken. I wasn&rsquo;t the one who gave Chu Feng away. It really isn&rsquo;t me!&rdquo;<br>Qiu Long&rsquo;s earlier gleeful smile was nowhere to be seen. It was replaced with a look of indignance.<br>&ldquo;Do you take me for a fool? Who else could have done it other than you? You&rsquo;re really asking for a beating! You must have thought that my big brother Chu Feng is a pushover. Big sis, let&rsquo;s teach them a lesson!&rdquo;<br>It went without saying that Song Yun didn&rsquo;t believe Qiu Long&rsquo;s lies.<br>&ldquo;Forget it, Yun&rsquo;er. Let&rsquo;s wait for your mother to return before deciding on how we should deal with them.&rdquo;<br>Song Xue&rsquo;er chose not to make a move. She was concerned about the implications since it was the Godwish Grandmother and<br>Lady of Dao Sea who invited these people here.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to deal with them, but it could potentially land the Godwish Grandmother and<br>Lady of Dao Sea in trouble. Let&rsquo;s call it quits today. We&rsquo;ll settle the scores with them in the future,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;It looks like young friend Chu Feng is much more meticulous than you are, Lord Baimei,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian said.<br>As much as he was complimenting Chu Feng, that remark was also an insult directed toward Shengguang Baimei as well. Even though Shengguang Baimei was much older than Chu Feng, he was used to being in a dominant position. Due to that, there were times when he wasn&rsquo;t as good at dealing with interpersonal relationships as Chu Feng.<br>Shengguang Baimei couldn&rsquo;t stand Daoist Niantian&rsquo;s insult, but he chose to swallow it down because Chu Feng was around too. He rolled his eyes at Daoist Niantian before replying to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go with what you said.&rdquo;<br>Having decided on their next course of action, Chu Feng called Song Yun, Song Xue&rsquo;er, and Song Feifei into one of the palaces with him and relayed two matters to them.<br>One, he had entered the underground palace by coincidence. He actually wasn&rsquo;t invited by<br>Lady of Dao Sea. He had only lied earlier on because he could tell that Qiu Long was intentionally making things difficult for him.<br>Two, he had urgent matters to deal with so he needed to leave the place.<br>Song Yun, Song Xue&rsquo;er, and Song Feifei could understand why Chu Feng would lie about being invited by<br>Lady of Dao Sea, so they didn&rsquo;t blame him for that.<br>As for the second matter, while Song Feifei remained mostly calm, Song Xue&rsquo;er and Song Yun grew agitated. Song Yun even rushed forward to grab Chu Feng, as if fearing that he would flee at the next moment.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, don&rsquo;t be in such a rush to leave. Haven&rsquo;t you heard that we&rsquo;re at the Monstrous King&rsquo;s Soul Mound? My mother spent many years gathering many items just to open the mound! You might just stumble upon a fortuitous encounter if you enter the mound with us!&rdquo; Song Yun said.<br>&ldquo;How long will it take for the Monstrous King&rsquo;s Soul Mound to open?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was moved by the offer since he was in a rush to raise his cultivation level. The Holy Valley&rsquo;s ancient remnant was an opportunity to him, but so was the Monstrous King&rsquo;s Soul Mound.<br>&ldquo;Regarding that&hellip; it&rsquo;s hard to say. The Monstrous King has set up many dangerous defensive mechanisms around the mound, so we&rsquo;ll have to take things slowly. It might take some time,&rdquo; Song Yun replied.<br>&ldquo;How about this? I&rsquo;ll first handle the other matter I have on hand, and I&rsquo;ll rush over if I can make it back in time,&rdquo; Chu Feng proposed.<br>&ldquo;How long will you be gone for? Do you need help? If you&rsquo;re in trouble, why don&rsquo;t my big sis and I accompany you?&rdquo; Song Yun asked.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I can handle it myself. You can stay here,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>Song Yun wasn&rsquo;t willing to let things rest with that, but she had no choice but to back down since Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t going to change his mind.<br>He left the city afterward and made his way toward the ancient remnant under Shengguang Baimei&rsquo;s lead.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, it looks like you have good luck with women. I noticed that many of the young misses are interested in you, but I think that only three of them are worthy of you. Song Yun and Song Xue&rsquo;er are a good fit, and Song Feifei&hellip; She does have a decent appearance and is the disciple of<br>Lady of Dao Sea, so she barely meets the cut too,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei said cheerily.<br>&ldquo;Elder Baimei, they are just my friends,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, they will be heartbroken to hear that. You might think of them as friends, but I don&rsquo;t think that they are happy with just beings friends with you. Even Song Xue&rsquo;er looks at you with peculiar eyes despite her cold front. I have been through this phase myself. I&rsquo;m certain that Song Xue&rsquo;er has feelings for you.<br>&ldquo;You can toss aside Song Feifei if you aren&rsquo;t interested in her, but you shouldn&rsquo;t let Song Yun and Song Xue&rsquo;er down,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei advised.<br>&ldquo;Lord Baimei, if you have been through that phase yourself, shouldn&rsquo;t you be able to tell that young friend Chu Feng doesn&rsquo;t harbor any feelings for them? You&rsquo;re putting him in a spot with your words,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian interjected, alleviating the awkward atmosphere for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Elder Niantian, a loner like you shouldn&rsquo;t mislead young hero Chu Feng with your warped philosophies. Isn&rsquo;t it perfectly normal for a man to have multiple wives? Do you really need to have feelings for someone to get together with them? In my opinion, it&rsquo;s enough as long as they are pretty!&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei said.<br>&ldquo;Elder Baimei, I know that you&rsquo;re saying this out of goodwill, but I&rsquo;d prefer to devote myself to people whom I have feelings for. I believe that a couple needs to have mutual feelings in order to be happy. Otherwise, I will only be making myself uncomfortable while hindering the other party&rsquo;s pursuit for happiness,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;It looks like young hero Chu Feng is a sentimental man. Still, I don&rsquo;t think that men should be too fussy when the lady doesn&rsquo;t mind it. I think that you&rsquo;re just overthinking things,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei said.<br>Chu Feng responded with a simple shake of his head. It was futile to argue about this with Shengguang Baimei. The two of them had led vastly different lives, so it was inevitable that their values would be different as well.<br>It was futile to attempt to convince another person of his own values.<br>Besides, it was indeed common for men to have multiple wives in this huge world of cultivation. There were even some who had tens of thousands of wives.<br>&ldquo;We have arrived.&rdquo;<br>All of a sudden, Shengguang Baimei halted his footsteps.<br>They were standing in the midst seemingly ordinary grass field, but when Shengguang Baimei took out his formation key, a spirit formation gate manifested in front of them.<br>The three of them quickly entered the spirit formation gate.<br></p></div>
