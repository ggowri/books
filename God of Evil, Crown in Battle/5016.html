        <h1>Chapter 5015</h1>
        <div>: A Powerful Existence<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;W-who in the world are you?&rdquo; the Netherworld Envoy asked in apprehension.<br>The Netherworld Envoy wasn&rsquo;t a cowardly individual who was afraid of trouble, but the other party was simply too powerful that he couldn&rsquo;t help but feel intimidated.<br>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t qualified to know my father&rsquo;s name. All you have to do is to heed his instructions, or else there&rsquo;s no guarantee that you&rsquo;ll be able to keep your head,&rdquo; the little boy replied.<br>His voice was that of an adult despite his ten-year-old appearance, making for an eerie contrast.<br>However, the Netherworld Envoy wasn&rsquo;t too surprised by that. Nothing else seemed important in comparison to the terrifying might displayed by the middle-aged man.<br>&ldquo;You need not know who I am. You just have to do as you&rsquo;re told,&rdquo; the middle-aged man replied.<br>The Netherworld Envoy dared not to hesitate before such a terrifying individual. He obediently took the sleeping little girl out and passed her over to the middle-aged man before taking his leave.<br>&ldquo;Remember this. You mustn&rsquo;t talk about me before Chu Feng. Don&rsquo;t let him know that I&rsquo;ve looked for you. Also, I shall remind you that your job is to safely escort Chu Feng back to the Nine Souls Galaxy. If anything happens to him along the way, you won&rsquo;t be the only one to take the fall. I&rsquo;ll massacre every single person your Netherworld Sect has in the Nine Souls Galaxy.&rdquo;<br>The middle-aged man&rsquo;s voice remained calm from the start to the end, but that only made his threat even more terrifying.<br>After those words were spoken, both the middle-aged man and little boy vanished amidst the fog. Soon, the fog started to dissipate.<br>Finally, the Netherworld Envoy was able to see Chu Feng once more.<br>The latter was standing right next to him, staring intently at him with curiosity in his eyes.<br>Chu Feng had no idea what the Netherworld Envoy had been through, but the latter suddenly stood still on the spot after those from the Heavenwind Sword Sect left. He couldn&rsquo;t understand what the Netherworld Envoy was up to since the latter wasn&rsquo;t even answering his questions at all.<br>He knew that it was impossible for someone of his cultivation to escape from the Netherworld Envoy, so he had no choice but to stand his ground and wait.<br>&ldquo;I&hellip; haven&rsquo;t moved a step since earlier?&rdquo; the Netherworld Envoy asked Chu Feng.<br>He remembered moving after the fog had set in, but somehow, his position had reverted to that before the arrival of the fog. This made him realize that what had happened earlier didn&rsquo;t occur in the physical world but in his subconscious mind.<br>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t you be aware whether you have moved or not?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Sss!&rdquo;<br>The Netherworld Envoy breathed in deeply.<br>He knew from the middle-aged man&rsquo;s oppressive might that he stood no chance against the latter, but even so, he couldn&rsquo;t discern the other party&rsquo;s level of cultivation at all. If the middle-aged man was able to slip into a person&rsquo;s subconscious mind on top of that, his means would truly be incredible.<br>The middle-aged man wasn&rsquo;t boasting when he said that he would massacre every member the Netherworld Sect had in the Nine Souls Galaxy if he failed to escort Chu Feng safely back to the Nine Souls Galaxy. The middle-aged man did have the power to pull that off.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you certain that you would like to return to the Nine Souls Galaxy?&rdquo; the Netherworld Envoy asked.<br>&ldquo;Elder, I really wish to go back. A life is at stake here.&rdquo;<br>This was a chance for him to convince the Netherworld Envoy. As unlikely as it was for the Netherworld Envoy to heed his words, he still wanted to give it a try.<br>&ldquo;Very well. I&rsquo;ll take you back,&rdquo; the Netherworld Envoy said.<br>As he spoke, he began taking Chu Feng toward the ancient teleportation formation. It was such an abrupt change of mind that Chu Feng was left utterly bewildered.<br>&ldquo;Elder, a-are you really taking me back to the Nine Souls Galaxy?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng thought that the situation was so incredulous that he even stumbled over his words.<br>In the first place, it was due to the Netherworld Envoy&rsquo;s obstinacy in taking him to the Netherworld Sect that he was forced to ask the Heavenwind Sword Sect for help. He thought that the Netherworld Envoy would punish him for his defiance, but the Netherworld Envoy chose to take him back to the Nine Souls Galaxy instead.<br>The change in attitude simply didn&rsquo;t make sense.<br>Chu Feng racked his brain but was unable to make sense of the situation.<br>&ldquo;I mean what I say. Is there anywhere you wish to go? I&rsquo;ll bring you there?&rdquo; the Netherworld Envoy said.<br>&ldquo;Elder, there&rsquo;s no need to trouble you. I can return on my own too.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was worried that the Netherworld Envoy would change his mind halfway through, so he wanted to shake off the Netherworld Envoy and return on his own.<br>&ldquo;You do realize that we&rsquo;re currently in the Totem Galaxy, a long distance away from the Nine Souls Galaxy. It might not have taken long for us to reach here, but that&rsquo;s only because I was the one bringing you along. You&rsquo;ll take far longer than you can imagine if you return there on your own. By the time, the friend you wish to save might have already lost her life,&rdquo; the Netherworld Envoy said.<br>Chu Feng thought that those words made sense. He had seen how fast the Netherworld Envoy had traveled along the way, and that was not something the current him could match.<br>Besides, the Netherworld Envoy didn&rsquo;t appear to be a scheming individual despite his obstinate views. Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t think that there was any reason why the other party would lie to him all of a sudden.<br>So, he revealed the location he was intending to head to.<br>Fortunately, he had chatted with the Godwish Grandmother along the way and learned where the Sagacious Grandmaster was at, so he could directly head there. He figured that it was likely that he would meet the Godwish Grandmother and the others there too.<br>Even though Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t think that the Netherworld Envoy would lie to him, he was still a little worried about it. He couldn&rsquo;t tell if the Netherworld Envoy was earnest about helping him or not.<br>It was only when the Netherworld Envoy really brought him into the ancient teleportation formation and brought him back the way where they came from that Chu Feng finally believed it.<br>&ldquo;Elder&hellip; may I know why you suddenly changed your mind?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was simply too curious to know what had happened for the Netherworld Envoy to change his stance so abruptly.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother asking about it. You just need to know that I&rsquo;ll send you back. You don&rsquo;t have to come to the Netherworld Sect with me anymore,&rdquo; the Netherworld Envoy said.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked in bewilderment.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; the Netherworld Envoy replied affirmatively.<br>Chu Feng was even more confused upon hearing those words.<br>He could tell that the Netherworld Envoy was an inflexible person who would go to all lengths to do what he had decided on. There was likely to be a compelling reason why the Netherworld Envoy was so intent on bringing him to the Netherworld Sect. It might be possible that he was entrusted with an important mission.<br>Considering that Chu Feng had successfully taken in the Netherworld Embryo, it made no sense for the Netherworld Envoy to let him go.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask any further. You&rsquo;ll know the truth one day,&rdquo; the Netherworld Envoy replied.<br>Elder, what if&hellip; I wish to enter the Netherworld Sect on my own accord?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br></p></div>
