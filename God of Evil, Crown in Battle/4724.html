        <div>: Teaching Chu Feng a Lesson<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Chu Feng, you still dare to come down after what you did!&rdquo;<br>Xia Ran had been staring intently at Chu Feng, and he saw the latter leaping down from the peak with his own eyes. Surprisingly, he didn&rsquo;t make a move on Chu Feng right away but emanated his oppressive might instead.<br>Seeing this sight, the crowd quickly turned their gazes upon the two of them once more, interested to see what would happen. They knew that they could enjoy yet another drama.<br>It would take some time for the light to finish forming, so they needed to wait anyway. Any entertainment was more than welcomed now.<br>Bi Jingjing walked over to Xia Ran&rsquo;s side and said, &ldquo;Senior Xia, there could be some misunderstanding. Let&rsquo;s clarify things first.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Junior Bi, you&rsquo;ve heard what Fang Yunshi said earlier. What misunderstanding could there be? Are you saying that the words from the disciples of our South Vermilion Hall are untrustworthy?&rdquo; Xia Ran asked.<br>Even though Xia Ran was domineering, he had always been quite polite to Bi Jingjing. In fact, had it been anyone else who asked him that question, he would have resorted to his fists right away. He wouldn&rsquo;t have bothered explaining at all.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what&rsquo;s going on. Why did you beat up our disciples?&rdquo;<br>Unwilling to give up, she took the initiative to question Chu Feng instead. She really didn&rsquo;t want to see the two of them making enemies out of one another.<br>&ldquo;Senior Bi, the situation is very straightforward. Fang Yunshi and the other disciple from your South Vermilion Sect stole an item from our North Tortoise Sect&rsquo;s Song Xi and injured him. Since they were the ones who first violated the rules of our sect, isn&rsquo;t it normal for me to return the favor? Besides, I&rsquo;ve already gone easy on them. Had it been anyone else, they wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to live to tell the tale,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Are you saying that you would have killed us? Hah, what arrogant words!&rdquo; Fang Yunshi bellowed at Chu Feng angrily.<br>Now that he was standing beside Xia Ran, he was able to find his confidence once more.<br>&ldquo;Fang Yunshi, tell me the truth. Were you the one who stole Song Xi&rsquo;s item first?&rdquo; Bi Jingjing asked.<br>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t! It&rsquo;s Song Xi who stole my item. If you don&rsquo;t believe me, you can ask the others. They can testify for me!&rdquo; Fang Yunshi said.<br>Following that, some people actually stepped forward to speak on Fang Yunshi&rsquo;s behalf. They weren&rsquo;t just limited to the disciples of the South Vermilion Hall; some from the East Dragon Hall and West Dragon Hall spoke up too.<br>Given the circumstances, even if Bi Jingjing wanted to help Chu Feng, there was very little she could do.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, do you see that? Fang Yunshi has eye-witnesses here!&rdquo; Xia Ran looked at Chu Feng gleefully as he said.<br>He could tell that these people were lying, but that wasn&rsquo;t important. This was what he wanted anyway. The more wronged Chu Feng was, the more delighted he would be. He wanted to suppress the latter with his influence.<br>&ldquo;I can testify for Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>Song Xi suddenly spoke up then.<br>However, no one else stepped forward to say a word other than him. In fact, Wang Ziyan, Hei Yao, and Ma Yu, who explained about the Snowdomain Divine Palace to him earlier, were still up at the peak. They didn&rsquo;t even dare to come down, let alone testify for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Pui! The two of you are on the same side, so who would believe your testimony?&rdquo; Xia Ran scoffed in disdain.<br>The others also started jeering at Chu Feng and Song Xi.<br>In the blink of an eye, Chu Feng and Song Xi had been completely isolated from the crowd.<br>Song Xi was a little panicked. They were already lacking in terms of strength and background, and if they couldn&rsquo;t claim the legitimacy here too, things could really turn out bad. Fear could be seen on his face.<br>One must know that they weren&rsquo;t just dealing Fang Yunshi here, but Xia Ran and those from the East Dragon Hall and West Tiger Hall too. There were some disciples in the East Dragon Hall and West Tiger Hall who were stronger than Xia Ran, but they chose to stand with Xia Ran. How could he not panic in such a situation?<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;<br>Sensing Song Xi&rsquo;s fear, Chu Feng patted his shoulder with a smile. Seeing how confident Chu Feng was, Song Xi suddenly recalled the things they had gone through back at the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>He was incredibly weak back then, and it was Chu Feng who kept protecting him. Chu Feng was his idol, a person whom he looked up to and sought to become.<br>Those forgotten feelings were suddenly returning to him once more, leaving him feeling a little nostalgic.<br>&ldquo;Lord Protector, the truth is already out. I ask of you to redress our grievances!&rdquo; Xia Ran shouted loudly.<br>As it turned out, the reason why he hadn&rsquo;t made a move on Chu Feng thus far was because he feared Protector Zhao. However, it appeared that the protector was present at the moment, as evidence by how the other party didn&rsquo;t appear when Xia Ran called out for him.<br>&ldquo;Lord Protector, the disciples of our South Vermilion Hall have been beaten up for no reason. I can&rsquo;t just turn a blind eye to that. If you can&rsquo;t make a move on our behalf, we can only exact justice on our own accord. I ask you not to blame us for that!&rdquo;<br>Xia Ran seemed to be really fearful of the protector. He first clasped his fist toward his surroundings as a sign of respect before finally directing a cold glare at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, it&rsquo;s too late even if you kneel down and admit your mistakes right now. I&rsquo;ll make you pay the price for your folly!&rdquo;<br>Right after those words were spoken, he directed his oppressive might toward Chu Feng, stirring great winds that sent the disciples in the vicinity backing away. However, before his oppressive might could come close to Chu Feng, it suddenly dissipated without a trace.<br>It was as if a river had fallen into a sea far greater than itself, unable to stir any significant ripples at all.<br>It was a bewildering situation that confused the spectators and even Xia Ran himself. He was worried that the protector had made a move once more to guard Chu Feng.<br>Boom!<br>But in the next moment, a powerful oppressive might suddenly burst out from Chu Feng, pushing away all of the disciples around Chu Feng except for Song Xi.<br>It was the oppressive might of a rank six Utmost Exalted level.<br>&ldquo;Rank six Utmost Exalted level? Chu Feng, you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Sensing Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation, Bi Jingjing widened her mouth in shock. Even Xia Ran was stunned as well.<br>Wasn&rsquo;t Chu Feng supposed to be at rank one Utmost Exalted level? How could he command the strength of a rank six then?<br>&ldquo;Why are you so surprised? I&rsquo;ve already revealed my cultivation on top earlier on. Ah, I guess Fang Yunshi&rsquo;s mouth is so filled with lies that he didn&rsquo;t bother telling you my current cultivation level. Oh well, I guess that&rsquo;s to be expected. If he had told the truth, you wouldn&rsquo;t have foolishly stepped forward for his sake.<br>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that so, Fang Yunshi?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng specially turned his gaze toward Fang Yunshi as he said those words.<br>Under Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze, Fang Yunshi&rsquo;s complexion turned pale.<br>&ldquo;Senior Xia, I didn&rsquo;t intend to hide it from you. I just&hellip; wasn&rsquo;t able to say it in time,&rdquo; he hurriedly explained.<br>It just so happened that Xia Ran turned to look at him at the same moment too, just that his eyes were freezingly cold, leaving Fang Yunshi gulping in fear.<br>Xia Ran was indeed angered, but he chose to leave this grudge for later on. He knew that the South Vermilion Hall should remain united, at least in the face of outsiders.<br>&ldquo;Rank six Utmost Exalted level. It&rsquo;s no wonder why you dare to act so arrogantly. It turns out that you had something to fall back on. But did you just say that I wouldn&rsquo;t dare to make a move on you? Hahaha! I really have to put you back in your place then!&rdquo;<br>Xia Ran pointed a finger at Chu Feng.<br>Boom!<br>A concentrated burst of martial power gushed forth in the form of a spiraling hurricane. It swiftly morphed into countless golden spears before raining down on Chu Feng.<br>This was an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill. Even though it was just a rank one Exalted Taboo, its prowess was far greater than that of ordinary martial skills.<br>This showed just how much Xia Ran hated Chu Feng, or else he wouldn&rsquo;t have resorted to such a vicious move right from the start.<br></p></div>
