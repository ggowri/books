        <h1>Chapter 5593: The Neighboring Bidder</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, I still have matters to attend to, so I&rsquo;m afraid that I&rsquo;ll have to take my leave first,&rdquo; the elder said. He turned to the attendants inside the room and instructed, &ldquo;This man is one of our most important clients. Make sure to serve him well.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ten female attendants heard those words loud and clear, which was why they were exceptionally passionate when it came to serving Chu Feng. Some of them even tried to flirt with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flirting with the customers was not a part of the female attendants&rsquo; responsibilities, and there were even rules prohibiting customers from going overboard with the female attendants. Yet, the female attendants still did it of their own volition because they realized that Chu Feng was not an ordinary person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to serve me.&rdquo; Chu Feng raised his hand and indicated he wasn&rsquo;t interested in their service.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ten female attendants quickly reverted to their dignified states and backed to the side. Unless Chu Feng spoke, they would maintain their silence. They would only step </span><span>forward to fill Chu Feng&rsquo;s teacup after he took a sip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng had to concede that they were highly-skilled attendants adept at reading the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the elder was heading back in the direction where he came from, with the woman who had first received Chu Feng trailing behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The latter couldn&rsquo;t understand what was so special about Chu Feng to deserve such privileges. In fact, she was perplexed as to why the elder wasn&rsquo;t doubting Chu Feng&rsquo;s claim that he had received the God Armament from the Totem Dragon Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, the elder told the woman the events that had transpired on Painter Mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It looks like Chu Feng is on good terms with the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s young master, but even if Chu Feng harnesses great potential in him, I still can&rsquo;t imagine the Totem Dragon Clan gifting a God Armament to him just like that,&rdquo; the woman raised her concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng has already openly revealed his God Armament to us. Do you think he&rsquo;d have done so if he had stolen it? You should know how difficult it is to steal from the Totem Dragon Clan,&rdquo; the elder said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true&hellip;&rdquo; The woman agreed that it was unlikely for Chu Feng to have stolen it; it was more likely that he had received it as a gift from the Totem Dragon Clan. &ldquo;But still, it&rsquo;s the God Armament we&rsquo;re talking about here&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What do you think it means for the Totem Dragon Clan to gift an invaluable God Armament to someone else? It means that Chu Feng possesses something we are unaware of! How could we not befriend someone like that?&rdquo; the elder exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those words enlightened the woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Totem Dragon Clan was not a fool. The only reason they would invest a God Armament in Chu Feng was that they believed that he was worth its price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I am humbled by your wisdom,&rdquo; the woman said with a respectful tone, but her face soon frowned in worry. &ldquo;I slighted him upon learning that he intends to auction for the Blood Gathering Red Lotus. What should I do if Chu Feng harbors a grudge against me for that?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elder chuckled upon hearing those words. &ldquo;Rest assured. Based on what I have heard and seen from him today, Chu Feng is not a narrow-minded person. He won&rsquo;t harbor a grudge over trifling matters like this.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman was still worried about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Rest assured, I have a sharp eye for people.&rdquo; The elder was confident that Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t exact vengeance on the woman over something as minor as this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I need you to head to the auction hall now to remind the auctioneer to shorten our introduction of the Blood Gathering Red Lotus. There&rsquo;s no need to elaborate on its origin or the strength of the beasts protecting it. If young hero Chu Feng auctions for the Blood Gathering Red Lotus, the auctioneer should quickly conclude the auction so that the others would have a smaller window to bid. At the end of which, I&rsquo;ll be counting on you to personally deliver the items to young hero Chu Feng. Make sure not to retrieve the token I have given to young hero Chu Feng,&rdquo; the elder instructed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo; The woman quickly did as she was told.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the distinguished guest room were all kinds of desserts and a scroll detailing a list of the items up for auction. This was a privilege reserved only for distinguished guests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a quick glance at the scroll, Chu Feng learned that the Blood Gathering Red Lotus was the ultimate treasure of today&rsquo;s auction, followed by a treasure known as the Nine-colored Heavenly Lightning Pearl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Nine-colored Heavenly Lightning Pearl was a treasure useful to those who had inherited the Heavenly Bloodline, and its starting bid was eight hundred sycees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The auction soon began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t interested in the first few items, so he didn&rsquo;t participate at all. However, he noticed that someone in the neighboring distinguished guest room was buying even worthless items at an exorbitant price, seemingly having an obsession with collecting weird items.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng figured that this person might become a potential rival in acquiring the Blood Gathering Red Lotus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the auction started drawing to a close, a pearl crackling with nine-colored lightning was brought out. The pearl was the size of a pill, but it harnessed the power of a Heavenly Bloodline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the pearl was brought out, the auction hall trembled ever so slightly before its tremendous power. A commotion immediately broke out amidst the crowd, as they recognized the value of the Nine-colored Heavenly Lightning Pearl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Chu Feng&rsquo;s opinion, this was the most valuable treasure presented in the auction thus far. There were plenty of cultivators possessing the Heavenly Bloodline, after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Allow me to present to you the Nine-colored Heavenly Lightning Pearl! Back in the Ancient Era, cultivators possessing the Heavenly Bloodline consumed it to enhance their bloodlines, but it has become extremely rare in the present era. This is a fortuitous encounter not to be missed. The starting bid for this item will be 800 sycees. Make sure to bid for it if you&rsquo;re interested!&rdquo; the auctioneer said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng immediately heard the person from the neighboring distinguished guest room declare, &ldquo;A thousand sycees.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;A thousand sycees?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An uproar broke out in the auction hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most bidders would have only raised the bid by ten sycees, but someone actually raised it by two hundred sycees in a single breath. That was worth two hundred Exalted Armaments! Surely there was no need to squander such wealth no matter how rich one was?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;1001 sycees!&rdquo; another elder in the auction hall made his bid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This elder was dressed in a robe embroidered with lightning patterns, hinting that he possessed the Heavenly Bloodline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;1100 sycees,&rdquo; the person in Chu Feng&rsquo;s neighboring distinguished guest room upped the bid right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo; The elder frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He really wanted the Nine-colored Heavenly Lightning Pearl, but the price was getting a bit too much for him to bear. Nevertheless, he gritted his teeth and declared, </span><span>&ldquo;1101 sycees.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;1500 sycees.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elder&rsquo;s face darkened, not expecting the other party to be so loose with his money. He felt indignant, but he had no choice but to settle down and sit out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;As expected of a customer from the distinguished guest room. They are really rich.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd speculated who was inside the distinguished guest room. Those attending this auction were notable figures in this realm, but none of them came close to competing with the person inside the distinguished guest room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the crowd thought that the person was going to win the bid, Chu Feng suddenly spoke up, &ldquo;1600 sycees.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;2000 sycees,&rdquo; the person said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That person sure is arrogant!&rdquo; Eggy was a little displeased by how the other party was bidding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;3000,&rdquo; Chu Feng declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Hoh! Looks like there&rsquo;s a competitor!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng&rsquo;s bid drew the crowd&rsquo;s attention. None of those in the auction hall could see Chu Feng, but that didn&rsquo;t hinder them from speculating about his identity.</span></p></div>
