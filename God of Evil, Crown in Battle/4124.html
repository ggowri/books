        <div> - The Lightning Affliction<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, what&rsquo;s with the look on your face?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me that you don&rsquo;t know about the Divine Lightning Affliction, right?&rdquo; Fumo Shaoyu looked at Chu Feng with shock.<br>&ldquo;I&hellip; really don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Shaoyu, what is this Divine Lightning Affliction you speak of?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a wry smile.<br>He had indeed not heard of the Divine Lightning Affliction before.<br>&ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Did you train in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique or not?&rdquo;<br>Fumo Shaoyu originally thought that Chu Feng was joking with him. However, seeing how serious Chu Feng was, he found himself in disbelief.<br>&ldquo;Whilst it is true that I&rsquo;ve trained in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique, it is also true that I do not know about the Divine Lightning Affliction,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;How could you not know about the Divine Lightning Affliction when you&rsquo;re trained in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that the person who taught you the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique did not inform you?&rdquo; asked Fumo Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not been informed. Brother Shaoyu, I hope you can offer me guidance,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique you&rsquo;ve trained in is incomplete?&rdquo; There was a slight amount of worry in Fumo Shaoyu&rsquo;s eyes as he looked at Chu Feng and sighed.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng shook his head. Soon, he added, &ldquo;I think it should be complete.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng could not be absolutely certain whether or not his Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique was complete. Nevertheless, he felt that it was complete. The reason for that was because he believed in his father and grandfather.<br>Chu Feng believed in the abilities of his father and grandfather.<br>He felt that with their abilities, they should be able to obtain the complete Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.<br>&ldquo;Brother Shaoyu, exactly what is this Divine Lightning Affliction you spoke of?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>He was very curious about that Divine Lightning Affliction.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not particularly knowledgeable of Heavenly Bloodlines myself. These are all things I&rsquo;ve heard from my grandma.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, let me state this first. Everything that I&rsquo;m going to tell you are merely things I&rsquo;ve heard. You cannot blame me if they&rsquo;re inaccurate,&rdquo; said Fumo Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, I will definitely not blame you,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Actually, Divine Lightning Affliction will normally not appear.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that the spring water&rsquo;s lightning and your bloodline are interlinked. That is why a resonance occurred.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If my guess is correct, you must have been attempting a breakthrough earlier,&rdquo; said Fumo Shaoyu as he looked to the lightning spring water.<br>&ldquo;Mn, that is indeed the case. Furthermore&hellip; I nearly lost control.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for brother Shaoyu calling out my name at the right time, I would&rsquo;ve lost control over my reasoning.&rdquo;<br>Although Chu Feng was smiling as he said those words, he was actually filled with helplessness.<br>Ever since his bloodline had awakened, his breakthroughs had always been relatively easy.<br>Basically, as long as he possessed sufficient amounts of natural energies, Chu Feng would be able to make a breakthrough the moment he encountered an opportunity to do so.<br>Very rarely would he encounter the sorts of bottlenecks that ordinary cultivators had, the sort of bottleneck that needed multiple sessions of closed-door training, yet would still fail to make a breakthrough.<br>However, this time around, Chu Feng was experiencing that sort of bottleneck, that sort of pain.<br>If that wasn&rsquo;t the case, he wouldn&rsquo;t have been so anxious, and nearly allowed himself to lose control.<br>&ldquo;There we go. It&rsquo;s because you encountered a Divine Lightning Affliction that you caused the lightning spring water to resonate.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In layman's terms, Divine Lightning Affliction is an obstruction in your martial cultivation path. If you are able to break through it, you&rsquo;ll be able to undergo a metamorphosis.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There are a total of nine levels of Divine Lightning Affliction.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Every one of the nine levels are extremely difficult to overcome.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, one cannot just encounter a Divine Lightning Affliction just because one is trained in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique. In addition to that, there&rsquo;s another essential requirement -- talent.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;At the very least, one must be able to ascend to the Heavenly Lightning Steps&rsquo; ninth step. Only those people will be able to encounter the Divine Lightning Affliction.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The sooner one&rsquo;s Divine Lightning Affliction arrives, the more talented one is.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that even for those who are extremely talented, they will generally only encounter their Divine Lightning Affliction at the Utmost Exalted realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;To be able to encounter a Divine Lightning Affliction at the Exalted realm, you could be said to be a genius among geniuses.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, that talent of yours is truly frightening.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no wonder that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast tried to eat you.&rdquo;<br>Fumo Shaoyu patted Chu Feng&rsquo;s shoulder as he said those words. He was not hiding his admiration toward him in the slightest.<br>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the case. No wonder I&rsquo;ve felt that I&rsquo;ve been unable to make a breakthrough.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;So what is blocking my path is no ordinary barrier to the next level of cultivation, but rather the Divine Lightning Affliction,&rdquo; Chu Feng suddenly became excited.<br>He had long realized that his cultivation being unable to make progress had something to do with his Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.<br>What he did not expect was that what blocked his path had such a grand origin. Furthermore, it seemed like he would gain a lot of benefits should he successfully make a breakthrough.<br>&ldquo;The Divine Lightning Affliction is a good thing. It&rsquo;s not something that just anyone can encounter.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, breaching a Divine Lightning Affliction is no easy task either.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This lightning spring water will be far from enough to help you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You need even more cultivation resources with a relation to Heavenly Bloodline,&rdquo; said Fumo Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t that mean that this lightning spring water will be rendered useless?&rdquo; Chu Feng narrowed his brows. He felt that it was a pity.<br>If he was unable to make a breakthrough in his cultivation, the lightning spring water would really not be of any help to him.<br>But, that lightning spring water was a rare treasure. It would be too much of a pity to waste it like that.<br>If Chu Feng could take it away, even if he couldn&rsquo;t use it himself, it would be of enormous help to his Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, I have a feeling that there&rsquo;s a greater cultivation treasure beneath the spring.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I am unable to confirm its location. Perhaps you should examine our surroundings again?&rdquo; Fumo Shaoyu said to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt surprised upon hearing that.<br>After all, he had examined the ground using his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes.<br>Apart from this lightning spring water, there shouldn&rsquo;t be any other treasures.<br>Could it be that his examination was not thorough enough?<br>That said, since Fumo Shaoyu had mentioned the possibility, Chu feng did not hesitate, and activated his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes and looked down again.<br>Upon doing so, his expression changed enormously.<br>He was shocked to discover that there was actually another treasure located deep underground.<br>It was a lightning pearl, an extremely powerful treasure.<br>It was much more powerful than the lightning spring water.<br>&ldquo;Brother Shaoyu,&rdquo; Chu Feng looked to Fumo Shaoyu. His heart felt extremely complicated.<br>If it was as Fumo Shaoyu had said, and he needed even more powerful cultivation resources in order to overcome the Divine Lightning Affliction, then that lightning pearl had basically been prepared for him .<br>Different from the lightning spring water, the lightning pearl could be taken away.<br>Furthermore, the lightning pearl was most definitely a very valuable item. It could even be said that it was an item that could give rise to a sea of blood as people fought over it.<br>To Heavenly Bloodline possessors, that lightning pearl was most definitely an extremely rare treasure.<br>If it wasn&rsquo;t for Fumo Shaoyu&rsquo;s call to attention, Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t have discovered the lightning pearl at all.<br>As such, the lightning pearl should belong to Fumo Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve found it?&rdquo; Fumo Shaoyu looked at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found it. It&rsquo;s a lightning pearl. It&rsquo;s another treasure for Heavenly Bloodline possessors,&rdquo; Chu Feng said excitedly.<br></p></div>
