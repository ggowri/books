        <div> - Entering The Formation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&lsquo;It would appear that I can finally complete the mission Senior Ox-nose gave me.&rsquo;<br>Chu Feng grew excited upon learning that he was finally able to attempt the spirit formation.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, this spirit formation is something that my master took many years to complete.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is also the spirit formation that my master and Senior Ox-nose bet their reputation and honor on.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You must not be careless. The difficulty of this spirit formation will surpass your imagination. It might even cause you injuries,&rdquo; Yuan Shu spoke with a serious expression.<br>&ldquo;I, Chu Feng, would naturally not dare to be careless against a spirit formation set up by Grandmaster Tang Chen.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since I, Chu Feng, dare to come here, I&rsquo;ve already prepared myself.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng still had a smile on his face. That smile of his was brimming with confidence.<br>&ldquo;As expected of the person chosen by Senior Ox-nose. Brother Chu Feng, I, Yuan Shu, admire your confidence. Follow me.&rdquo;<br>Yuan Shu smiled upon seeing how confident Chu Feng was.<br>He was greatly looking forward to Chu Feng&rsquo;s performance.<br>Even though, if one were to look at things from a different angle, the two of them were competitors, rivals even, and Yuan Shu should be hoping for Chu Feng&rsquo;s failure, he instead seemed more hopeful of his success.<br>Guided by Yuan Shu, Chu Feng arrived at a forbidden area of the Seven Suns Mountain Range.<br>Although it was a forbidden area, it would be more accurate to describe it as a different world.<br>This was a world that Grandmaster Tang Chen had created.<br>Arriving before the spirit formation, Chu Feng was able to tell how extraordinary it was.<br>A giant gate served as the entrance to the spirit formation.<br>That giant gate extended from the surface of the earth all the way into the clouds in the sky.<br>Standing before the gate, Chu Feng felt incomparably small.<br>Inside that enormous spirit formation gate was boundless spirit power. It was like giant waves and enormous whirlpools. The scenery inside was both shocking and terrifying.<br>Apart from the spirit power, the framework of the entrance gate was also meticulously built.<br>Even the decorations and patterns on the framework were extremely unique. They were like pieces of art.<br>Merely by seeing the spirit formation gate, Chu Feng could tell that this was indeed something that Grandmaster Tang Chen had put meticulous effort into.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, take this. If you find yourself stuck, do not try to force your way through. You can withdraw,&rdquo; As Yuan Shu spoke, he handed a talisman paper to Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng understood Yuan Shu&rsquo;s intention. If he wanted to give up, he could activate the talisman paper, and it would send him out of the spirit formation.<br>Yuan Shu&rsquo;s words also revealed to Chu Feng how dangerous the spirit formation was.<br>That said, even if Yuan Shu hadn't told him anything, Chu Feng knew that the spirit formation far surpassed all the spirit formations he had seen before in terms of difficulty.<br>After all, Grandmaster Tang Chen was someone with strength that could very well be described as being a &lsquo;profound mystery.&rsquo;<br>Chu Feng accepted the talisman paper. Although he was very confident, he was not arrogant. He felt that it was better to be safe than sorry, and as such accepted the talisman paper. Besides, Yuan Shu had offered it to him out of kind intentions.<br>&ldquo;Brother Yuan, I&rsquo;ll be entering now,&rdquo; said Chu feng.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, you must not try to act brave and show off,&rdquo; said Yuan Shu.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, I know what to do.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng smiled. Then, he turned around and stepped into the spirit formation.<br>After passing through the entrance gate, Chu Feng arrived in a different world.<br>Mountain ranges and green tree foliage filled his vision, and waterfalls could be seen scattered across the sky.<br>The plants in that world were not special by any regard. Even the birds in the sky were not precious or exotic -- they were merely common birds like cranes and swans.<br>However, such a scene just so happened to be able to bring forth a sense of relaxation. It was as if such a place greatly resembled a world of immortals.<br>After entering that world, the enormous spirit formation gate disappeared.<br>Chu Feng finally understood why Yuan Shu had given him that talisman paper.<br>It turned out that once he passed through the enormous entrance, breaching the spirit formation and the talisman paper were the only ways out.<br>Although the world inside the spirit formation was intoxicatingly beautiful and akin to a land of immortals, Chu Feng did not sense the slightest bit of danger.<br>Even when he used his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes to examine the situation, he was unable to find any clues. It was as if that would was purely a magnificently beautiful world without anything special.<br>&ldquo;How am I supposed to breach this spirit formation?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t possibly have to go on a scenic tour, right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Or could it be that I need to find the method to leave this place on my own?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s brows furrowed slightly. He felt completely baffled. He didn&rsquo;t understand how exactly he was supposed to breach the spirit formation.<br>That said, he did not look for the exit blindly. He instead began to think carefully.<br>At the same time as Chu Feng was thinking, Yuan Shu was still outside the spirit formation entrance.<br>He was unable to see the situation inside the spirit formation and could only wait outside.<br>He was pacing back and forth. He appeared to be impatient and restless.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the space beside him started trembling. Seeing the distorted space, Yuan Shu revealed a look of joy.<br>Soon, a figure stepped out of the distorted space. That person was Yuan Shu&rsquo;s master, Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;Master, didn&rsquo;t you say that weren't coming?&rdquo;<br>Yuan Shu greeted his master with a grin and spoke with a slightly teasing tone.<br>&ldquo;That kid is challenging the spirit formation that this old man meticulously has set up, how could this old man not come?&rdquo; said Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;Master, in that case, why didn&rsquo;t you show up directly? Why did you have me lie to brother Chu Feng and say that you&rsquo;re not here?&rdquo; asked Yuan Shu.<br>&ldquo;Who is he? He&rsquo;s Ox-nose&rsquo;s disciple.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ox-nose didn&rsquo;t come here. If I am to show myself, wouldn&rsquo;t I be lowering my own status?&rdquo; Grandmaster Tang Chen said with his lip curled.<br>&ldquo;Master, you, this&hellip;&rdquo; Hearing those words, Yuan Shu didn&rsquo;t know whether to laugh or cry.<br>&ldquo;Master, how are things looking inside the spirit formation?&rdquo; asked Yuan Shu.<br>Although Yuan Shu was unable to see the situation inside the spirit formation, he knew that his master could.<br>After all, that grand formation had been set up by his master.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s there to be so anxious about? Things haven&rsquo;t even begun yet,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;When will it start?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, exactly what is master&rsquo;s grand formation like?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Master, shouldn&rsquo;t you let me have a look too?&rdquo; Yuan Shu asked with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;You truly want to look that much?&rdquo; asked Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;I do, I do. Of course I want to look.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say that the difficulty of your spirit formation had nothing to do with one&rsquo;s level of world spirit techniques, that White-cloak World Spiritists could breach it and Saint-cloak World Spiritists could also breach it, that its difficulty is equal to any world spiritist?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, spirit formations possess different levels of intensity on their own. Exactly what sort of spirit formation will be able to treat all things equally?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I am truly curious as to what sort of spirit formation this is.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, this spirit formation is something that master has meticulously set up. I truly want to see exactly what sort of spirit formation could make my master spend so many years and so much effort to set up,&rdquo; said Yuan Shu.<br>&ldquo;This spirit formation is indeed special. When that old codger Ox-nose and I made our arrangement, we&rsquo;d agreed on our spirit formations to test a world spiritist&rsquo;s talent.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, breaching the spirit formation relies not on the strength of the world spiritist&rsquo;s spirit power, but rather on their talent. Only by having sufficient talent and exceptional perception can one succeed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Regardless, this is indeed not an ordinary spirit formation,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the case, why didn&rsquo;t you allow brother Chu Feng to attempt to breach this formation earlier, but agreed to allow him to do so now?&rdquo; asked Yuan Shu.<br>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How old are you now?&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen answered Yuan Shu&rsquo;s question with another question.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m five hundred and seven years old,&rdquo; said Yuan Shu.<br>&ldquo;Then when did you become a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist?&rdquo; asked Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;Over a hundred years ago. At that time, I was four hundred and three years old,&rdquo; Yuan Shu immediately asked after answering his master, &ldquo;Master, why did you suddenly ask me that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Humph, useless thing,&rdquo; Grandmaster Tang Chen rolled his eyes at Yuan Shu.<br>&ldquo;Master, why did you suddenly start cursing me out again?&rdquo;<br>Yuan Chu felt both confused and wronged by his master.<br></p></div>
