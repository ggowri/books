        <h1>Chapter 5286</h1>
        <div>: Elite Token<br>But Long Chengzhou and Ningyu Shangren weren&rsquo;t the only ones following Chu Feng. Two other people were secretly tagging along in the shadows too.<br>Upon arriving at a remote location, Chu Feng turned around and said, &ldquo;Come out.&rdquo;<br>His eyes were locked on the concealed Liang Feng&rsquo;s master.<br>Liang Feng&rsquo;s master revealed himself, but he couldn&rsquo;t help but ask in astonishment, &ldquo;You noticed me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why else did you think I&rsquo;d suddenly come here?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;You lured me here?&rdquo; Liang Feng&rsquo;s master was even more astounded.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng laughed. &ldquo;I know why you&rsquo;re here. I am the one who killed your disciple, but it&rsquo;s your disciple who provoked me first. I don&rsquo;t care whether he was used by others or not, but he has it coming for pushing his luck. I&rsquo;m explaining things to you not to say that I&rsquo;m in the right. Rather, I&rsquo;m warning you that you&rsquo;ll be next if you dare to challenge me too.<br>&ldquo;What an arrogant brat! Do you think that I&rsquo;d fall for your scare? I don&rsquo;t care why you killed my disciple, but you have to pay the price for it! Anyone who dares to touch my disciple must die!&rdquo;<br>Liang Feng&rsquo;s master whipped out an Exalted Armament saber and hacked it down upon Chu Feng. It appeared to be an ordinary attack, but tremendous might was packed in it. It was an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill.<br>However, Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t fazed in the least. A surge of spirit power flowed out and easily blocked the attack from the Exalted Taboo Martial Skill.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a White Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist? Aren&rsquo;t you a junior?&rdquo; Liang Feng&rsquo;s master asked.<br>&ldquo;Who told you that juniors can&rsquo;t reach White Dragon God-cloak?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even White Dragon God-cloak World Spiritists wouldn&rsquo;t be able to block my attacks. You&rsquo;re carrying a treasure?&rdquo; Liang Feng&rsquo;s master asked.<br>He was at rank two Half-God, whereas White Dragon God-cloak World Spiritists were only comparable to rank one Half-God cultivators. It shouldn&rsquo;t have been possible for Chu Feng to block his attack.<br>&ldquo;With a master like you, it&rsquo;s no wonder your disciple was so dumb. You can&rsquo;t even tell the difference between a treasure and spirit power? It&rsquo;s no wonder you aren&rsquo;t able to advance beyond rank two Half-God level,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Tough talk from someone who&rsquo;s about to die! Even treasures won&rsquo;t be able to save you!&rdquo;<br>Provoked by those words, Liang Feng&rsquo;s master raised his saber up high to execute an even stronger Exalted Taboo Martial Skill.<br>Weng!<br>A spirit formation gate suddenly appeared in front of him. Liang Feng&rsquo;s master was startled.<br>Pu!<br>While Liang Feng&rsquo;s master was still trying to figure out what was going on, a spear whizzed out from the spirit formation gate and impaled his chest. Chu Feng then walked out from the spirit formation gate, holding the other end of the spear.<br>Killing intent flared in Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes.<br>Having never faced such terrifying killing intent before, Liang Feng&rsquo;s master was intimidated. He fell to his knees and cried, &ldquo;D-don&rsquo;t kill me! I&rsquo;ll do whatever you want as long as you spare me!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t respond. Instead, he flicked his hand and tossed a pill into Liang Feng&rsquo;s master&rsquo;s mouth.<br>Liang Feng&rsquo;s master immediately tried to spit out the pill, only to realize that he couldn&rsquo;t move his body. Chu Feng had injected his spirit power into his body via the spear to immobilize him.<br>This was one of the strengths that spirit power had over martial power&mdash;it was far more malleable than martial power.<br>Liang Feng&rsquo;s master could only watch helplessly as a poison spread in his body.<br>&ldquo;Please give me a chance. I was foolish. I allowed my anger to take hold of me. To tell you the truth, Liang Feng is my real son. Otherwise, I wouldn&rsquo;t have stood up for him either,&rdquo; Liang Feng&rsquo;s master cried.<br>&ldquo;Foolish?&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered.<br>He knew that Liang Feng&rsquo;s master was regretting his actions because he was in a disadvantageous position, so he didn&rsquo;t pity the latter in the least. However, he chose not to kill the other party right away.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll offer you some words of advice. I was the one who killed Liang Feng, but I wasn&rsquo;t the mastermind behind it. I&rsquo;m not the one you should be exacting vengeance on. Do you get what I&rsquo;m saying?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Y-yes! I understand!&rdquo; Liang Feng&rsquo;s master nodded vehemently.<br>&ldquo;That better be the case.&rdquo; Chu Feng retracted his spear before taking his leave.<br>Liang Feng&rsquo;s master quickly swallowed a few antidote pills before sitting on the ground. He was trying to remove the poison inside him.<br>&ldquo;That useless thing!&rdquo;<br>Up in the sky, the hidden Mo Chengzhou slapped his thigh in anger. The failure of Liang Feng&rsquo;s master had botched his plan to play the hero before Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Why are you getting angry? Isn&rsquo;t this something to rejoice over?&rdquo; Ningyu Shangren asked.<br>&ldquo;What is there to rejoice when my plan has gone down the drain?&rdquo; Mo Chengzhou replied.<br>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Chu Feng&rsquo;s prowess as a world spiritist something worth rejoicing over? Other than those few from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, I doubt that there&rsquo;s anyone who is able to match him,&rdquo; Ningyu Shangren said.<br>Mo Chengzhou&rsquo;s complexion improved upon hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;Indeed. Considering how powerful his spirit power is, it&rsquo;s likely that he has an incredible world spiritist bloodline. I was already impressed by his incredible talent as a cultivator, but who could have thought that his true strength lies in his spirit power? Now that you say that&hellip;&rdquo;<br>A gleam flashed across Mo Chengzhou&rsquo;s eyes as he realized something. Words lingered at the tip of his tongue, but he chose not to voice them aloud. However, Ningyu Shangren sensed his intention, and her eyes turned sharp.<br>&ldquo;You should know that I have high expectations of Chu Feng too. I&rsquo;m only giving you priority because you risked your life to check if he had any backing. Remember this, Chu Feng is the future husband of our Xiaoxiao. I don&rsquo;t have any qualms if you earnestly intend to nurture his talents, but I won&rsquo;t stand still if you&rsquo;re going to exploit him to save your son,&rdquo; Ningyu Shangren said.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way I would do that. How could I possibly let such talent go to waste? Who knows? He might even become the husband of our Yuhan,&rdquo; Mo Chengzhou replied with a smile.<br>&hellip;<br>Meanwhile, Chu Feng had already returned to the entrance of the Trial of the Strongest.<br>The challengers had started returning from the trial via spirit formation gates. The crowd was still shaken by the earlier incident with the demon monk, but the return of the challengers pulled their attention back to the Trial of the Strongest.<br>Chu Feng soon caught sight of Long Xiaoxiao. The latter also noticed him and quickly rushed over.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I had a fortuitous encounter. I passed out because I obtained an incredible power&mdash;no, it would be more accurate to call it dao law. It&rsquo;s a type of martial enlightenment. In any case, it&rsquo;s incredibly powerful!&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao told him via voice transmission.<br>She had been wanting to tell Chu Feng about it, but Liu Kuo kept talking to her after she regained consciousness. Before she could find an opportunity to tell him, she was suddenly sent back to the tower.<br>&ldquo;I know. I obtained it too,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied via voice transmission.<br>&ldquo;You obtained it too?&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao was surprised. She thought that she was the only one who received it.<br>&ldquo;How many dao laws did you receive?&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao asked.<br>&ldquo;Nine,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied honestly.<br>&ldquo;Ah?!&rdquo;<br>Long Xiaoxiao froze up. She was shocked by what she had just heard. She had to strain herself just to receive a single dao law, but Chu Feng actually took in nine of them? How strong must his willpower be?<br>&ldquo;Hoh! Isn&rsquo;t that Chu Feng? How are you doing? You must have been scared by the demon monk&rsquo;s attack!&rdquo; a voice suddenly echoed.<br>Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s seniors, Zhao Yunmo and Cheng Tianchan, walked up to them.<br>After the incident with Liang Feng, the two of them knew that there was no point in continuing their act, so they began showing their true face to Chu Feng.<br>At the same point, a huge bunch of juniors began gathering around them. They were the ones who were present in the gathering back at the mountain peak. None of them dared to look down on Chu Feng anymore, but they still chose to gather around to watch the commotion.<br>They knew that Zhao Yunmo and Cheng Tianchan must be up to something.<br>&ldquo;Junior, how was your result?&rdquo; Cheng Tianchan asked concernedly.<br>&ldquo;So-so,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao coldly replied.<br>&ldquo;Junior, you&rsquo;re ultimately limited by your own cultivation. Our master only told us to bring you along to expand your horizon. You need not be too bothered by the results. It&rsquo;s just that Brother Chu Feng&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Cheng Tianchan turned to Chu Feng before continuing his speech. &ldquo;Haa. You shouldn&rsquo;t be too bothered by the results too. It can&rsquo;t be helped since you&rsquo;re from the Holy Light Galaxy. There&rsquo;s only so much you can do. The important thing is that you have participated in the trial. That&rsquo;ll be something for you to boast about for many years to come.&rdquo;<br>Following that, both Zhao Yunmo and Cheng Tianchan began laughing in disdain.<br>Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s eyes reddened in anger. She was just about to say something when someone else beat her to it.<br>&ldquo;What are your results then?&rdquo;<br>The crowd turned their eyes over, only to be shocked to discover that it was Mo Yuhan. Those who were acquainted with her knew that she was a reticent individual who kept her distance from others. It was rare for her to join the commotion.<br>Cheng Tianchan had no idea why Mo Yuhan was talking to him, but he was delighted by it. He straightened out his clothes and said, &ldquo;Miss Mo, there were simply too many prodigies in the tournament. I have only managed to obtain an Elite Token.&rdquo;<br>Cheng Tianchan began flashing his Elite Token around. Despite his humble words, his proud attitude told a different story.<br>&ldquo;Cough cough! Just like my senior, I only obtained an Elite Token.&rdquo;<br>Zhao Yunmo also began proudly parading his Elite Token around.<br></div>
