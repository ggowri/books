        <div> - Chu Feng&rsquo;s Challenge<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>After being captured by Chu Feng, one of the men said, &ldquo;Bastard, release us! If you don&rsquo;t, you will wish you were dead!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You actually dare to even threaten me in your current situation. Do you believe that I won&rsquo;t make it so that you all wished you were dead now?&rdquo; As Chu Feng said those words, a section of the world spirit chain that had bound that man turned into a sharp blade. &ldquo;Puuu,&rdquo; it pierced into that man&rsquo;s body.<br>That was not an ordinary sharp blade. Instead, it was a sharp blade formed by a spirit formation. The pain from the blade piercing through one&rsquo;s body was over a hundred times that of an ordinary blade.<br>&ldquo;Ahhh~ Don&rsquo;t! Don&rsquo;t kill me!&rdquo; With the blade pierced into his body, the man&rsquo;s facial expression became distorted. He was crying with tears and snot. He had begun to hurriedly beg for forgiveness.<br>However, Chu Feng ignored his begging. With how he shouted, it was clear that this man had never experienced pain like this before. His endurance was extremely weak. In merely a short moment, he lost consciousness.<br>&ldquo;Spare us, please spare us.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that, the remaining four people immediately started to beg for forgiveness. They deeply feared that they would suffer the same sort of torment as that man.<br>At this moment, Chu Feng came to realize what sort of people the Poison Demon&rsquo;s descendants were. It turned out that these Poison Demon&rsquo;s descendants were nothing more than paper tigers. They possessed absolutely zero integrity.<br>&ldquo;While I am able to spare your lives, you must answer some of my questions. Among you all, whose cultivation is the strongest?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Lord Clan Chief,&rdquo; The four people answered in the same manner.<br>&ldquo;What is the name of your Clan Chief and what is his cultivation?&rdquo; Chu Feng continued to ask.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief&rsquo;s name is Du Wanwu. He is a rank four Half Martial Emperor,&rdquo; One of the men said.<br>&ldquo;How strong is your Clan Chief&rsquo;s battle power? How many levels of cultivation is he capable of surmounting?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Levels of cultivation he is capable of surmounting? What do you mean by that? We don&rsquo;t understand. Regardless of who it is, those with the same cultivation are unable to defeat Lord Clan Chief,&rdquo; they answered.<br>Chu Feng had been observing the reactions of the five people. They had replied extremely quickly and without the slightest hesitation. Furthermore, they had all given the same sort of answer. It could be seen that they were not lying.<br>Chu Feng considered matters carefully. As Du Wanwu was a rank four Half Martial Emperor, Chu Feng, with his current abilities, would be able to fight against him.<br>After all, even the top geniuses in the Holy Land of Martialism would only possess heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation. With Chu Feng&rsquo;s heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation, he would be able to make up for the gap in cultivation between him and Du Wanwu.<br>However, there was one more thing that he had to consider. Du Wanwu was a Divine Body. The power of Divine Bodies was something that he could not underestimate.<br>The way Chu Feng saw it, Divine Bodies were a power stronger than Imperial Bloodlines. The reason why many Divine Bodies were not very powerful was because they themselves were unable to completely grasp their powers.<br>If they were able to completely grasp their Divine Bodies&rsquo; powers, they would be extremely powerful. One such example would be Yan Xie. As a Half Martial Emperor, he was able to, through his Divine Body&rsquo;s power, increase his cultivation by one level.<br>If this Du Wanwu was truly a top genius, he would likely possess Divine Power on par with Yan Xie. If that were to be the case, Chu Feng would likely not be a match for him.<br>Thinking of it, Chu Feng took out his two Incomplete Imperial Armaments, the Cyan Rainbow Sword and the Purple Rainbow sword, and began to carefully inspect them.<br>Chu Feng had already placed two spirit formations on the two swords. Those two spirit formations would be able to sever the connection the swords had with Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi through the passage of time.<br>As long as the connections were severed, Chu Feng would be able to subdue the two Incomplete Imperial Armaments with his own power and make them be of use to him.<br>Furthermore, if he were able to have the two of them enter absolute submission, he would be able to obtain a portion of their power. The power he would obtain would also be able to fill his dantian and potentially increase his cultivation.<br>Chu Feng had calculated the power of these two Incomplete Imperial Armaments and compared them to the power he had obtained when his Demon Sealing Sword had entered absolute submission.<br>Through that, Chu Feng calculated whether he would be able to reach a breakthrough should the two Incomplete Imperial Armaments really enter absolute submission toward him.<br>Unfortunately, after calculating, with the requirement that his dantian currently possessed, even if these two Incomplete Imperial Armaments were to enter absolute submission, he would still not be able to reach a breakthrough.<br>It was not that the Cyan Rainbow Sword and the Purple Rainbow Sword possessed insufficient power. Instead, their powers were very strong, stronger than ordinary Incomplete Imperial Armaments.<br>Merely, the appetite Chu Feng&rsquo;s Divine Lightnings possessed had become more and more enormous. Things were completely different now. Even if the Cyan Rainbow Sword and the Purple Rainbow Sword were to enter absolute submission, Chu Feng would not be able to break through.<br>Moreover, after the Cyan Rainbow Sword and the Purple Rainbow Sword were unsealed, Chu Feng was also not absolutely certain that he would be able to make the two of them enter absolute submission and serve him.<br>After all, they were actual Incomplete Imperial Armaments, and not copies. It would have been very good already if they were to acknowledge Chu Feng as their master.<br>After all, Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi were unable to even make them acknowledge them. They were only able to use these two Incomplete Imperial Armaments with the help of a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist.<br>Thus, Chu Feng had no ways of increasing his cultivation here.<br>Even though Chu Feng was not fond of fighting battles that he had no certainty of winning, he also knew the meaning of seeking fortune amidst dangers. As matters stood, he had no choice but to choose the latter.<br>Thus, after Chu Feng helped heal the injuries Goudan&rsquo;er&rsquo;s father and the others sustained, he brought the five Poison Demon&rsquo;s descendants and proceeded toward the place where they resided. Chu Feng wanted to meet that Du Wanwu who had become their Clan Chief at such a young age.<br>In truth, Chu Feng&rsquo;s main purpose was to obtain the Fire Immortal Profound Technique and find out whether there might be any way for him to leave this place without taking on additional risks.<br>After arriving at the Poison Demon&rsquo;s descendants&rsquo; residence, Chu Feng discovered that this was a very fascinating place.<br>They had not constructed palaces. Instead, they were actually living in a cave. However, this cave was naturally no ordinary cave. It was very large and possessed over a dozen gates of entry. Among them, the tallest gate was over a hundred meters tall, and the shortest gate was over thirty meters tall.<br>In order to create this enormous cave, they had likely excavated the entire mountain.<br>There was currently no one guarding the entrances of the cave. Likely, due to the fact that they had ruled over this place for so long, the villagers simply did not dare to come here. Thus, they were confident that there would not be any trouble or need for guards.<br>Chu Feng had the five Poison Demon&rsquo;s descendants stand in a row and kneel before him. Then, he placed his hands behind his back and loudly shouted, &ldquo;The Poison Demon&rsquo;s descendants are without morals and virtue. They bully and humiliate commoners. As such, they shall be beheaded.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;All of you, scram out here. Allow me to properly teach you all how to conduct yourselves.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Who is the reckless individual who dares to come here and display such atrocious behavior?!&rdquo;<br>The Poison Demon&rsquo;s descendants had never been insulted by others before. After hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s insults, several hundred people&rsquo;s shouts were instantly heard. There were even a portion among them that were young people and even children. Likely, they had thought that a villager had come to court death. Thus, they all came to enjoy the show.<br>Therefore, when they saw Chu Feng, they were all shocked. The reason for that was because, no matter how hard they looked at Chu Feng, he did not resemble the villagers.<br>One of the Poison Demon&rsquo;s descendants with a relatively high level of cultivation, a rank nine Martial King, pointed at Chu Feng and asked, &ldquo;Who are you?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;A bunch of trash is not qualified to speak with me. Go and call out your clan chief,&rdquo; Chu Feng lightly waved his sleeve and caused a gale to suddenly surge forth. Other than the children, all of the Poison Demon&rsquo;s descendants before him were blown away by the gale like fallen leaves. In the end, they all crashed onto the ground miserably.<br>&ldquo;Quickly, call Lord Clan Chief. This man has passed through the Poison Fog Formation. He&rsquo;s from the Holy Land of Martialism. We are no match for him,&rdquo; The five people who first encountered Chu Feng shouted in unison.<br>&ldquo;What?! The Holy Land of Martialism?!&rdquo; Hearing those words, the Poison Demon&rsquo;s descendants were all shocked. Regardless of whether they might be old or young, they all began to flee into the cave.<br>Evidently, the name &lsquo;Holy Land of Martialism&rsquo; brought great fear upon them. As Chu Feng was someone from the Holy Land of Martialism, he was also extremely frightening to them.<br></p></div>
