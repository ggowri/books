        <h1>Chapter 3927</h1>
        <div> - Vicious And Merciless<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Thank you for your advice, sister.&rdquo;<br>Even though the nun seemed to look down on Chu Feng, she'd still provided him with valuable information. Thus, Chu Feng not only did not bicker with her, but he instead responded to her very politely.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been six hours already, are you unable to even handle such minor things?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;A single day goes by without beating you and you forget about your lesson already.&rdquo;<br>At the moment when Chu Feng was planning to leave, a loud scolding sounded from deep within the Whiteclothes Nunnery.<br>&ldquo;Almsgiver, if you don&rsquo;t need anything else, you should leave quickly.&rdquo;<br>Hearing the scolding, the expression of the nun before Chu Feng suddenly changed. Furthermore, after she finished saying those words to him, before he could even respond, she immediately shut the door in Chu Feng&rsquo;s face with a loud bang.<br>After shutting the door, that nun immediately began to rush inward.<br>&ldquo;Sure enough, places with people will always have disputes. There&rsquo;s no such thing as a pure land in this world.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng sighed. He had no intention to meddle in other people&rsquo;s business. He merely sighed at the fact that the Whiteclothes Nunnery, a nunnery of all places, would also have disputes.<br>That said, the scolding did not stop. Instead, it became even more intense. With that, the sound of someone begging for forgiveness could be heard too.<br>&ldquo;Senior sister, I was wrong, I was wrong. Please stop hitting me. I will definitely be faster next time.&rdquo;<br>Hearing the voice begging for forgiveness, Chu Feng, who had already turned around and was walking on the path down the mountain, suddenly stopped.<br>The reason for that was because that voice sounded familiar to him.<br>&ldquo;I must be overthinking things. How could I find an acquaintance at a place like this?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng shook his head and continued on his way.<br>&ldquo;Senior sister, please stop hitting me. I really know I was wrong.&rdquo;<br>That voice sounded from deep within the Whiteclothes Nunnery. Normally, a passer-by would not be able to hear it.<br>Merely, as Chu Feng had extended his spirit power, all aspects of his perception had grown much sharper. Thus, he was able to hear that person being beaten up more and more, and begging for forgiveness with a voice filled with more and more grief.<br>Although Chu Feng was not fond of meddling in other people's business, he was also not a cold-hearted person.<br>Hearing the voice begging for forgiveness repeatedly, Chu Feng was already slightly moved. Besides, the voice sounded a bit familiar.<br>Thus, Chu Feng halted his footsteps and turned around to check things out.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze changed. Then, the walls and the gates before him all disappeared from his field of vision.<br>Soon, Chu Feng locked onto the location where the begging sounds were coming from.<br>There were two nuns surrounding a little nun and beating her up.<br>Soon, another nun ran over and joined the bunch of nuns beating up that little nun.<br>The nun who had rushed over was none other than the nun who had received Chu Feng earlier.<br>&ldquo;You shameless little shit, you&rsquo;re truly courting death!&rdquo;<br>That nun had only just rushed over. She clearly didn&rsquo;t even know what had happened. Yet, she immediately began beating that little nun. Not only that, but she was also insulting her.<br>Chu Feng had already guessed that the nun who had received him earlier was not some good and virtuous person. Her current actions had verified his guess.<br>However, Chu Feng was not interested in all those things. The reason for that was because his gaze was currently focused on the little nun who was receiving a beating.<br>Chu Feng knew that little nun. She belonged to the Linghu Heavenly Clan. She was the daughter of the Linghu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Linghu Yueyue.<br>&ldquo;What is she doing here?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt surprised to see Linghu Yueyue.<br>After all, he had personally beheaded the Linghu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and many experts several days ago.<br>At that time, Chu Feng did not see Linghu Yueyue. That said, he did not bother to search for her either. After all, there was no friendship between them.<br>Back then, Chu Feng had only felt the Linghu Heavenly Clan to be devoid of conscience, as they were willing to willfully slaughter the innocent for the sake of completing their task. Because of that, he had felt that all of them should be killed.<br>Chu Feng had originally thought Linghu Yueyue to be among the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen he killed. He'd never expected to see her here.<br>It seemed that she hadn&rsquo;t been there that day.<br>Who was Linghu Yueyue?<br>Linghu Yueyue was not only Linghu Zhishi&rsquo;s daughter, but she herself was also a genius cultivator. Among the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen, she was the person of the younger generation second to only Linghu Hongfei.<br>Furthermore, Linghu Yueyue had a condescending nature, where she considered everyone else to be beneath her.<br>Thus, why would she be beaten up by a bunch of nuns today?<br>Furthermore, those were a bunch of nuns with cultivations that were only at Heavenly Immortal realm.<br>&ldquo;Wait, something&rsquo;s amiss.&rdquo;<br>Soon, Chu Feng noticed what was wrong.<br>In Chu Feng&rsquo;s memory, Linghu Yueyue&rsquo;s cultivation should be that of a rank seven Martial Immortal.<br>However, Linghu Yueyue&rsquo;s current cultivation was&hellip; only that of a rank one Heavenly Immortal. Furthermore, her cultivation was very unstable on top of that.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng used his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes to carefully observe Linghu Yueyue. Soon, he realized the truth.<br>Linghu Yueyue&rsquo;s dantian had been seriously injured. Her cultivation had been crippled.<br>But, who did that?<br>No matter what, Linghu Zhishi was a rank two Utmost Exalted. Even in the Reincarnation Upper Realm, he would be considered to be a top expert. With him protecting Linghu Yueyue, there shouldn&rsquo;t be anyone capable of causing her harm.<br>That said, a very important consideration was that Linghu Yueyue was not with the Linghu Heavenly Clan.<br>Why did she decide to leave her father and clansmen?<br>Chu Feng was confused about a lot of things.<br>&ldquo;I was wrong. I was truly wrong.&rdquo;<br>Linghu Yueyue was kneeling on the ground and begging the nuns for forgiveness.<br>However, those nuns showed no intention of stopping.<br>Those nuns were actually not trying to kill her. They were only trying to teach her a lesson.<br>That said, although the nuns did not intend to kill, it remained that their cultivations were higher than Linghu Yueyue&rsquo;s. Thus, even though they were not going all-out, their casual beatings still managed to quickly leave a vast stretch of bruises on Linghuu Yueyue. Even her delicate little face was unable to escape from the bruises.<br>Although Chu Feng had a deep hatred for the Linghu Heavenly Clan, his hatred was not aimed at any individual Linghu Heavenly Clansman.<br>Between him and Linghu Yueyue, there were no grudges to be found&hellip;<br>Although Linghu Yueyue was very arrogant and slightly tyrannical, she seemed to have not done anything excessive.<br>Perhaps because Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t feel any antipathy for Linghu Yueyue, or perhaps because he was feeling some guilt for killing her father and clansmen, Chu Feng ended up feeling compassion for Linghu Yueyue after seeing what she was going through.<br>To help her or not?<br>Chu Feng was hesitant.<br>&ldquo;Forget it. I&rsquo;ll help her this once. After all, she won&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s me.&rdquo;<br>Coming to this decision, Chu Feng flew forward past the layers of high walls to directly reach the courtyard, and landed outside the entrance to the palace hall.<br>&ldquo;Sisters, to bully a person of the younger generation in broad daylight, if such a thing is to be known to others, I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;ll bring shame on you, no?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng spoke sternly after landing.<br>Hearing someone speaking about them, those nuns immediately felt guilty and stopped beating Linghu Yueyue.<br>However, when they saw Chu Feng, they were bewildered. They asked, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s that passerby who knocked on the entrance earlier.&rdquo;<br>The nuns that had been beating up Linghu Yueyue spoke eccentrically.<br>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s him.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the nuns revealed cold smiles on their faces.<br>&ldquo;Almsgiver, you truly shouldn&rsquo;t meddle in other people&rsquo;s business.&rdquo;<br>The nun who had received Chu Feng earlier also revealed a cold smile. Most importantly, Chu Feng felt killing intent from her.<br>She actually wanted to kill Chu Feng just because he had meddled in their business?<br>No, it&rsquo;s wasn't that simple. Chu Feng had personally witnessed their bad behavior.<br>They likely didn&rsquo;t want Chu Feng to spread news about the matter, as it would affect their reputation.<br>Thus, these nuns had decided to kill Chu Feng to silence him.<br>However, to kill others to silence them for merely that, one could tell how vicious and merciless those nuns were.<br>&ldquo;Sister, allow me to offer you a word of advice. It would be best for you to not attack me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Otherwise, you will end up regretting it,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br></p></div>
