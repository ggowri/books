        <h1>Chapter 5263</h1>
        <div>: I Don&rsquo;t Dare, I&rsquo;m Afraid of Death<br>&ldquo;My gosh&hellip; How did you grow that quickly? With your current level of strength, there won&rsquo;t be too many juniors in the Totem Galaxy who can match you. Haaa, it looks like I&rsquo;ll never be able to catch up with you.&rdquo;<br>Long Xiaoxiao was smiling despite her lamenting words. She was happy for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t bad yourself. I sense that you&rsquo;re hiding your true strength&hellip; Am I right?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Well&hellip; I&rsquo;m not exactly hiding it,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao replied with a beaming smile.<br>It turned out that Long Xiaoxiao had gained a deeper understanding of her bloodline thanks to her master&rsquo;s help. If she used the power of the dragon horns, she could raise her cultivation by three ranks in a single breath, all the way to rank four Martial Exalted level.<br>Most important of all, she could already make a breakthrough to rank two Martial Exalted level, but she was suppressing her cultivation. Her master had told her to hold it in for a while before making a breakthrough, saying that it would be beneficial to her in the future.<br>In any case, it was possible for her to reach rank two Martial Exalted level before the Trial of the Strongest. By then, she would be on par with rank five Martial Exalted level cultivators. The only question was whether her master would allow her to reveal the power of the dragon horns.<br>Either way, she wasn&rsquo;t too bothered about it. She was already satisfied being able to watch the Trial of the Strongest and broaden her horizons.<br>Meanwhile, the gathering ended shortly after Chu Feng and Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s departure.<br>Cheng Tianchan and Zhao Yunmo gathered together in a palace to discuss their next move.<br>&ldquo;First Senior, what do we do now?&rdquo; Zhao Yunmo asked worriedly.<br>He had only wanted to teach Chu Feng a lesson, but he didn&rsquo;t expect to meet with such an outcome. Liang Feng&rsquo;s death was already troublesome as it was, but Long Xiaoxiao was bound to blame them for this matter too.<br>&ldquo;What are you afraid of? Our junior can&rsquo;t leave our master&rsquo;s side yet. We&rsquo;ll be with her for the years to come, so it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before her anger subsides. As for Liang Feng&rsquo;s death, Chu Feng doesn&rsquo;t have any evidence of our involvement in this matter. Do you think that Liang Feng&rsquo;s master will trust us or the man who killed his disciple?&rdquo; Cheng Tianchan asked.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re saying that we should just feign ignorance and go with the flow?&rdquo; Zhao Yunmo asked.<br>&ldquo;Liang Feng&rsquo;s junior has already relayed the news to their master, but it&rsquo;ll take some time for their master to arrive. The Trial of the Strongest is likely to be over by then. However, this also means that Chu Feng won&rsquo;t be able to continue bothering our junior unless he wants to expose himself. There&rsquo;s no way Liang Feng&rsquo;s master would let him off once he finds him,&rdquo; Cheng Tianchan said.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, First Senior. That means that Chu Feng only has two options&mdash;stay as far away from our junior as possible or die,&rdquo; Zhao Yunmo said.<br>&ldquo;What would you choose if you were in his position?&rdquo; Cheng Tianchan asked.<br>&ldquo;Survival, of course. That is more important than anything,&rdquo; Zhao Yunmo replied.<br>&ldquo;Indeed. Anyone with a functional brain wouldn&rsquo;t die over a woman. Even though he might look all arrogant now, he&rsquo;ll be living the life of a timid rat very soon. He won&rsquo;t dare to appear in front of our junior ever again,&rdquo; Cheng Tianchan sneered.<br>Zhao Yunmo smiled in relief. He was glad that Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t be getting away scot-free after publicly embarrassing them.<br>&hellip;<br>There were two figures on the distant horizon, an old man and an old woman.<br>The old man&rsquo;s hair was messy, and he was dressed casually too. A slight stench could be smelled on him. Most people would have mistaken him for a beggar. Yet, the wine gourd he carried on his waist remained sparkling clean on him.<br>The old woman had a wrinkly face, but she looked prim and proper. Her silver hair was put in place, with not a single strand falling out of position.<br>&ldquo;That lad from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy is incredible. He&rsquo;s already reached God-cloak despite his young age, and his fighting prowess is formidable too. He&rsquo;ll probably raise an uproar in the vast world of cultivation very soon,&rdquo; the old man said.<br>Chu Feng had set up an isolation formation inside his palace, but it wasn&rsquo;t enough to block off the old man&rsquo;s gaze. Both the old man and the old woman had heard whatever Chu Feng and Long Xiaoxiao said between them loud and clear.<br>Nothing in their direct surroundings could escape their senses. After all, they were one of the top experts of the Totem Galaxy.<br>The old man was Mo Yuhan&rsquo;s grandfather, Mo Chengzhou.<br>The old woman was Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s master, Ningyu Shangren.<br>While they weren&rsquo;t typically considered to be amongst the strongest in the Totem Galaxy, that was only because outsiders were unaware of their true strength. Only the two of them knew exactly how strong each other was.<br>&ldquo;Xiaoxiao has praised Chu Feng many times before. I thought that she was only making a big fuss because she has never ventured beyond the Ancestral Martial Galaxy before. After all, how formidable could a junior from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy be? However, it seems like she isn&rsquo;t exaggerating at all.&rdquo; Ningyu Shangren could hardly conceal her astonishment when she looked at Chu Feng despite her worldly experience.<br>&ldquo;How do you think Chu Feng compares to Long Chengyu and Xianhai Shaoyu?&rdquo; Mo Yuhan&rsquo;s grandfather asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s hard to say, but he&rsquo;s definitely much stronger than your granddaughter and my Xiaoxiao,&rdquo; Ningyu Shangren said.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure about that. I don&rsquo;t know about your Xiaoxiao, but my granddaughter hasn&rsquo;t fully awakened her bloodline yet.&rdquo; Mo Chengzhou was unwilling to concede on this.<br>Ningyu Shangren smiled at his rebuttal, not refuting him in the least, but Mo Chengzhou was already starting to lose confidence.<br>&ldquo;Fine fine fine. My granddaughter is indeed not on par with Chu Feng, but she wouldn&rsquo;t lose to him by too much. Speaking of which, it isn&rsquo;t rare for us to encounter such a talented prodigy. Why don&rsquo;t you take him in as your disciple?&rdquo; Mo Chengzhou asked with a probing gaze..<br>Ningyu Shangren stared at Chu Feng with a contemplative look in her eyes.<br>&ldquo;Are you sure that you aren&rsquo;t moved at all? Look at how talented he is! He&rsquo;s definitely far better than those two depraved wastrels you are keeping under your wing, Cheng Tianchan and Zhao Yunmo. Honestly speaking, I have no idea why you haven&rsquo;t kicked them yet. When you finally reveal your true identity and rise through the ranks, those two would only drag your reputation through the mud,&rdquo; Mo Chengzhou pressed on.<br>However, Ningyu Shangren continued to assess the surroundings in complete silence.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make a move if you aren&rsquo;t going to. He would make a good partner for my granddaughter,&rdquo; Mo Chengzhou added.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re finally getting to the point. You can just say so if you wish to take Chu Feng in as your disciple. There&rsquo;s no need for you to beat around the bush,&rdquo; Ningyu Shengren said.<br>&ldquo;Heh, I thought that a gentleman like me should give priority to the ladies. So, are you moved or not?&rdquo; Mo Chengzhou asked.<br>&ldquo;I am moved, but I don&rsquo;t think that he&rsquo;d dare to act so brazenly if he really came to the Totem Galaxy all alone. He must have someone behind him,&rdquo; Ningyu Shangren said.<br>Mo Chengzhou&rsquo;s eyes narrowed.<br>&ldquo;Are you suggesting that Chu Feng is related to that person from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy? It can&rsquo;t be that he&rsquo;s that person&rsquo;s disciple or descendant?&rdquo; Mo Chengzhou asked.<br>Ningyu Shangren affirmed those words with silence.<br>&ldquo;Is that person finally going to make an appearance after so many years? It looks like the world of cultivation is soon going to have the name &lsquo;Martial Ancestral Galaxy&rsquo; imprinted in their minds,&rdquo; Mo Chengzhou said.<br>Ningyu Shangren suddenly smiled upon hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re thinking too much. That person is indeed formidable to be able to guard the Eastern Region to this date, but you should remember that none of the galaxy overlords are to be made light of,&rdquo; Ningyu Shangren said.<br>&ldquo;I know that it&rsquo;s impossible for an individual to go against those behemoths. With the inception of God&rsquo;s Era, the center of attention has now been on the talented juniors. If Chu Feng stirs ripples at a time like this, people will be reminded of the Ancestral Martial Galaxy too,&rdquo; Mo Chengzhou said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. Chu Feng does have the potential to go against the prodigies of the current era. It&rsquo;ll be a good show to watch if that person is truly protecting him,&rdquo; Ningyu Shangren said.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no point cooking up blind conjectures here. We&rsquo;d just look like fools if Chu Feng isn&rsquo;t related to that person at all,&rdquo; Mo Chengzhou said.<br>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you give it a try then?&rdquo; Ningyu Shangren asked.<br>&ldquo;Try what?&rdquo; Mo Chengzhou asked.<br>&ldquo;Try making a move on Chu Feng. If someone is protecting him, they won&rsquo;t let you hurt him,&rdquo; Ningyu Shangren said.<br>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you try it yourself then?&rdquo; Mo Chengzhou scoffed.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dare to. I&rsquo;m afraid of death,&rdquo; Ningyu Shangren replied.<br>&ldquo;Do I look like I want to die?&rdquo; Mo Chengzhou sneered.<br>They knew<br>that person<br>&rsquo;s personality too well. If Chu Feng was truly his disciple or descendant, they could potentially lose their lives over this.<br></div>
