        <h1>Chapter 3904</h1>
        <div> - Generational Family Treasure<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Gou Zhen is a lackey of Gou Yukuang.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;My grandfather, father and mother were all killed by Gou Yukuang.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I am to become Gou Zhen&rsquo;s lackey, it would be akin to becoming my enemy&rsquo;s lackey.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although I, Gou Za, am a coward, and afraid of death, I am unwilling to do that sort of thing even if being killed is the alternative,&rdquo; said Gou Za.<br>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the case. In that case, you&rsquo;re still quite brave. I your daddy have a whole new level of respect for you,&rdquo; with a smile on his face, Chu Feng patted Gou Za&rsquo;s shoulder.<br>&ldquo;Milord, please don&rsquo;t mock this lowly one,&rdquo; Gou Za acted embarrassingly. However, it could be seen that he still felt joyous and proud from being praised by Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Do you need me to help you take care of that Gou Yukuang?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;No, Milord, please don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Gou Za immediately turned tense after hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? Don&rsquo;t you want to avenge your grandfather and parents?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I do, of course I do. Even in my dreams I think of avenging them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I want to kill Gou Yukuang personally. I do not want to borrow help from others.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If Milord is to kill him for me, it would not be me having avenged my grandfather and parents,&rdquo; said Gou Za.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded. He felt what Gou Za said to be very reasonable.<br>&ldquo;In that case, take these.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he took out a Cosmos Sack and tossed it to Gou Za.<br>&ldquo;Milord, what is this?&rdquo;<br>Although Gou Za and others had utensils for storing items, they were different from Cosmos Sacks. Thus, it was his first time seeing a Cosmos Sack.<br>&ldquo;Let me teach you how to use it.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng began to teach Gou Za how to use the Cosmos Sack.<br>&ldquo;Heavens! This&hellip; Milord, this lowly one couldn&rsquo;t possibly accept this, I couldn&rsquo;t possibly accept this.&rdquo;<br>After opening the Cosmos Sack, Gou Za immediately pushed it back to Chu Feng.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng had placed a lot of cultivation resources in the Cosmos Sack.<br>Although those cultivation resources were not very helpful for him, they were simply priceless treasures for Gou Za.<br>The was the reason for Gou Za&rsquo;s intense reaction. He simply did not dare to accept those cultivation resources.<br>&ldquo;Do you still want to avenge your parents and grandfather?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you do, accept them.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng tossed the Cosmos Sack back to Gou Za.<br>&ldquo;Milord, I&hellip;&rdquo;<br>After accepting the Cosmos Sack again, Gou Za was slightly hesitant.<br>Evidently, Chu Feng&rsquo;s words had incentivized him.<br>Indeed, he needed to avenge his parents and grandfather. In the martial cultivation world, cultivation resources were indispensable. No matter how talented one might be, one&rsquo;s future prospects would still be limited without sufficient resources.<br>If Gou Za were to rely solely on himself, he might not be able to get revenge in his entire life.<br>The cultivation resources Chu Feng had presented him had provided him an opportunity.<br>In fact, the instant he saw the cultivation resources, he saw the opportunity to get revenge.<br>&ldquo;Remember, do not sell these cultivation resources. In fact, do not show them to anyone. You can only use them yourself. In fact, you must even keep that sack well-hidden. Do not let anyone see it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Otherwise&hellip; it might bring forth the danger of death upon you. Even your grandmother will not be able to escape from it,&rdquo; Chu Feng warned Gou Za in a very serious manner.<br>The reason why Chu Feng warned Gou Za like that was naturally because his cultivation resources and Cosmos Sack were all things that were not present in their world.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation resources belonged to his era, whereas the cultivation resources of the Galewind Hunting Clan were, evidently, still a continuation of the Ancient Era.<br>&ldquo;Milord, please rest assured. I will definitely safekeep everything.&rdquo;<br>Gou Za was very prudent. As he spoke, he immediately and carefully put away the Cosmos Sack Chu Feng had given him.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about time for me to leave,&rdquo; as Chu Feng spoke, he stood up with the intention to leave.<br>&ldquo;Milord, please wait.&rdquo;<br>However, right after Chu Feng stood up, Gou Za&rsquo;s grandmother suddenly arrived beside him.<br>&ldquo;Milord, it is all thanks to you today. If it wasn&rsquo;t for you, Gou Za and myself would both have been killed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We people from the Dog Clan are all very poor. Thus, there&rsquo;s nothing much I can use to repay you for your grace.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This here is our family&rsquo;s generational treasure. It is something passed on by our ancestors.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Milord, you must definitely accept it.&rdquo;<br>As Gou Za&rsquo;s grandmother spoke, she took out a piece of paper and handed it to Chu Feng.<br>That paper was the same paper she had given Gou Zhen earlier, only to have Gou Zhen rip it to shreds.<br>Merely, after Chu Feng massacred Gou Zhen and his lackeys, Gou Za&rsquo;s grandmother gathered up the paper fragments and reassembled them.<br>Chu Feng casually accepted the paper. After accepting the paper, he didn&rsquo;t know what to say.<br>It emitted an intense Ancient Era&rsquo;s aura. This meant that the paper was something from the Ancient Era.<br>However, apart from the fact that it was something from the Ancient Era, the paper did not have any other redeeming qualities.<br>Firstly, the paper itself was very frail. That was evident by how Gou Zhen was able to easily tear it to pieces.<br>On the paper was an animal. That animal was very ugly. Furthermore, one simply could not make out what that animal was.<br>It resembled a child&rsquo;s scribble.<br>Most importantly, the piece of paper had been torn to pieces who-knew-how many times.<br>In other words, the piece of paper Gou Zhen had torn to pieces was in itself an already torn paper.<br>The paper had been torn apart and reassembled multiple times.<br>Likely, Gou Za&rsquo;s grandmother had taken out the paper stating that it was a treasure multiple times. Unfortunately, it seemed like she had only enraged those people more.<br>Even though the paper had been torn apart multiple times, Gou Za&rsquo;s grandmother continued to reassemble it.<br>Actually, Chu Feng could understand those people tearing apart the paper. After all, even he, with his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, was unable to determine what was special about the paper even after careful inspection.<br>That paper was indeed nothing more than trash.<br>&ldquo;Milord, you must definitely keep it safe.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is an Ancient Era&rsquo;s secret skill. As we possess mediocre aptitudes, we are unable to comprehend it. However, with how gifted Milord is, you will definitely be able to comprehend it,&rdquo; said Gou Za&rsquo;s grandmother.<br>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; as Chu Feng spoke, he planned to put the paper into his Cosmos Sack.<br>&ldquo;Milord, don&rsquo;t put it away like that. You must place it on your chest. It must be stuck to your skin.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason for that is because the secret skill has its own intelligence,&rdquo; said Gou Za&rsquo;s grandmother.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng felt rather helpless. It was nothing more than a piece of trash paper, yet he needed to go through so much trouble.<br>However, for the sake of making Gou Za&rsquo;s grandmother happy, he decided to place the paper inside his clothes and on his chest.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>The instant the paper came in contact with Chu Feng&rsquo;s chest, he felt a burst of pain in his chest. It seemed like something had pierced his heart.<br>Most importantly, Chu Feng&rsquo;s surroundings began to spin rapidly. His surroundings began to turn fuzzy.<br>Following that, Chu Feng entered an endless vortex. He was unable to control himself, and could only follow the frantic spinning of the vortex.<br>Inside that vortex, he became completely confused and disoriented.<br>When Chu Feng broke free from the vortex, he discovered that his surroundings had changed completely.<br>He was no longer in Gou Za&rsquo;s residence. Instead, he had entered a bizarre world.<br></p></div>
