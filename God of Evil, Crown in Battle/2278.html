        <div> - Unreasonable Demand<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;This guy is that Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing the emotional reaction from his master, Kou Kang was startled.<br>After all, he had also heard about Chu Feng&rsquo;s famous name. Chu Feng was an extremely renowned individual right now. He had heard that even the four first-tier powers had tossed olive branches at Chu Feng.<br>Why would someone like him be with Xu Yiyi?<br>Furthermore, it seemed that the two of them possessed an extraordinary relationship. Wouldn&rsquo;t this mean that he had a very powerful rival in love?<br>At that moment, Kou Kang felt an enormous pressure enveloping his entire body.<br>&ldquo;Rumors are truly inferior to seeing things for oneself. It turns out that not only does little friend Chu Feng possess extraordinary attainments in terms of world spirit techniques, you are also very much talented in terms of martial cultivation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I am the Three Stars Hall&rsquo;s Headmaster, Ouyang Yuqing. It is a pleasure to meet you, little friend Chu Feng,&rdquo; Right at that moment, the Three Stars Hall&rsquo;s headmaster walked toward Chu Feng and greeted him of his own accord.<br>&ldquo;I am Chu Feng. It is my pleasure to meet Headmaster Ouyang,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied courteously. After all, this man before him was an existence on the same level as the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master and Su Jingrui.<br>As for Kou Kang, he was truly surprised to see his master initiate a greeting toward a member of the younger generation like Chu Feng.<br>At the moment when Kou Kang was surprised, his master, who had always shielded him, suddenly revealed a serious expression. He said to Kou Kang, &ldquo;Kou Kang, you were rude toward little friend Chu Feng earlier. Why are you still not apologizing?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Master, I&hellip;&rdquo; Kou Kang looked to his master in shock. His gaze was filled with grievance.<br>As for Chu Feng, he stood to the side and reacted like an observer. He did not say anything. After all, he would not plead for leniency for someone like Kou Kang.<br>&ldquo;You what? Yiyi has already mentioned that Chu Feng did not do anything rude toward her. Yet you still attacked little friend Chu Feng. You are the one that is being rude here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why are you still not apologizing to little friend Chu Feng? Have you forgotten my usual guidance?&rdquo; The Three Stars Hall&rsquo;s Headmaster berated Kou Kang again. His tone was very strict.<br>Being intimidated by his own master, even though Kou Kang was very unwilling, he still clasped his fist toward Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, it was I, Kou Kang, who was impulsive earlier.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; Chu Feng reacted very casually to Kou Kang&rsquo;s apology. It was as if he did not appreciate that apology at all.<br>The Three Stars Hall&rsquo;s Headmaster did not say anything about Chu Feng&rsquo;s reaction. After all, his disciple&rsquo;s apology was not sincere either.<br>&ldquo;Say, the two of you are in the wrong here. You&rsquo;ve clearly managed to invite little friend Chu Feng, why did you two instead tell me that you haven&rsquo;t managed to invite an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, and stated that you would receive my punishment?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Old fellows, could it be that the two of you are deliberately playing with me?&rdquo; The Three Stars Hall&rsquo;s Headmaster looked to the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master and Su Jingrui in a slightly displeased manner.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the case. Although little friend Chu Feng is our esteemed guest, we have not asked little friend Chu Feng to participate in our matter. As such, he does not know about it,&rdquo; The Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master explained.<br>&ldquo;Lord Valley Master, since I&rsquo;ve already heard about this matter now, if you do not mind, I wish to spar against the Immortal-cloak World Spiritist invited by the Three Stars Hall on behalf of the Sunset Cloud Valley,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, are you serious?&rdquo; Hearing those words, the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master and Su Jingrui were overjoyed.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng has just become an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. I happen to want to find seniors to swap pointers with. Today would be a rare opportunity for me to do so,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Someone like you think you can spar with me?&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, another figure flew out from the palace in the distance.<br>It was another old man. Merely, that old man had a head of blonde hair and a face full of blonde beard.<br>Furthermore, on his head was a headdress with a golden star on it.<br>That old man&rsquo;s aura was not very strong. At least, his aura was inferior to the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master, the Three Stars Hall&rsquo;s Headmaster and Su Jingrui.<br>However, he possessed a different sort of symbol on his body. It was the clothes he was wearing. It was a world spiritist cloak.<br>Immortal-level world spirit power was hovering around his world spiritist cloak. Although it was only Insect Mark Immortal-level spirit power, he was most definitely an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.<br>Evidently, he was that Daoist Gold Star.<br>After Daoist Gold Star appeared, he immediately cast his gaze at Chu Feng. Merely, his gaze was filled with displeasure and disdain. &ldquo;Are you certain that you want to spar against me?&rdquo;<br>Seeing that the attitude of that Daoist Gold Star was very bad, Chu Feng did not present a good attitude either. Instead, he laughed coldly and then said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist and I&rsquo;m also an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. Why can&rsquo;t I spar against you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are you implying that you are not an Insect Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, but instead a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist? If you are a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, I will concede right now.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s words were evidently aggressive. After all, Daoist Gold Star was evidently only an Insect Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.<br>&ldquo;Humph, even if we&rsquo;re both Insect Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists, there is still a difference in how strong one might be.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You are merely someone who has just managed to obtain Insect Mark Immortal-level spirit power. You cannot be considered to be an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist yet.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, you are still not qualified to spar against me,&rdquo; Daoist Gold Star said.<br>&ldquo;Daoist Gold Star, it is not up to you to decide whether or not little friend Chu Feng is qualified to spar against you. Instead, it is up to our Sunset Cloud Valley to decide,&rdquo; The Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master said. His tone was quite ill intended too.<br>&ldquo;Since your Sunset Cloud Valley insists on humiliating yourselves, I am willing to help you accomplish your aim.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, the title of an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist is not something that one can bring dishonor to. This is especially true for a brat like him,&rdquo; Daoist Gold Star looked to Chu Feng. With a cold tone, he said, &ldquo;I am willing to spar with you in terms of world spirit techniques. However, if you lose, then you are not allowed to declare yourself an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist again.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Then what if you are to lose?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;It is impossible for me to lose,&rdquo; Daoist Gold Star said confidently.<br>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you too overconfident? This could no longer be considered confidence, but rather arrogance instead,&rdquo; Chu Feng mocked.<br>&ldquo;Very well, let&rsquo;s assume that it&rsquo;s possible that I might lose. I will do whatever you want me to do. How about it?&rdquo; Daoist Gold Star said confidently.<br>&ldquo;If you are to lose, I will not want you to do anything too excessive. I merely want you to apologize to me publicly,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Apologize to you?&rdquo; Although he declared that he would do anything if he were to be defeated, Daoist Gold Star revealed a displeased expression upon hearing Chu Feng demanding an apology.<br>&ldquo;What, are you afraid?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Afraid? Why would I be afraid of someone that I will defeat?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Very well, this old man shall agree to your demand. If I am to lose, I will publicly apologize to you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if I am to win, I want to add another demand for you,&rdquo; Daoist Gold Star said.<br>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;I want you to kneel on the ground and apologize to me,&rdquo; Daoist Gold Star said those words one word at a time.<br>&ldquo;Gold Star, is this not too excessive?&rdquo; Su Jingrui&rsquo;s eyebrows narrowed as he spoke coldly.<br>&ldquo;Daoist Gold Star, little friend Chu Feng has not done anything to humiliate you. Why must you demand an apology from him?&rdquo; The Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master was also very displeased.<br>&ldquo;Someone of his quality actually wants to spar against me. That itself is an insult toward me,&rdquo; Daoist Gold Star said.<br>Xu Yiyi was unable to watch it anymore and declared, &ldquo;But you clearly put forth a demand earlier. Yet now you want to add another demand. This is simply unfair.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He wishes to spar against me with his mere status. Do you think that is fair?&rdquo; Daoist Gold Star said.<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo; Hearing those words, both the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master and Su Jingrui were furious. The reason for that was because Daoist Gold Star was truly too conceited.<br>&ldquo;Very well, I agree to your conditions,&rdquo; However, to everyone&rsquo;s surprise, Chu Feng actually agreed to Daoist Gold Star&rsquo;s irrational demands.<br><br></p></div>
