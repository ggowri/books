        <h1>Chapter 4029</h1>
        <div> - Target: Ying Zhuanghong<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd were all flabbergasted upon witnessing this scene.<br>That was an Utmost Exalted-level expert. Yet, he had been killed just like that?<br>He'd been so easily killed that everyone wondered just who exactly was inside the war chariot?<br>No matter who it might be, they were most definitely very powerful. Furthermore, they&rsquo;d come with ill-intentions.<br>Still, who were they?<br>Could it be people related to the Wind Lightning Sword Sect, Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain or All-heaven Sect? Could they have come to avenge them?<br>The crowd had started making all sorts of guesses, yet not a single person knew who the people inside the war chariot were.<br>Nevertheless, seeing that the situation had turned bad, no one dared to act rashly. Even the elders of the Red-dress Holy Land waited quietly, not daring to do anything.<br>Finally, the war chariot arrived before the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>Three silhouettes walked out from the war chariot.<br>They were three men, and all wore the same attire.<br>They were all clad in elegant white gowns.<br>Most importantly, like the war chariot, clouds and mist hovered around their clothes.<br>As such, it was simply impossible to see what they looked like. One could only make out a rough outline of their silhouettes.<br>Although the crowd could only make out rough outlines, they were able to tell that those three were all handsome and impressive-looking.<br>They most likely possessed some sort of concealment treasure. As such, their ages and cultivations could not be determined.<br>That said, their imposing airs still brought great pressure to the people present. Some were so scared that they didn&rsquo;t even dare to breathe deeply.<br>They were afraid that in a moment of inattentiveness, they might provoke the three men and court a fatal disaster.<br>Although those three men were well-concealed, Chu Feng&rsquo;s sharp perception was able to sense their gazes the moment they appeared.<br>At practically that exact moment, their gazes were fixed on a single person.<br>That person was the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s top disciple, Yin Zhuanghong.<br>Their gazes caused Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart to tense up.<br>Their gazes made Chu Feng realize that their goal was Yin Zhuanghong and not the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>Han Xiu evidently also felt those people&rsquo;s gazes. Thus, she stood before Yin Zhuanghong to shield her before speaking, &ldquo;Friends, may I know who you are and why you&rsquo;ve come to my Red-dress Holy Land?&rdquo;<br>The man leading the three sized up Han Xiu before speaking, &ldquo;Are you the headmaster of the Red-dress Holy Land?&rdquo;<br>His voice sounded very young. Yet, it was also filled with arrogance. He spoke as if he was looking down on Han Xiu.<br>&ldquo;I am. And you might be...?&rdquo;<br>Han Xiu knew that whoever those people were, they were not simple. Thus, even she was cautious when she spoke.<br>&ldquo;Trash like you are not qualified to know our identities,&rdquo; said the man.<br>His words had completely baffled many of the people present.<br>Who was Han Xiu? She was the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster, and possessed a cultivation of rank three Utmost Exalted.<br>Now that the All-heaven Sect had been wiped out, the Red-dress Holy Land was to become the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s new overlord.<br>Although the person everyone felt reverence for was Zhao Hong, it remained that Han Xiu would serve nominally as the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s new ruler.<br>Yet, that person actually called her trash?<br>His words were not only an insult to Han Xiu, they were also an insult to everyone present.<br>Yin Zhuanghong was no longer able to tolerate their behavior. Han Xiu was her most esteemed master. How could she allow others to insult her like that?<br>She wanted to walk forward and criticize the man. However, she was pulled back by Han Xiu. Nevertheless, she still spoke angrily while pointing at the man, &ldquo;Who are you to dare speak to my master in such a manner?!&rdquo;<br>Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s words caused everyone&rsquo;s hearts to tense up.<br>Those people were of unknown origin and extremely tyrannical in their behavior. Merely because Zhao Yongzhou had decided to block them they'd killed him. From this, one could tell how ruthless those people were.<br>Even Han Xiu was courteous to them.<br>Yet, Yin Zhuanghong had actually spoken in such a manner. Who knew what would happen because of that?<br>However, to everyone&rsquo;s surprise, the man did not get angry. Rather, he laughed meaningfully.<br>&ldquo;Quite a temper. Exactly the same as your mother.&rdquo;<br>His words not only shocked Yin Zhuanghong, they also shocked Han Xiu and many others from the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>Different from others, they, as people of the Red-dress Holy Land, all knew who Yin Zhuanghong was.<br>She had been taken in by Han Xiu and had been nurtured in the Red-dress Holy Land since she was a young child.<br>Furthermore, her eyes were very special. That was something known only to the upper echelons of the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>In addition to her sharp eyes, Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s talent for martial cultivation went without saying.<br>Everyone felt that her future accomplishments would be unbounded.<br>Because of that, she'd been nurtured as the future headmaster of the Red-dress Holy Land from the very start.<br>However, the people of the Red-dress Holy Land did not know Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s origin.<br>The reason for that was because she was an orphan that had been picked up by Han Xiu.<br>Yet at that moment, the man before them actually said that Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s temper was exactly like her mother&rsquo;s. This implied that the man knew her origins.<br>Furthermore, those people were most likely acquainted with her family.<br>Because of that, Han Xiu and the others of the Red-dress Holy Land immediately knew realized the reason behind their sudden arrival.<br>They were most definitely there for Yin Zhuanghong.<br>&ldquo;Friends, exactly who are you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that you know Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s parents?&rdquo;<br>Upon discovering that those people had something to do with Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s origins, Han Xiu immediately questioned them.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already told you that trash like yourself is not qualified to know who we are.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, we will be bringing Yin Zhuanghong away today.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason for that is because a place like this is not qualified to keep her.&rdquo;<br>As the man spoke, his body shifted. He managed to move around Han Xiu and arrive before Yin Zhuanghong. Furthermore, he had extended his arm with the intention of forcibly grabbing Yin Zhuanghong.<br>Seeing that, Han Xiu would naturally not agree to it. She released her oppressive might with the intention to protect her.<br>&ldquo;Scram.&rdquo;<br>However, that man merely waved his sleeve, and a violent wind sprung up.<br>The wind was so strong that it not only dispersed Han Xiu&rsquo;s oppressive might, it even sent her flying.<br>With his action, the man had also unleashed his oppressive might.<br>Everyone could sense that his cultivation was above Han Xiu&rsquo;s.<br>His cultivation was that of a rank five Utmost Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>In the next instant, another figure appeared suddenly. She appeared beside Han Xiu and rescued her from the violent wind.<br>That person then grabbed Yin Zhuanghong and distanced herself from the man.<br>Once that person appeared, cheers immediately sounded from the surroundings.<br>The reason for that was because the person who had appeared was none other than Zhao Hong.<br>&ldquo;You dare obstruct me?&rdquo;<br>Having Yin Zhuanghong snatched away by Zhao Hong, the man became rather displeased.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>He took a step forward. Even though it was merely a single soft step, he managed to instantly close a distance of many thousand meters. With a single step, he had arrived before Zhao Hong.<br>At the same time, violent wind burst forth and oppressive might engulfed the surroundings. The man attacked. He raised his hand and shot a punch towards Zhao Hong&rsquo;s face.<br>This time around, he not only planned to capture Yin Zhuanghong, he was also launching a direct attack at Zhao Hong.<br>However, facing the man&rsquo;s attack, Zhao Hong merely moved her body to avoid it. Not only did she easily dodge the punch, she even raised her hand to shoot forth a palm strike in response.<br>However, the man was evidently not someone to be trifled with. Facing Zhao Hong&rsquo;s powerful palm that carried intense wind with it, he did not dodge, but instead formed a fist with one hand and sent it out explosively to meet Zhao Hong&rsquo;s punch.<br>He planned to face Zhao Hong head-on.<br></p></div>
