        <h1>Chapter 4806</h1>
        <div>: Argument<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;What momentous contribution do you expect out of me when I&rsquo;ve just joined the sect? How can you be confident that I won&rsquo;t be able to do anything for the sect in the future? If the sect needs something from me, I&rsquo;m willing to brave through a sea of flame for it,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;If you really are that capable, you wouldn&rsquo;t need to use the supporting formation or have Duan Liufeng carry the blame for you,&rdquo; the sectmaster replied.<br>&ldquo;But the truth is that you&rsquo;re afraid of me. Are you worried I would surpass Lord Dugu Lingtian, or are you afraid that you aren&rsquo;t able to control me, that I might threaten your position?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, shut up!&rdquo;<br>Duan Liufeng was nearly scared out of his wits. He roared as Chu Feng while sending a voice transmission to him,<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you asking to be killed here? How can you talk back to the sectmaster like this? Hurry up and admit you&rsquo;re wrong, or else she might really kill you!&rdquo;<br>Duan Liufeng&rsquo;s voice was trembling with fear. He knew the sectmaster very well, and he knew that she was more than capable of killing Chu Feng outright.<br>Of course, Chu Feng was aware of the danger he was putting himself through. He knew that his rebuttal here would lead to many problems in the future. However, he had no choice but to push it through, or else he would really be expelled from the sect.<br>However, he wasn&rsquo;t blindly putting his life on the line here. He was confident that he wouldn&rsquo;t be killed here, and that was why he dared to argue against the sectmaster here.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>An unexpected sight occurred. The sectmaster actually burst into laughter out of sheer rage and let go of Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where you get your confidence from. If you really think that you can surpass Dugu Lingtian, I&rsquo;ll give you a chance to prove yourself.<br>&ldquo;Three days from now, I want you to break the record Dugu Lingtian has left in the Hidden Dragon Life Tower. If you&rsquo;re able to do it, I&rsquo;ll spare you from punishment and promote you to become a Hidden Dragon Disciple. If you fail, not only will I expel you from the sect, but I&rsquo;ll take your life as well!&rdquo;<br>After saying her piece, the sectmaster turned to Duan Liufeng and said, &ldquo;Duan Liufeng, don&rsquo;t think that you can do as you please just because you&rsquo;re the Hidden Dragon Chief Elder. I won&rsquo;t pursue this matter in view of your previous contribution, but you better tread carefully from now onward.&rdquo;<br>Before the sectmaster finished her words, she had already vanished from the scene.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you sure are brazen!&rdquo;<br>Duan Liufeng stood up and looked at Chu Feng. He really didn&rsquo;t know whether he should criticize Chu Feng for his actions or compliment him.<br>&ldquo;Regardless of the means, at least I&rsquo;ve managed to stay in the sect for now. This means that I&rsquo;ll be able to participate in the matchmaking convention tomorrow,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Putting aside the fact that it&rsquo;ll be hard for you to win the matchmaking convention, you&rsquo;re unlikely to be able to survive now,&rdquo; Duan Liufeng sighed softly.<br>&ldquo;What kind of place is the Hidden Dragon Life Tower?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>He knew that Duan Liufeng was worrying about him due to the promise he had made with the sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;The Hidden Dragon Life Tower is a place where people die. Not only is it extremely dangerous, but there&rsquo;s nothing to be earned out of it at all. Challenging the Hidden Dragon Life Tower carries no merit at all,&rdquo; Duan Liufeng said.<br>&ldquo;So, what kind of place is it?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked once more.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s put that aside for now. You should focus your efforts on the battle tomorrow. I&rsquo;ll tell you more about the Hidden Dragon Life Tower after that,&rdquo; Duan Liufeng said.<br>&ldquo;My apologies, Brother Duan. I&rsquo;ve dragged you down for today&rsquo;s matters,&rdquo; Chu Feng said remorsefully.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. It&rsquo;s just that you&hellip; Forget it. We&rsquo;ll talk more about this at a later date. Make sure that you rest well for tomorrow&rsquo;s fight. I&rsquo;ll be heading back first.&rdquo;<br>Duan Liufeng patted Chu Feng&rsquo;s shoulders before turning around to leave the area. As he was walking away, he couldn&rsquo;t help but heave a worried sigh.<br>Chu Feng was deeply moved by Duan Liufeng&rsquo;s sentiments. Despite having committed a grievous mistake, he was more worried about Chu Feng than himself. Duan Liufeng was really treating him like a younger brother.<br>&ldquo;Brother Duan, I&rsquo;ll surely repay your favor,&rdquo; Chu Feng swore solemnly.<br>&hellip;<br>Time passed quickly. Soon, a new day had arrived.<br>Chu Feng had spent the night without sleep, but the miracle he had been hoping for didn&rsquo;t arrive. He failed to decipher the final seal on the Hidden Dragon Soul Armor.<br>The moment he opened the door, he saw familiar faces standing before him, and he directed a smile at them. All of the people whom he was closer toin the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect had gathered at his doorstep, seemingly to cheer him on.<br>Xia Yan, Li Muzhi, Zhao Shi, Tu Yuanyuan&hellip;<br>There were also quite a few elders too, including the chief elder of the North Tortoise Hall and Duan Liufeng too.<br>Under the escort of the crowd, Chu Feng headed toward the combat ring of the matchmaking convention.<br>By the time he arrived, the area around the combat ring was already filled with huge crowds.<br>The combat ring was actually a treasure. Despite its seemingly small size, those who stepped onto it would realize that the space it contained was far larger than what they expected.<br>There was also a spectator stand surrounding the combat ring, and they extended all the way into the sky. Even so, they were all filled to the brim except for the VIP seats reserved for esteemed individuals in the sect.<br>Right beneath the dueling ring was a board that contained Chu Feng, Zuoqiu Youyu, and the other participants&rsquo; signatures. There was one signature that particularly stood out, reflecting the words &lsquo;Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple&rsquo; in scrawly handwriting.<br>It didn&rsquo;t look too impressive, but it was the center of attention of the crowd. The crowd seemed to be trying to deduce what kind of person the mysterious Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple was through his writing.<br>From the casual and ugly handwriting, some of them speculated that the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple might be an unruly person. They dared not to insult him carelessly in view that he was the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple, or else they would probably use far uglier words.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you still dare to come here?&rdquo;<br>While Chu Feng was looking around, he heard a voice filled with enmity in his ears. He raised his head and saw Zuoqiu Youyu sitting on one of the VIP seats. The latter was glaring at him with icy-cold eyes filled with killing intent.<br>Zuoqiu Youyu was determined to kill Chu Feng to avenge his older brother, and he had no qualms displaying it in public.<br>Of course, Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t planning to let Zuoqiu Youyu off after his attempt on his life back at the Yinyang Withered Well Realm either.<br>The grudge that stood between them would never end until one of them finally fell dead.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I dare you to step on the stage later on. Once I defeat the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple, the person you would have to face is me. The combat ring is sealed off from external interference, which means that not even the elders can save you. If you have guts, don&rsquo;t back down and step on the dueling ring later on. I&rsquo;ll make sure to take your life!&rdquo; Zuoqiu Youyu sneered.<br></p></div>
