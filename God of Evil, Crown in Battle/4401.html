        <div>: A Helpless Call For Help<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chu Feng told them about how he stumbled upon the members of the Soaring Flower Gazebo by luck, and how he stole their treasure and killed their disciples.<br>He also told them about how he met the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster at the city and how he defeated Zhao Xuanhe.<br>Naturally, he wouldn&rsquo;t leave out the details about how their seniors, the Eight Immortal Swordswomen of the Dao Sea, about how they initially were very critical of Chu Feng, but, due to the token they had given him, ended up protecting him<br>And most importantly of all, it was about how when he was in deep danger, the Lady of Dao Sea suddenly descended like a goddess and eradicated everyone from the Soaring Flower Gazebo.<br>This chain of events had really gripped the disciples of the Dao Sea by their hearts. They had never expected so many things to occur to Chu Feng shortly after they had parted.<br>They practically listened to his entire story with unblinking eyes, holding their breaths nervously as they waited in suspense for Chu Feng to finish the story.<br>Had it been anyone else telling them of the story, they would have surely placed him under the suspicion of exaggerating the details and bragging.<br>After all, ordinary people wouldn&rsquo;t dare to offend the Soaring Flower Gazebo, let alone kill their disciples!<br>But they didn&rsquo;t doubt Chu Feng&rsquo;s words at all. The fact that he had been invited here by their master seemed to be the most convincing evidence of all.<br>That was a sign that he had been acknowledged by the Lady of Dao Sea, and they trusted the Lady of Dao Sea&rsquo;s judgment.<br>From such a perspective, they didn&rsquo;t think that Chu Feng would lie to them.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing that I have been quite curious about. Why did the attitudes of your seniors, the Eight Immortal Swordswomen of the Dao Sea, suddenly change so drastically upon seeing that token?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>To be honest, he was quite baffled by the turn of events. He didn&rsquo;t think that the Eight Immortal Swordswomen of the Dao Sea would actually choose him, a stranger, over the illustrious Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster over a mere token.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because our master taught us to never give our token to others easily. Only those whom we are indebted to will have our token, and disciples of the Dao Sea are to view that person as a benefactor.&rdquo;<br>A pleasant voice suddenly sounded from the sky&mdash;it was Wang Yuxian.<br>&ldquo;Little junior, come here quick! You should hear about the adventures young master Chu Feng went through after parting with us!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really incredible. If he wasn&rsquo;t the one telling us about it, I would have never believed it to be true!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yeah, little junior. You should come and join us. It&rsquo;ll really open up your eyes!&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing Wang Yuxian, the disciples of the Dao Sea immediately beckoning her over excitedly. They wanted to share the interesting story with their little junior too.<br>&ldquo;Seniors, it&rsquo;d be my pleasure to listen to his stories, but there are some things that we have to deal with at the moment.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Wang Yuxian turned to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, my master is calling for you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Alright!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng rose into the air, and under Wang Yuxian&rsquo;s lead, he headed toward where the Lady of Dao Sea lived.<br>It was a small palace located at the heart of the island. The palace wasn&rsquo;t extravagant, but it was still exquisitely designed.<br>They two of them landed at the entrance of the palace, and Wang Yuxian gestured for Chu Feng to enter by himself.<br>&ldquo;Master, master!!!&rdquo;<br>It was at this moment that an exclamation sounded behind them.<br>It was from Song Feifei and the others.<br>There was a foreign face with them too. She was one of the Lady of Dao Sea&rsquo;s disciple too, but Chu Feng had never met her before.<br>This disciple wasn&rsquo;t hiding her cultivation, so Chu Feng could sense that she was extremely powerful. Just like the Eight Immortal Swordswomen of the Dao Sea, she was a rank two Martial Exalted level cultivator.<br>Other than her, there was an old man with them.<br>This old man was bound by a powerful formation, such that he kept groaning in agony. It was apparent that the formation was inflicting a great deal of pain on him.<br>It was obvious that this old man was not from the Dao Sea, but what was even more shocking was that Chu Feng was actually able to recognize that man&rsquo;s clothes.<br>He was from the Cloudsky Immortal Sect.<br>&ldquo;Master, this man barged into our territory and set up a formation to steal our power. However, he ended up triggering your formation, resulting in him getting trapped. How should we deal with him? Should we kill him?&rdquo;<br>The powerful female disciple asked from the entrance of the palace.<br>&ldquo;This is a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding I say! I didn&rsquo;t know that this land is taken! This old man was just trying to open up an item, and it just so happens that the item can only be opened on this land. I really didn&rsquo;t think that this land is taken by you, or else I wouldn&rsquo;t have intruded in here so recklessly!&rdquo; the old man exclaimed in agitation.<br>&ldquo;This voice&hellip;&rdquo;<br>As soon as the man started talking, Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyebrows shot up.<br>Wasn&rsquo;t this the voice of the hidden elder of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect that he heard when they took Yin Zhuanghong away from the Red-dress Holy Land back then?<br>Even though the elder hadn&rsquo;t appeared from the start to the end, he had spoken up many times to stop the crowd from the Cloudsky Immortal Sect from going too far.<br>If not for his words restraining them, the other members of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect would have surely been much harsher in their actions back then,<br>As such, Chu Feng still had a rather good impression of this old man.<br>&ldquo;Elder, it&rsquo;s you?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>As soon as Chu Feng spoke, Wang Yuxian, Song Feifei, and others widened their eyes in astonishment.<br>Clearly, they hadn&rsquo;t thought that Chu Feng would actually be acquainted with this intruder.<br>&ldquo;Ah&hellip; This young friend over here, do you know me?&rdquo;<br>Even this Elder Gongsun of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect was taken aback those words because he didn&rsquo;t recognize Chu Feng at all.<br>While he had heard from Lian Xi and his two companions that they had been saved by the young man named Asura whom they had met back at the Red-dress Holy Land, they hadn&rsquo;t informed him that Asura had changed his appearance and was assuming another identity.<br>As such, Elder Gongsun wasn&rsquo;t able to put the two together.<br>&ldquo;Elder, it&rsquo;s me. Do you still remember what happened at the Red-dress Holy Land?&rdquo; Chu Feng revealed his identity.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Asura, it&rsquo;s you&hellip; What are you doing here? I heard that you saved three disciples from our Cloudsky Immortal Sect not too long ago&hellip; Why would you be here all of a sudden?&rdquo;<br>Elder Gongsun was also taken aback by this turn of events. He would have never imagined that he would be able to meet a familiar face here.<br>In truth, he had made a lie. He knew just what kind of place the Dao Sea was, and he had heard about the tremendous prowess the Lady of Dao Sea possessed too.<br>However, he had no choice but to go ahead with it. The Cloudsky Immortal Sect had come here for the sake of opening this treasure, so despite the dangers involved, he knew that he had to make this trip here.<br>This was also why he told the other members of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect to leave first before heading here alone.<br>From the moment he got trapped in the Lady of Dao Sea&rsquo;s formation, he immediately knew that his chances of survival were extremely slim.<br>Yet, who could have thought that he would actually meet Asura here?<br>And form the looks of it, it would appear that Asura was on close terms with the people of the Dao Sea.<br>&ldquo;Elder, my name is actually Chu Feng. Asura is just an alias I used to conceal my identity back then,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;I see! So it&rsquo;s young friend Chu Feng&hellip; Young friend Chu Feng, are you on close terms with these fairies? If so, may I ask to plead with them on my behalf? I wasn&rsquo;t my intention to intrude onto their territory, and I really don&rsquo;t mean any harm to them,&rdquo; Elder Gongsun told Chu Feng with a wronged look on his face.<br>In truth, he also knew that it was likely to be futile to plead with Chu Feng. He had heard about just how kind of fearsome place the Dao Sea was, and it was very likely that no one would be able to save him if he were to encounter trouble here.<br>But he had no choice. Given the desperate situation he was in, he could only grasp onto every single straw of hope that was within reach to him. Or else, the only fate that awaited him was death!<br></p></div>
