        <h1>Chapter 4320</h1>
        <div>: What Use Is An Apology?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These Supreme Elders weren&rsquo;t just of high standing, they possessed tremendous strength as well.<br>This was especially so for the one who took the initiative to walk over and greet Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>His name was Long Duan, and his strength was not to be scoffed at. He was a Martial Exalted level expert.<br>With his level of strength, he was ranked in the forefront amongst the Supreme Elders of the Dragon Clan. Without a doubt, he was the strongest one of the Supreme Elders gathered here.<br>While every single one of these Supreme Elders wielded frightening powers, the one that everyone feared the most was no other than Long Duan.<br>It was just that Long Duan had a domineering personality, and he would always put on a taciturn front when conversing with others within the clan. Rarely would anyone see a smile on his face.<br>Yet, there was a beaming smile on his face when he saw Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. His eyes were glowing, as if he was looking at a precious treasure.<br>This made Long Pingfeng and Long Nanxun realize something&mdash;the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was no ordinary figure.<br>Otherwise, he wouldn&rsquo;t have been so warmly welcomed by Long Duan.<br>&ldquo;You know me?&rdquo;<br>But in contrast to the clearly excited Long Duan, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist simply shot a casual glance at him. His attitude wasn&rsquo;t just haughty, one could even see hints of disdain in the depths of his eyes.<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s attitude toward Long Duan was no different from how he treated the guards of the Dragon Clan. To be more exact, it seemed like nothing could catch his eye at all.<br>This infuriated everyone of the Dragon Clan.<br>Long Duan was a lofty Supreme Elder of their Dragon Clan! How could he be treated in such a manner?<br>But despite the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s disrespectful attitude, the smile on Long Duan&rsquo;s face never faded.<br>Long Duan&rsquo;s reaction left those of the Dragon Clan bewildered, but this verified their thoughts that there was indeed more to Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist than they knew of.<br>And it was far greater than what they had thought before.<br>But this wasn&rsquo;t any good news to Long Pingfeng and the other guards.<br>Even though they hadn&rsquo;t said a word thus far, their trembling bodies were more than enough to reflect the fear that they felt on the inside.<br>&ldquo;Milord, I am Long Duan, a Supreme Elder of the Dragon Clan. You might have never met me, but I have seen you before.<br>&ldquo;While my focus is mainly on martial cultivation, I am, in fact, a world spiritist too. My mastery in world spirit techniques is still sorely lacking, but I&rsquo;m extremely interested in this field.<br>&ldquo;To be honest with you, I was also present when the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain opened. It was just that there was a rule in the Holy Light Galaxy that cultivators aren&rsquo;t to interfere in the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain, so I chose to observe from afar in order to avoid unnecessary trouble.<br>&ldquo;However, I witnessed everything that has happened within the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain. I saw with my own eyes the means of both Milord and your disciple, and I&rsquo;m truly awestruck.<br>&ldquo;It was from that moment on that I was filled with respect toward the two of you. I thought to myself that should the opportunity arise, I would surely pay the two of you a visit and befriend you.<br>&ldquo;I never thought that Milord and young friend Chu Feng would actually come here. This has really been a pleasant surprise to me,&rdquo; Long Duan said.<br>&ldquo;Disciple?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Does this mean that this old man is Chu Feng&rsquo;s master?&rdquo;<br>Long Nanxun&rsquo;s eyes glowed in delight. He had also seen for himself just how powerful Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spiritist techniques were.<br>Back then, they were deeply curious as to who Chu Feng&rsquo;s master was, especially since they were convinced that Chu Feng&rsquo;s master was bound to be a formidable expert.<br>Yet, it was only at this moment that they realized that this old man with an ugly ox-like nose was actually Chu Feng&rsquo;s master.<br>Long Nanxun turned his gaze over to Ox-nose once more, but this time, his eyes were filled with deference.<br>He knew very well that Chu Feng&rsquo;s master was bound to be a powerful figure.<br>It was no wonder why even someone of Long Duan&rsquo;s caliber would maintain such a respectful attitude toward the hideous Ox-nose.<br>As for the others, while they didn&rsquo;t feel it as deeply as Long Nanxun did, they also came to realize that Ox-nose was an extremely formidable figure too.<br>They had heard some rumors about the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain, and they knew that Long Duan had gone there during its opening. It was just that Long Duan had just returned from there not too long ago, so they still had no idea about the happenings that transpired there.<br>However, based on what Long Duan had said, they could deduce that this master-disciple pair had accomplished something amazing in there.<br>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist nodded his head as his attitude softened a little.<br>At the very least, he wasn&rsquo;t looking at Long Duan in disdain anymore.<br>&ldquo;Milord, may I know how I should address you?&rdquo; Long Duan asked.<br>&ldquo;You can address me as Ox-nose,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist replied.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip; Wouldn&rsquo;t this be inappropriate?&rdquo;<br>From Long Duan&rsquo;s point of view, it didn&rsquo;t seem like a respectful way to address the other party.<br>And in truth, the name which the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was known by in the Ancestral Martial Starfield was not intended to be a flattering one either. Back then, while the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was recognized for his world spiritist techniques, most people still thought of him as an unreliable braggart.<br>So, they came up with such a name for him.<br>There was no doubt that it carried some hints of sarcasm in it.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so inappropriate about it? That&rsquo;s how everyone addresses me. You&rsquo;ll call me whatever I want you to,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Daoist snapped impatiently.<br>&ldquo;I understand. I&rsquo;ll address you as Lord Ox then,&rdquo; Long Duan replied.<br>With Long Duan&rsquo;s standing, it was already a sign of respect for him to address a world spiritist as &lsquo;Grandmaster&rsquo;. Yet, he chose to address the Ox-nosed Old Daoist as &lsquo;Lord&rsquo;. From this, it could be seen just how deeply he respected the latter.<br>Of course, it was also not without reason why he had such high regards for the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>Even though he had just returned to the Dragon Clan from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain not too long ago, as a Supreme Elder, he was tipped off right away about the peculiar happenings with the Dragon Vein Source<br>He was well aware that if there was anyone who could help the Dragon Clan open the Dragon Vein Source, it would be no other than the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>It was for this reason that he reined in his arrogance and put on a humble attitude before the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You are a Supreme Elder of the Dragon Clan?&rdquo; Ox-nose suddenly asked.<br>&ldquo;Yes, Lord Ox. These people beside me are Supreme Elders of the Dragon Clan as well. Milord, allow me to introduce you to them&hellip;&rdquo; Long Duan said as he began to introduce the Grand Elders behind to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>However, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist cut him off with an impatient wave of his hand.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to introduce them. I just want to know one thing,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.<br>&ldquo;Milord, what do you want to know?&rdquo; Long Duan asked.<br>&ldquo;Your Dragon Clan is a renowned power in the Holy Light Galaxy, so why are the younger generation you taught out so condescending?&rdquo;<br>As the Ox-nosed Old Daoist spoke, he shot a glance at Pingfeng, who was kneeling on the ground with his head lowered fearfully, before turning his eyes to the guards of the Dragon Clan, who had drawn their weapons on them earlier.<br>&ldquo;Who is going to explain to me what you did to Lord Ox and young friend Chu Feng?&rdquo; Long Duan raised his voice imposingly and questioned those gathered around.<br>&ldquo;Supreme Elder, allow me to fill you in on the details.&rdquo;<br>Long Nanxun stood forth and recounted the incident to Long Duan.<br>&ldquo;Ignorant fools! You have really thrown away the face of our Dragon Clan! What are you still dawdling around for? Hurry up and apologize to Lord Ox and young friend Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>Having learned everything that had happened, Long Duan turned to Long Pingfeng and roared at him.<br>Without daring to hesitate in the least, the kneeling Long Pingfeng and the other guards immediately apologized to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and Chu Feng.<br>In truth, those of the Dragon Clan would never kneel and apologize to outsiders easily. Even if they had done wrong, they would never put on such a humble attitude.<br>This was the lofty standing that they were born with.<br>But with Long Duan commanding them to do so, how could they possibly dare to defy his order?<br>But what was even more unexpected was that despite them having kneeled on the floor and apologized, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist sneered to himself and said, &ldquo;If an apology can solve everything, what need do we have for the rules? Is this how your Dragon Clan disciplines the younger generation? It&rsquo;s no wonder why all of them have such condescending attitudes.&rdquo;<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist explicitly displayed his displeasure toward how Long Duan tried to resolve this conflict.<br></p></div>
