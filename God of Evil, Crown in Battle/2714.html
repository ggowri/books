        <div> - Rank Two True Immortal<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;What happened? How come such a frightening divine lightning suddenly disappeared?&rdquo;<br>The crowd were all unable to take their eyes away from the sky. They all had expressions of confusion and bewilderment on their faces.<br>&ldquo;This couldn&rsquo;t be an abnormal sign caused by someone&rsquo;s breakthrough in cultivation, right? I&rsquo;ve never seen such frightening divine lightning from a breakthrough before,&rdquo; Someone said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not for certain. Perhaps there is an expert undergoing closed-door training here. Perhaps it is that expert that evoked such an abnormal sign.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, if someone managed to successfully reach a breakthrough, then that divine lightning would have definitely descended. Why is it that the divine lightning did not descend?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There could only be one explanation for that. The person that was attempting the breakthrough failed.&rdquo;<br>The crowd began to make all kinds of speculations. Some determined that it was a calamity that had dissipated for some unknown reason.<br>Some determined that it was a possessor of Heavenly Bloodline undergoing a breakthrough in cultivation.<br>However, even those that felt that it was an abnormal sign caused by a Heavenly Bloodline possessor felt that the Heavenly Bloodline possessor had failed in their attempt.<br>They felt that that was the reason why the divine lightning did not successfully descend upon them.<br>The crowd argued among themselves about what that divine lightning really was for a very long time. They seemed to have forgotten their purpose for being there.<br>All their discussions were only about a single subject -- that frightening divine lightning.<br>Practically no one cared about the hunt.<br>At the moment when the crowd was still discussing among themselves, Chu Feng, who was inside the hunting ground, opened his eyes.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng had an excited expression on his face. Even his aura had changed.<br>Chu Feng had successfully made a breakthrough, becoming a rank two True Immortal.<br>&ldquo;Amazing. You&rsquo;ve actually managed to successfully reach a breakthrough. The divine lightning from earlier was quite frightening. However, you&rsquo;ve managed to dissipate it so quickly this time around.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What is going on? Could it be because you&rsquo;ve received better martial comprehension that allowed you to decrease the amount of time you needed to endure the Divine Tribulation&rsquo;s lightning?&rdquo; Eggy asked curiously.<br>Although Her Lady Queen had been in Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spirit space the entire time, she was still capable of sensing how frightening the Divine Tribulation&rsquo;s lightning was this time around.<br>That Divine Tribulation&rsquo;s lightning was attacking Chu Feng frantically. It was truly terrifying.<br>Merely, the Divine Tribulation&rsquo;s lightning this time around arrived very fast and left very fast.<br>That was the reason why Her Lady Queen was so puzzled.<br>&ldquo;No, that shouldn&rsquo;t be the case. The martial comprehension I&rsquo;ve obtained this time was not even enough for me to be certain of being able to make a breakthrough,&rdquo; Chu Feng himself was actually also very puzzled.<br>&ldquo;Could this be what happens after you reach the True Immortal realm?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen guessed.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that's the case either,&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head.<br>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t be that it&rsquo;s because of this hunting ground, right?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>&ldquo;How could that be?&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head with a smile on his face.<br>&ldquo;How couldn&rsquo;t it be? What if this hunting ground is not merely an isolated space for conducting the hunt, but also a treasure capable of resisting the power of Self-Punishment Mysterious Techniques like Li Yue&rsquo;er&rsquo;s umbrella, only much stronger?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said with a beaming smile.<br>Although she said those words, she was clearly joking around.<br>She also did not think the hunting ground would possess that sort of ability.<br>&ldquo;This time was truly different from before. The power of the Divine Tribulation&rsquo;s lightning was extremely strong. However, it disappeared very quickly.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, I will know exactly what is going on once I attempt to breakthrough to rank three True Immortal,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Chu Feng was no longer just happy. Instead, he was overjoyed.<br>He simply had not even possessed any certainty of success in his breakthrough attempt this time around. Yet, he had managed to succeed.<br>Although his success this time around was a bit different from before, it remained that he had succeeded in reaching a breakthrough to rank two True Immortal.<br>With his new level of cultivation and various abilities, Chu Feng was now capable of contending against Chu Xianshuo.<br>&ldquo;Indeed. No matter what, you&rsquo;ve managed to obtain what you wanted.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Likely, at this moment, everyone outside the hunting ground is pondering exactly who managed to reach a breakthrough and give rise to the Divine Tribulation&rsquo;s lightning,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said with a beaming smile.<br>Hearing her words, the smile on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face grew even denser.<br>However, the two of them had no idea that while the Divine Tribulation&rsquo;s lightning did appear in the sky, it did not successfully strike down in the eyes of the people outside.<br>As a result, the people outside naturally had no idea that there was a Heavenly Bloodline possessor that managed to successfully reach a breakthrough inside the hunting ground.<br>&hellip;...<br>Finally, the tenth day of the hunt arrived.<br>Chu Xianshuo, who&rsquo;d been sitting on the viewing platform the entire time, finally stood up.<br>&ldquo;Look! Young master Chu Xianshuo has stood up. Could he be planning to enter the hunting ground?&rdquo;<br>Originally, the crowd was still discussing the divine lightning that had suddenly disappeared. However, once Chu Xianshuo stood up, the crowd all cast their eyes to him.<br>At that moment, the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s younger generations also stood up. They said to Chu Xianshuo, &ldquo;Brother Xianshuo, you must not disappoint us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Rest assured. As long as I enter the hunting ground, this hunt&rsquo;s first place will definitely be mine.&rdquo;<br>Chu Xianshuo had a smile of confidence on his face.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Xianshuo, the hunting ground this year is different from before. It is very dangerous inside. You must be extra careful,&rdquo; A black-gowned old man with long fiery red hair said to Chu Xianshuo enthusiastically.<br>Although he was telling Chu Xianshuo to be careful, his words were actually said in a warning-like manner. He was trying to tell Chu Xianshuo not to be overly confident, or else he would end up suffering.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that pleasant surprise you all have prepared, right? It seems that is not only a pleasant surprise, but also a danger,&rdquo; Chu Xianshuo said.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo; The old man laughed lightly. However, he didn&rsquo;t say anything.<br>&ldquo;However, I can tell you with certainty that no matter how dangerous of a pleasant surprise it might be, I, Chu Xianshuo, will still be able to obtain it,&rdquo; Chu Xianshuo spoke in a very confident manner.<br>&ldquo;You will not be able to obtain that pleasant surprise.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, an old man wearing the same sort of black gown and a long head of white hair walked over in midair.<br>&ldquo;We pay our respects to Lord Villa Master,&rdquo; Upon seeing the old man, everyone in the Immortal Armament Villa immediately bowed to him respectfully.<br>Even that fiery red-haired old man was no exception.<br>The reason for that was because that white-haired old man was the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master.<br>&ldquo;Villa Master, did you&hellip; manage to succeed in your closed-door training?&rdquo; The fiery red-haired old man asked with a happy expression on his face.<br>He had actually already managed to sense the change in the Villa Master&rsquo;s aura. He was merely asking for confirmation.<br>&ldquo;Mn, I&rsquo;ve entered closed-door training for half a year, and finally succeeded,&rdquo; The Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master replied with a faint smile on his face.<br>Although it was a very faint smile, one could tell from his eyes that he was extremely happy to have successfully reached a breakthrough.<br>After all, after reaching his level of cultivation, reaching a breakthrough in cultivation was an extremely difficult task.<br>He had failed many times. This success could be said to have been obtained through much difficulty.<br>&ldquo;Congratulations Lord Villa Master,&rdquo; At that moment, the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s crowd all started to congratulate their Villa Master.<br>The increase in the cultivation of their Villa Master was a happy occasion for the entire Immortal Armament Villa. Naturally, they would be overjoyed.<br>In fact, after finding out that their Villa Master had managed to reach a breakthrough, the entire Immortal Armament Villa burst into an uproar.<br>Even the people who were not part of the Immortal Armament Villa started to spiritedly discuss the matter.<br>They all knew that the position the Immortal Armament Villa held would likely rise again.<br>At that moment when everyone was overjoyed, that fiery red-haired old man suddenly took note of a crystal ball in the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master&rsquo;s hand.<br>That crystal ball was silvery white and flickering with light. The scenery inside was changing nonstop. It was as if it contained a world within.<br>&ldquo;Lord Villa Master, why did you say that little friend Chu Xianshuo would not be able to obtain the pleasant surprise?&rdquo; The fiery red-haired old man asked.<br>He knew very well that crystal ball was no ordinary ball. Instead, the crystal ball was linked to the hunting ground.<br>The crystal ball possessed another distinctive name. It was called a Mirror Pearl.<br>That Mirror Pearl was capable of clearly seeing the situation inside the hunting ground.<br>Since the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master had made such a declaration, it was clear that he had already seen the Mirror Pearl, and understood what the current situation inside the hunting ground was.<br>Likely, the situation inside the hunting ground was detrimental toward Chu Xianshuo.<br><br><br></p></div>
