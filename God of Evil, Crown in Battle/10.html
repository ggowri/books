        <div> &ndash; Failing to Honor a Debt<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that instant, the hall went into complete silence and all the gazes were cast towards Chu Yue.<br>&ldquo;Chu Yue, what did you say? You cannot speak such nonsense to testify.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Wei said that, his dense gaze was filled with implications of warning. His meaning was very clear and it was to make Chu Yue say the truth.<br>&ldquo;I am not speaking nonsense. That day, when Chu Zhen and Chu Feng made the bet, I was there and it was even Chu Zhen who let me be a witness.&rdquo;<br>After that, Chu Yue was not afraid of Chu Wei at all. She stood next to Chu Feng, as if hiddenly telling the crowd which side she was standing on.<br>At that moment, not only Chu Zhen, even Chu Cheng, Chu Wei and most of the Chu family&rsquo;s faces were starting to change.<br>They never would have thought that Chu Yue would do this for Chu Feng and she was even willing to go against the entire Chu family crowd.<br>In reality, even Chu Feng felt a bit surprised since by doing this, Chu Yue would offend a lot of people. But other than that, Chu Feng felt moved.<br>&ldquo;Chu Zhen, are you failing to honoryour debt?&rdquo; Chu Feng continued to pressure him. With Chu Yue as a witness, he did not believe that Chu Zhen would deny it.<br>&lsquo;&rdquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Zhen&rsquo;s face was extremely ugly and he did not know how to reply.<br>Every year, the family only supplemented one Saint Spirit Grass. Other than the one, they did not have any other chances to get such a good spiritual medicine.<br>He just got his supplemented Saint Spirit Grass and Chu Zhen was preparing to use it to make a breakthrough into the 4th level of the Spirit realm. How could he give it up to someone?<br>&ldquo;Hmph, so what if it&rsquo;s true?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You entered the Azure Dragon School at the same time as Chu Zhen. He already entered the inner court two years ago andyou are a full two years late.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What, after using that much time to enter the inner court, you&rsquo;re still arrogant? You want to extort Chu Zhen&rsquo;s supplement?&rdquo; Chu Cheng coldly smiled and cunningly argued. As Chu Zhen&rsquo;s elder brother, it was obvious that he wouldn&rsquo;t let Chu Feng take away his brother&rsquo;s supplement.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me that. Your brother should know what is happening.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you are failing to honoryour debt, just admit it. I canforget about it. But you need him to personally admit that his words are like fart and they are absolutely untrustable.&rdquo; Chu Feng did not let him go.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo; With those words, Chu Zhen was really gnashing his teeth out of anger yet he could not refute him since it was true.<br>&ldquo;Haha! Jokes! Failing to honora debt? Have I ever mentioned anything about that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You can have Chu Zhen&rsquo;s Saint Spirit Grass, but you need to admit in front of the crowd that you are a useless garbage. An idiot that needed five years to enter the inner court.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Everyone, am I correct?&rdquo; Chu Cheng yelled loudly.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Chu Cheng is right.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, if you want to take the Saint Spirit Grass, you need to admit that you are garbage. As long as you admit it, then we&rsquo;ll just give it as pity to a beggar.&rdquo; Chu Cheng raised his hands and yelled, and naturally, everyone yelled in response.<br>In the Chu family, excludingChu Yuan, Chu Guyu and Chu Yue, pretty much no one liked Chu Feng and they all wanted him out of the Chu family.<br>So no matter how excessive it was, as long as it was related to Chu Feng, they would support it. They all wanted Chu Feng to feel horrible.<br>&ldquo;Chu Cheng, don&rsquo;t create trouble without a reason. This is a private matter between Chu Zhen and Chu Feng so all of you are not qualified to interrupt.&rdquo; Chu Yue scolded.<br>&ldquo;We are not qualified, yet you are? You are the elder sister of Chu Zhen, but even so,you supported an outsider. Are you still even part of the Chu family?&rdquo; Chu Cheng maliciously and fiercely refuted.<br>&ldquo;I only look at the case and not the person. In any case, Chu Feng is not an outsider. He is part of the Chu family.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You clearly know whether or not he is part of the Chu family. However, I can tell you that Chu Zhen is your own brother.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t even bother to reason!&rdquo; Chu Yue was so angered by Chu Cheng that her entire body was trembling.<br>But just at that time, Chu Feng put his hands on Chu Yue shoulders, and movedher behind him.<br>Although the current Chu Feng had the same smile as always on his face, his gaze became serious and he said calmly,<br>&ldquo;I will only ask you one question. Willyou give this Saint Spirit Grass to me or no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ho.. Chu Feng, don&rsquo;t say that we are making things hard for you, but you really are not qualified to take Chu Zhen&rsquo;s Saint Spirit Grass.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How about this&hellip; I&rsquo;ll give you a chance. Duel a bit with Chu Zhen. If you win, that shows that you are qualified to take away this Saint Spirit Grass.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Yue, don&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;m not speaking reason. I&rsquo;ll even take my own Saint Spirit Grass out. If Chu Feng can win, then these areall his.&rdquo; While saying that, Chu Cheng put the Saint Spirit Grass from his pocket onto the table.<br>Also at the same time, Chu Cheng shot a glance at Chu Zhen. Chu Zhen instantly understood and he also put his Saint Spirit Grass onto the table.<br>&ldquo;Chu Zhen, you&rsquo;ve entered the inner court for two years, and you&rsquo;ve also cultivated two skills.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;On the other hand,Chu Feng just entered the inner court. Don&rsquo;t you feel ashamed dueling with him? You just aren&rsquo;t willing to give it up.&rdquo; Chu Yue still felt that it was unfair towards Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Shut up. You don&rsquo;t have any part in this.&rdquo; Chu Cheng threateningly pointed at Chu Yue, then narrowed his eyes and looked at Chu Feng,<br>&ldquo;But, if you lose, bring your Saint Spirit Grass out. Do you dare?&rdquo;<br>At that instant, all the eyes landed on Chu Feng and they were waiting for his reply.<br>If Chu Feng refused, they could humiliate Chu Feng and say that he was a coward. If Chu Feng agreed, Chu Zhen could openly give Chu Feng a lesson.<br>No matter what, Chu Feng was in a dangerous spot. They only wanted to see how Chu Feng would be humiliated.<br>&ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t I dare?&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled and agreed.<br>&ldquo;Good, you have the guts. But let&rsquo;s say this first. Fists and kicks don&rsquo;t have eyes, so you cannot complain about any injuries.&rdquo; Chu Cheng&rsquo;s smile became even more despicable.<br>&ldquo;Enough with the rubbish. Come at me.&rdquo; Chu Feng put his own Saint Spirit Grass on the table, then walked to the middle of the hall.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Yue pulled on Chu Feng, and those flickering eyes were urging him not to duel with Chu Zhen.<br>But Chu Feng pushed away Chu Yue&rsquo;s hands with a smile and said, &ldquo;Trust me.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that, Chu Yue couldn&rsquo;t help but have a blank look. For some reason, she had a feeling that Chu Feng would undoubtedly win this round.<br>Chu Feng and Chu Zhen walked towardsthe middle of the hall and everyonesurrounded them. They didn&rsquo;t want to miss out on Chu Feng&rsquo;s humiliation.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, it seems that you want the riches but not your life.&rdquo;<br>The Chu Zhen that hadn&rsquo;t spoke in a long time finally had a smile on his face, but his smile was very evil.<br>Being forced into the embarrassing situation by Chu Feng made him very unhappy. Since he had a chance to teach Chu Feng a lesson, obviously, he wouldn&rsquo;t restrain himself.<br>&ldquo;Hoho.&rdquo; Chu Feng lightly smiled then said, &ldquo;I just wanted to say those words to you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You talk too big. Today, I&rsquo;ll let you know how weak you are.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Zhen&rsquo;s left feet stepped forward. Onecould only hear a boom before his entire body ran with flying speed.<br>Both his arms were moving and his punches were flying everywhere. Powerful aura came from his body and he was like a wild Fierce Beast as he headed towards Chu Feng.<br></p></div>
