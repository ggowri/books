        <div> - The Person The Holy Daughter Was Waiting For<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, that girl seems to be waiting for you. How about you go and see her?&rdquo;<br>Whilst drinking with Chu Feng, Yuan Shu suddenly looked at him with a profound look. The smile on his face seemed to be slightly teasing too.<br>Chu Feng stood up and asked, &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng knew that the girl Yuan Shu spoke of must be Yin Zhuanghong.<br>Originally, Chu Feng had already forgotten about it.<br>However, after hearing Yuan Shu&rsquo;s words, he suddenly remembered.<br>Earlier, Yin Zhuanghong had told Chu Feng to not leave the Seven Suns Mountain Range, and instead wait for her.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Yuan Shu pointed his finger beside Chu Feng. Then he drew a circle, and light started to rush forth. A spirit formation gate then appeared beside Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Pass through this spirit formation gate, and you&rsquo;ll be able to meet her,&rdquo; said Yuan Shu.<br>&ldquo;That girl must have something she needs me for. Brother Yuan Shu, I might not be able to stay here for long,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, I&rsquo;ve already said all that I should. The Reincarnation Upper Realm is truly not peaceful right now. The Seven Suns Mountain Range is the safest place. You must consider things carefully," said Yuan Shu.<br>&ldquo;Ever since I entered the martial cultivation world, I&rsquo;ve constantly gotten myself caught up in dangers. That said, I still must thank brother Yuan Shu for the warning." Chu Feng clasped his fist and expressed his thanks.<br>&ldquo;If you wish to return to this place, you can come at any time.&rdquo;<br>As Yuan Shu spoke, he tossed a title plate to Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng received the title plate, and was able to sense the spirit power contained within.<br>The spirit power in the title plate was identical to that of the protective formation that covered the Seven Suns Mountain Range.<br>Chu Feng knew that with the title plate in hand, even if the Seven Suns Mountain Range closed again, he would still be able to enter.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, brother Yuan Shu.&rdquo; Chu Feng clasped his fist and expressed his thanks again.<br>&ldquo;Since we&rsquo;re already addressing each other as brothers, there&rsquo;s no need to be so courteous with me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Your brother is someone with some face in the Reincarnation Upper Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If someone is to make things difficult for you, you can tell them that you&rsquo;re my brother. With that title plate in hand, they will definitely believe you," said Yuan Shu.<br>&ldquo;Very well." Chu Feng no longer tried to be courteous, and put the title plate away. Then, his facial appearance changed again to that of Asura.<br>&ldquo;Brother Yuan Shu, I will be taking my leave now. I will come and pay a visit to you again some time later,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Go quickly, don&rsquo;t make a young girl wait too long. You must know that girl&hellip; is the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s number one beauty,&rdquo; Yuan Shu spoke with a mischievous smile.<br>Even though Yuan Shu was an existence akin to Grandmaster Liangqiu in the All-heaven Starfield, he was still very young, and gave off a completely different sort of feeling from Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>At the very least, Yuan Shu made Chu Feng feel like he was a peer of similar age.<br>Being together with Yuan Shu, Chu Feng was able to talk without holding anything back. They got along very well.<br>After Chu Feng changed his appearance, he set foot into the spirit formation gate.<br>When Chu Feng walked out from the spirit formation gate, he discovered that he was at a corner of the plaza.<br>The plaza was packed with people, and he appeared directly amongst the crowd.<br>Chu Feng turned around, and discovered that there was no spirit formation gate behind him.<br>Apart from the people right next to Chu Feng that were shocked by how he had suddenly appeared, the others did not take note of him.<br>It was not without reason that there were so many people gathered in the plaza. The reason for the gathering of all these people was Yin Zhuanghong. She stood right in the center of the plaza.<br>Who was Yin Zhuanghong? She was the Reincarnation Upper Realm&rsquo;s Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Daughter, the number one beauty of the All-heaven Starfield.<br>When the crowd saw her, they reacted like a pack of wolves seeing a sheep. The men&rsquo;s eyes all shine. There were even people wiping their mouths nonstop, and drooling at the sight of her.<br>Practically all the discussion in and around the plaza were about Yin Zhuanghong.<br>It was not only the people of the younger generation; even those from the older generation stared at Yin Zhuanghong with lecherous gazes.<br>Their reactions were understandable. After all, they were all men.<br>No matter when, men would always be fond of youthful and beautiful women.<br>&ldquo;Could this girl really be waiting for me?&rdquo; Chu Feng felt surprised.<br>Yin Zhuanghong was not fond of sticking out.<br>With her cold personality, she was most definitely not fond of being at the center of the plaza; stared at and commented on by the crowd like a monkey in a zoo.<br>However, she stood there completely motionless. It seemed like she was deliberately standing at the most obvious location, waiting for someone.<br>That said, a lot of people had gathered around her.<br>Amongst them were Meng Rufei and his master, Zhang Duotuo.<br>&ldquo;Miss Yin, we should be leaving,&rdquo; Zhang Duotuo said all of a sudden.<br>&ldquo;Senior, let&rsquo;s wait a bit longer,&rdquo; said Yin Zhuanghong.<br>Compared to when she spoke to others, Yin Zhuanghong showed some respect towards Zhang Duotuo.<br>&ldquo;Who are you waiting for? Are you waiting for Grandmaster Yuan Shu?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already told you, if Grandmaster Yuan Shu doesn&rsquo;t wish to see you, it&rsquo;s useless no matter how long you wait for him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how stubborn a person Grandmaster Yuan Shu is,&rdquo; said Zhang Duotuo.<br>&ldquo;Senior, I know. That&rsquo;s why I am not waiting for Grandmaster Yuan Shu,&rdquo; said Yin Zhuanghong.<br>&ldquo;Then who are you waiting for?&rdquo; Meng Rufei rushed to ask. There was a trace of nervousness in his eyes as he said those words. He was very worried about who Yin Zhuanghong was waiting for.<br>However, Yin Zhuanghong did not answer him.<br>Seeing that, Zhang Duotuo also asked, &ldquo;Miss Yin, who are you waiting for?&rdquo;<br>Yet, Yin Zhuanghong still did not answer.<br>It was not only Meng Rufei and Zhang Duotuo who were curious. At that moment, everyone present wanted to know who Yin Zhuanghong was waiting for.<br>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s waiting for me.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a voice was heard and Chu Feng walked out of the crowd.<br>&ldquo;Asura?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Lord Asura!&rdquo;<br>That plaza was the plaza where the World Spirit Mansion Gate was opened. A lot of people were gathered here.<br>Thus, many people recognized Chu Feng. They all knew that he was the younger generation's Saint-cloak World Spiritist.<br>Because of that, a commotion was immediately raised by his appearance. The already spiritedly-discussing crowd started to discuss even more passionately.<br>&ldquo;Asura?&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing Chu Feng, the expressions of Meng Rufei and Zhang Duotuo turned ugly.<br>&ldquo;Miss Yin, you&rsquo;re really waiting for him?&rdquo; asked Meng Rufei.<br>Yin Zhuanghong did not answer him. Instead, she said to Chu Feng, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re late.&rdquo;<br>Hearing her words, Meng Rufei&rsquo;s complexion immediately turned ashen. He took two steps back and nearly fell.<br>He was furious...<br>Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s words had confirmed that the person she had been waiting for was indeed Chu Feng.<br>However, that was not what was important. What&rsquo;s important was that Yin Zhuanghong was actually smiling as she said those words.<br>It seemed as if being able to see Chu Feng was a very joyous thing for her.<br>That was a treatment that Meng Rufei had never once received from her.<br></p></div>
