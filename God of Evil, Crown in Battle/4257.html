        <h1>Chapter 4256</h1>
        <div> - Being Humiliated<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re injured because of your own uselessness; what does that have to do with us?&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen&rsquo;s words were extremely mocking.<br>Furthermore, after he said those words, laughters sounded from the vast crowd that filled both the sky and ground.<br>They were all mocking Chu Feng.<br>Hearing those words and those laughters, Chu Feng realized that something was amiss.<br>He had clearly saved the crowd. Why would they be responding to him with such an attitude?<br>Could it be that his contribution has been stolen?<br>Thinking of this, Chu Feng looked over to Lu Jie.<br>Seeing how Lu Jie was looking at him so complacently and with contempt, Chu Feng realized that he had guessed correctly.<br>This Lu Jie had stolen the credit to his meritorious service.<br>&ldquo;Lu Jie, why bother showing off what you didn&rsquo;t accomplish?&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Lu Jie.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you acting a sore loser here?&rdquo; refuted Lu Jie.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you couldn&rsquo;t possibly be planning to say that you were the one who freed us, right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Did you really think that you&rsquo;ve saved us just because you walked out from that chessboard?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Did you really consider yourself to be our savior?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ridiculous. Truly ridiculous.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hahahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Laughters and mocking words aimed at Chu Feng sounded nonstop.<br>Those people were all standing on Lu Jie&rsquo;s side.<br>They firmly believed that it was Lu Jie that saved them and Chu Feng was nothing more than a clown.<br>&ldquo;All of you, shut up!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng fought for us! How are you all qualified to insult him?!&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen exploded with rage and unleashed his oppressive might. He was planning to suppress the crowd.<br>&ldquo;Buzz---&rdquo;<br>But, Grandmaster Tang Chen&rsquo;s oppressive might was immediately blocked by two equally powerful oppressive mights.<br>It was not only the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted that took on Grandmaster Tang Chen this time around. There was also Grandmaster Luo Tuo.<br>Both of them blocked Grandmaster Tang Chen&rsquo;s oppressive might with their own at the same time.<br>At this moment, Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted who had kept quiet the entire time spoke, &ldquo;Tang Chen, while it is true that we&rsquo;ve chosen Chu Feng, he could very well refuse to enter the chessboard.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;While it is our decision to choose him to fight for us, it is his decision to enter the chessboard.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He had decided to enter the chessboard not for our sake but rather for his own sake.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He had his own selfishness and wanted to live. That is no issue at all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, when he entered the chessboard, our lives ended up being in his hands too. He cannot blame anyone for being injured by his own recklessness. But, that recklessness brought us suffering too. That is not something that should&rsquo;ve happened.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for young hero Lu Jie breaching the other chess formation, we might&rsquo;ve been killed by that Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There is nothing wrong with us cursing out someone who nearly killed us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, he even wanted to steal young hero Lu Jie&rsquo;s contribution. Are we not supposed to curse out someone as despicable and shameless like him?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Must we tolerate his behavior just because he possesses good talent?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What sort of logic is that?&rdquo;<br>The Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted said those words very loudly. Not to mention the people in the vicinity of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain, even those far away would be able to hear his voice.<br>&ldquo;What Lord Heavenly Exalted said is extremely true.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right, no matter how talented, if his character is despicable, then he&rsquo;s still useless.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Someone like him will become a scourge sooner or later.&rdquo;<br>What brought upon the most anger toward Grandmaster Tang Chen, Yuan Shu and Yu Ting was the fact that Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s words received many people&rsquo;s support.<br>At this moment, the voices that filled the sky were no longer only aimed at Chu Feng. They were also attacking Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>Chu Feng had clearly fought for the crowd. Yet, he became the target of scorn.<br>This was truly infuriating.<br>But, compared to Grandmaster Tang Chen and others, Chu Feng shook his head indifferently.<br>He seemed to not care about this sort of thing.<br>But, while Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t care about it, Grandmaster Tang Chen was unable to not care about it.<br>&ldquo;You bunch of ingrates! I, Tang Chen, am definitely going to teach you all a lesson today!&rdquo;<br>In a violent rage, Grandmaster Tang Chen actually took out his weapon. He was really planning to fight the crowd.<br>Even though he knew he wouldn&rsquo;t be a match for all these people, he was still determined to bring justice to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Humph. Tang Chen, I knew you were accomplice with that Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;While we don&rsquo;t blame you for shielding him, but we are not afraid of you if you think you can threaten us.&rdquo;<br>Facing the enraged Grandmaster Tang Chen, Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted and Grandmaster Luo Tuo also took out their weapons. They were actually really planning to fight Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;Senior, forget about it.&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, a voice was heard. It was Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Senior, you don&rsquo;t have to bicker with them about something like this.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I, Chu Feng, had not stepped into the chessboard for the safety of those people to begin with.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I did that for the sake of you all, people that I care about.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Seeing that you all are fine, I, Chu Feng, feel that everything I did was worth it.&rdquo;<br>There was a faint smile on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face as he said those words.<br>That smile does not seem like a disguise. He was truly not affected by those people&rsquo;s malicious words.<br>&ldquo;Master, you should let it pass. If something is to happen to you, who would protect brother Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>Yuan Shu was also trying to dissuade his master through voice transmission.<br>Even though he knew his master possess great abilities, his master was most definitely going to suffer losses against Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted and Grandmaster Luo Tuo, two people on par with his master.<br>While Grandmaster Tang Chen was raging with anger, he thought about what Yuan Shu said and felt it to be reasonable too.<br>He was not here alone.<br>He also needed to protect Yuan Shu, Yu Ting and Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng had already made an enemy out of Lu Jie. If something is to happen to him, Lu Jie and his senior brothers and sisters will definitely not spare Chu Feng.<br>Although he was feeling very unwilling, Grandmaster Tang Chen placed away his weapon after weighting the pros and cons.<br>Neither Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted or Grandmaster Luo Tuo pressed on for a fight after seeing Grandmaster Tang Chen placing away his weapon.<br>With smiles of victory on their faces, they placed away their weapons too.<br>In the end, neither one of them wanted to fight Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;Amazing.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re actually unaffected even with all those people cursing you out.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, your skin is truly tough.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a mocking voice sounded.<br>That voice came from Lu Jie.<br>&ldquo;Lu Jie, you yourself knew what exactly is going on.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In terms of skin being tough, I couldn&rsquo;t possibly compare to you,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I&rsquo;d urge you to watch the way you speak to me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right now, if I decide to attack you, no one will be able to help you.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Lu Jie&rsquo;s gaze turned gloomy.<br>Seeing this, Grandmaster Tang Chen and others&rsquo; hearts sank. They realized the situation was bad.<br>Lu Jie&rsquo;s senior brothers and sisters had tried to kill Chu Feng after Lu Jie was defeated by Chu Feng.<br>Fortunately Grandmaster Tang Chen was there to protect Chu Feng. Else, Chu Feng might already be dead.<br>But now, the crowd was blocked outside the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain.<br>Only Chu Feng and Lu Jie were inside.<br>If Lu Jie decided to attack Chu Feng now, there would simply be no one that could help Chu Feng.<br></p></div>
