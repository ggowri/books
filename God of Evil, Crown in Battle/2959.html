        <div> - Most Definitely Not An Abnormal Sign<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;That said, will he be able to ascend to the legendary tenth step?&rdquo;<br>At the same time that they were astonished, the crowd also discovered that Chu Feng&rsquo;s face was completely covered with a painful expression.<br>A sign of being unable to withstand the pain finally appeared on his face.<br>Chu Feng had only managed to put a single foot on the tenth step. This could not be considered as having ascended to the tenth step at all. Only by having both feet on the tenth step would it be considered a success.<br>However, as the crowd saw the difficult expression on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face, they felt that it would be very difficult for Chu Feng to succeed.<br>It reality, Chu Feng was indeed nearly at his limit. When Chu Feng&rsquo;s foot landed on the tenth step, he felt as if his entire soul was being ripped apart by the lightning. That sort of pain was truly unbearable.<br>However, Chu Feng was feeling overjoyed.<br>&ldquo;Lord Father, you actually deceived me!&rdquo; Chu Feng exclaimed in his heart.<br>Only Her Lady Queen was able to hear what he said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what are you talking about? How did your father deceive you?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen asked.<br>&ldquo;Eggy, this Heavenly Lightning Steps is different from the one that my father prepared for me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, they&rsquo;re different. However, I do not understand why you said that your father deceived you,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible for two Heavenly Lightning Steps to be different. So because it&rsquo;s different, that means there&rsquo;s an issue with one of the Heavenly Lightning Steps.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I am currently in the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s territory. All the people of the Chu Heavenly Clan would have to ascend this Heavenly Lightning Steps when they reach adulthood. Thus, the people of the Chu Heavenly Clan should know the Heavenly Lightning Steps better than anyone else.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, this Heavenly Lightning Steps should not have any issues. If this Heavenly Lightning Steps has no issues, that means that the Heavenly Lightning Steps my father had me ascend is the one with an issue,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re saying that your father altered that Heavenly Lightning Steps and increased its power?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen asked.<br>&ldquo;I feel that to most likely be the case,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, it would mean that you&rsquo;d actually already successfully ascended to the ninth step back in the Heavenly Road?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Haha, so that&rsquo;s the case. No wonder your father was so happy after you ascended to the eighth step. It turns out that the eighth step was the ninth step, and the ninth step that you failed to ascend was actually the Heavenly Lightning Steps&rsquo; tenth step.&rdquo;<br>Her Lady Queen went wild with joy. After all, this proved that Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent was not inferior to his father&rsquo;s and grandfather&rsquo;s.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, likely neither your father nor your grandfather ever ascended to the tenth step before. If you&rsquo;re capable of standing on it fully, wouldn&rsquo;t that mean that your talent surpasses your father&rsquo;s and grandfather&rsquo;s?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>&ldquo;I do not wish to surpass my father and grandfather. However, I, as an exiled child, am urgent to prove myself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Back then, I was deemed to have no talent for martial cultivation, and was branded as trash on my forehead. I was driven out of my clan when I was only an infant.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today, I, Chu Feng, have finally returned to the Chu Heavenly Clan. I must prove myself. I am not trying to prove myself to be stronger than anyone. Rather, I want them to know that they misjudged me. I want them to know that I, Chu Feng, am not someone with no talent for martial cultivation, that I am not a disgrace to Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s name, not a disgrace to Chu Hanxian&rsquo;s name, that I, Chu Feng, did not ruin my father and grandfather&rsquo;s reputation.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng clenched his teeth and lifted his other foot.<br>&ldquo;Step~~~&rdquo;<br>Lightning exploded from the Heavenly Lightning Steps&rsquo; tenth step. Chu Feng was standing on the tenth step with both feet.<br>Chu Feng had managed to ascend to the legendary tenth step that no one had been ever able to reach.<br>&ldquo;He&hellip; really managed to do it?!&rdquo;<br>The crowd simply did not dare to believe what they were seeing. Not only did Chu Feng awaken the legendary tenth step, but he even managed to successfully reach it.<br>At that moment, it was not only the people present that did not dare to believe their eyes, even that Supreme Elder Chu Hanpeng located deep in the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s main city had a very complicated expression in his eyes.<br>That Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s second strongest expert was actually somewhat incapable of remaining calm.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a loud explosion sounded from deep within the sky.<br>The next moment, nine-colored lightning appeared high in the sky.<br>The lightning spiraled around like a vortex before it gathered together.<br>&ldquo;What&hellip; what is that?!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, it was not only the people of the younger generation that were frightened; even the experts from the older generation became somewhat panicked.<br>As people of the Chu Heavenly Clan, Nine-colored Divine Lightning was a common sight to them. However, the Nine-colored Divine Lightning that appeared in the sky at that moment gave them a sensation that they&rsquo;d never felt before.<br>It was a truly devastating power. If the Nine-colored Divine Lightning in the sky were to strike down, it would definitely be fatal. It would not only be Chu Feng that ended up suffering from it, but everyone present would suffer too.<br>&ldquo;That Divine Lightning is not just an abnormal sign. Everyone, scatter immediately, return to the main city!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, someone shouted. The next moment, everyone from the Chu Heavenly Clan started to fly toward the main city.<br>Seeing that the situation was bad, Chu Xuanzhengfa shouted, &ldquo;Chu Feng, get down immediately!&rdquo;<br>However, when the Nine-colored Divine Lightning appeared in the sky, the Heavenly Lightning Steps&rsquo; lightning also became abnormally fierce. Chu Feng was completely covered by lightning. One could only faintly see his silhouette, and not know his situation.<br>This caused Chu Xuanzhengfa to feel even more worried.<br><br><br></p></div>
