        <h1>Chapter 1113</h1>
        <div> - Jealousy and Rivalry<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>Regardless of what sort of eyes the Three Cyanwood Forests and the Orion Monastery looked to the Ascension Sect with, in the eyes of the others, the Ascension Sect was still one of the five first-rate subsidiary powers. Even after the consecutive grand arrivals of the four other first-rate subsidiary powers, the arrival of the Ascension Sect brought about a great amount of attention.<br>Before the focused eyes of the crowd, the Ascension Sect&rsquo;s warships descended onto the plaza, and their disciples and elders all walked onto the strange. The Ascension Sect did not conceal their strength, and anyone on the stage with decent strength and possessing spirit energy would easily be able to determine their cultivation.<br>At this moment, the most focused people were naturally the four thousand plus disciples of the Ascension Sect. After all, the strength of these disciples were the true representatives of the strength of the Ascension Sect.<br>&ldquo;This year around, the Ascension Sect&rsquo;s display is pretty normal. Compared to previous years, there is not much difference between the number of disciples or the quality of those disciples they brought with them. This should normally be fine, but as they&rsquo;re also a first-rate subsidiary power, when compared with the other four, they appear to be relatively unpresentable.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. From this, doesn&rsquo;t it mean that the Ascension Sect has become the weakest among the five first-rate subsidiary powers now?&rdquo;<br>Upon inspecting the strength of the Ascension Sect&rsquo;s disciples, the crowd was unable to help themselves from comparing them with the disciples of the Three Cyanwood Forests and the Orion Monastery.<br>Although the overall quality of the disciples was more or less the same, it remained that the Three Cyanwood Forests and the Orion Monastery possessed Wang Yan, Jiang Hao, Huang Juan and Yuan Qing, four geniuses with a cultivation of rank three Martial King, and fame that spread through the entire Cyanwood Domain. Thus, when compared with them, the Ascension Sect appeared to be rather inferior.<br>&ldquo;Aouuu~~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right at this moment, the cry of a bird sounded on the horizon. An Ascension Bird descended from the sky. At this moment, a figure appeared before the crowd&rsquo;s eyes.<br>It was a woman. Her white dress fluttered in the wind, and her appearance was that of an absolute beauty; she appeared like a goddess. On top of that, she possessed the cultivation of rank three Martial King.<br>Her arrival immediately shifted the crowd&rsquo;s focus onto her. That was because she was truly too beautiful. Not only was she beautiful, she also appeared to be very young. Judging from her fair and tender skin, she was most definitely younger than twenty years of age.<br>With such a cultivation at such a young age, what did this mean? This meant that this girl possessed exceptional talent. Otherwise, how could she possibly obtain such a cultivation at that young of an age?<br>&ldquo;Who is this chick? How come I&rsquo;ve never heard about her before? The Ascension Sect has truly hidden her well.&rdquo; At this moment, even Wang Yan&rsquo;s eyes shone, and started to display a complicated expression.<br>Someone of Wang Yan&rsquo;s caliber was not a person who lacked the accompany of beauties. As for women that he would place in his eyes, they were very few and rare. However, Bai Ruochen was different from ordinary women. Her appearance could be said to be absolutely beautiful, with no flaws. Furthermore, she possessed a sort of icy air that repelled others to a thousand miles away.<br>When such an absolute beauty was fused with that sort of repelling icy air, it made Bai Ruochen appear like an otherworldly goddess that caused mortals to involuntarily become attracted to her.<br>In short, Bai Ruochen&rsquo;s appearance caused everyone to forget about Huang Juan. Compared to Huang Juan, who was covered with makeup and dressed like a prostitute, Bai Ruochen&rsquo;s natural beauty appeared even more precious. She was truly a deserving little beauty.<br>Thus, it was not only Wang Yan, practically all of the men present were charmed by her. Even the eyes of some elders, who had lived for several hundred years, started to shine as their heartbeats accelerated as if they were looking at their first love.<br>However, this was normal. After all, everyone possessed the heart to love beauty. This was not limited to only sexual reasons, it was also an appreciation of beauty.<br>&ldquo;Wang Yan, you are truly ill-informed. I actually knew that the Ascension Sect had hidden such a little beauty beforehand.&rdquo; At this moment, Jiang Hao spoke.<br>&ldquo;Senior brother Jiang, may I know who exactly this woman is?&rdquo; Hearing those words, Yuan Qing was unable to contain himself and spoke to ask.<br>&ldquo;Heh, junior brother Yuan Qing, might it be that you&rsquo;re interested in this woman?&rdquo; Hearing that question, Jiang Hao mocked with a mischievous smile.<br>&ldquo;Everyone possesses the heart to love beauty. A woman like her is rare in this world. Could it be that senior brothers, the two of you are not tempted by her?&rdquo; Yuan Qing smiled lightly. Not only did he not deny it, he instead declared that he had been charmed by Bai Ruochen.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha&hellip; Sure enough, it is men who understand other men.&rdquo; Both Jiang Hao and Wang Yan started laughing. They also indirectly admitted to Yuan Qing&rsquo;s speculation.<br>The four powers&rsquo; elders and headmasters had also heard their conversation. However, no one said anything about it. That was because the three of them were all going to become the Cyanwood Mountain&rsquo;s disciples. Furthermore, their future accomplishments were going to be boundless. Who knows when they might actually surpass themselves. Thus, at this moment, none of the headmasters reprimanded them using their identity of headmasters.<br>&ldquo;Che, Wang Yan, Jiang Hao, didn&rsquo;t the two of you declare that you would not be tempted by ten thousand flowers? [1. Flowers in this case meant women.] How come the two of you are enchanted by a little girl from the Ascension Sect today?&rdquo;<br>At this moment, Huang Juan was unable to continue watching this going on anymore. She was also a woman, yet she did not create such a commotion that Bai Ruochen created. Thus, it was inevitable that she grew a bit envious of Bai Ruochen.<br>&ldquo;Sigh, Huang Juan, this is something that you don&rsquo;t understand. Do you know what the name of this girl from the Ascension Sect is? Do you know what her identity is?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let me tell you, her name is Bai Ruochen. She is just eighteen years old this year, a total of ten years younger than you. Yet, this Bai Ruochen is the eldest senior sister of the Ascension Sect&rsquo;s disciples.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do you know how she&rsquo;s the eldest senior sister? Other than possessing a tyrannical cultivation, it is said that her battle power is also extraordinary. Moreover, she has an amazing mother, the mysterious madam that the Ascension Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster married two years ago,&rdquo; said Jiang Hao.<br>&ldquo;Oh? So this girl is actually that madam&rsquo;s daughter? No wonder&hellip;&rdquo; Hearing Jiang Hao&rsquo;s explanation, Wang Yan and Yuan Qing became even more interested in Bai Ruochen.<br>All of them had heard of the rumors regarding Bai Ruochen&rsquo;s mother. They knew that her mother was a very powerful and mysterious woman. Even to this date, no one know about her mother&rsquo;s name or where she had come from.<br>However, it remained that she was undoubtedly powerful. That was because the Ascension Sect had only started becoming stronger after the arrival of Bai Ruochen&rsquo;s mother. Essentially, Bai Ruochen&rsquo;s mother was a mystery that people discussed enthusiastically about. At the same time, she also brought about restraining fear.<br>&ldquo;Enough of your rubbish. How come I have never heard that the Ascension Sect&rsquo;s Madam Sectmaster had a daughter?&rdquo; Huang Juan curled her lips. She did not believe Jiang Hao.<br>&ldquo;This is something that I heard from a friend of mine in the Ascension Sect. The information is absolutely true. If you do not believe me, we can make a bet. Do you dare?&rdquo; said Jiang Hao with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;No one&rsquo;s going to bother with your nonsense.&rdquo; Huang Juan cast a side eye at Jiang Hao. She stopped paying attention to him. However, the gaze with which she looked at Bai Ruochen became somewhat hostile as if she had seen an enemy.<br>&ldquo;Heh, no matter what, I am truly fond of this Bai Ruochen. I am definitely taking this girl for myself.&rdquo; At this moment, Yuan Qing said those words confidently.<br>&ldquo;Yoh, junior brother Yuan Qing, you&rsquo;re actually that confident?&rdquo; Seeing this, Wang Yan smiled indifferently. There seemed to be a hidden intention behind his words. At the same time, the same sort of smile appeared on Jiang Hao&rsquo;s face.<br></p></div>
