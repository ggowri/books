        <h1>Chapter 3508</h1>
        <div> - Slight Displeasure<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Senior, before leaving, this Chu Feng wishes to say something.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although I am not sure if senior will believe me, I still think that I must say it,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; The Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief revealed a curious look. He said, &ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, there's no harm in speaking your mind.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, please tell me the truth. Are you unable to kill that Black-feathered Specter using the power of the grand demon suppression formation?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;......&rdquo;<br>Once Chu Feng said those words, the expressions of the great majority of the people present changed.<br>Even though the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief did not show any change in his outward expression, he was feeling shocked in his heart.<br>He had thought that he had managed to deceive Chu Feng. Never did he expect that Chu Feng actually managed to see through everything.<br>The Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had actually wanted to say something and continue to deceive Chu Feng. However, before he could say anything, Chu Feng said, &ldquo;Senior, if you&rsquo;re unable to kill it, I&rsquo;d advise senior to not be too excessive toward it, and to not insult it. Otherwise, if it manages to break free from the spirit formation, I fear that your Tantai Heavenly Clan will be met with a great catastrophe,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, why do you think that way? That monster has already been suppressed by the grand demon suppression formation. You&rsquo;ve also managed to see that its power has already weakened. That is the power of the grand formation. If I had wanted to kill it, I could do so at any time. The reason why I am not killing it is because I want to find out about young lady Liluo&rsquo;s situation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although it's very possible that young lady Liluo has encountered a mishap, even if she has died, I still wish to provide young friend Chu Feng with a clear result, and not keep you in the dark,&rdquo; the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief revealed a slightly angry look on his face. It was as if Chu Feng had truly blamed him wrongly.<br>&ldquo;In that case, it&rsquo;s possible that this junior is overthinking things. Senior, please don&rsquo;t blame me for it. It&rsquo;s just that this junior keeps feeling that the voices emitted by that Black-feathered Specter, regardless of whether it be the screams it let out before it was captured or the low growls after it was captured, did not seem to be anguished wailings, but rather laughter.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That sort of laughter is very dangerous. Before, this junior had been unable to understand why it would laugh like that.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, just then, I suddenly thought of a possibility, a very terrifying possibility. Perhaps that Black-feathered Specter is not suppressed by the grand demon suppression formation. Instead, everything is under the Black-feathered Specter&rsquo;s control,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Hearing those words, the elders of the Tantai Heavenly Clan all began to look unwell.<br>&ldquo;Impossible. Young friend Chu Feng, that guess of yours is too absurd.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why would that Black-feathered Specter do something like deliberately allowing itself to be suppressed by the grand demon suppression formation, deliberately tormenting itself and weakening its strength? What benefit would it gain?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is simply unexplainable.&rdquo;<br>However, they soon rejected Chu Feng&rsquo;s proposal. They did not believe him at all.<br>Furthermore, they even became very unhappy, and felt that Chu Feng was spouting rubbish.<br>&ldquo;There is no need for seniors to tell me that. I too felt my suspicion to be very absurd. That is why I said at the very start that you all might not believe me should I mention what&rsquo;s on my mind. However&hellip; I feel that it is necessary for me to tell you all this. As for whether or not you all will believe me, it is your decision.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, thank you for your hospitality, and thank you for your gifts. Junior Chu Feng will take his leave now.&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he clasped his fist respectfully toward the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. Then, he turned around and left.<br>Perhaps because Chu Feng had mentioned what the Tantai Heavenly Clan was unwilling to say, the Tantai Heavenly Clansmen became unhappy, and did not continue to see Chu Feng off.<br>Instead, it was Wuming Xingyun who went after Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you forgot your manners earlier. If it was merely a guess of yours, you should not have mentioned it. This is especially true in regards to your earlier words; they were not something that they wished to hear.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not only did you question their honesty, but you even brought unease upon the hearts of the Tantai Heavenly Clansmen,&rdquo; Wuming Xingyun said.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, I made them unhappy by questioning them. However, since I am questioning something that is true, there's no reason for me to feel guilty.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for inciting chaos in their hearts, that wouldn&rsquo;t happen. After all, they simply do not believe in my guess at all,&rdquo; Chu Feng laughed.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, why did you request to see the Black-feathered Specter again? Could it be&hellip; you&rsquo;ve truly discovered something?&rdquo; Wuming Xingyun realized that the situation was amiss. After all, Chu Feng&rsquo;s attitude only changed after seeing the Black-feathered Specter again.<br>Chu Feng laughed. He did not speak directly. Instead, he replied through voice transmission, &ldquo;Earlier, I went to verify one thing. And now, I&rsquo;ve gotten my answer.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What did you verify?&rdquo; Wuming Xingyun asked using voice transmission.<br>&ldquo;My big sister Liluo is indeed inside the Black-feathered Specter&rsquo;s body. The feeling that I had was indeed transmitted by her. She is trying to tell me to calm down.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After I discovered that, I was able to link up with her in a simple manner following the feeling that she transmitted to me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of that, I&rsquo;ve learned some terrifying things,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What are they?&rdquo; At that moment, Wuming Xingyun&rsquo;s eyes were filled with shock.<br>He had been observing the Black-feathered Specter the entire time too. Yet, he did not discover anything.<br>&ldquo;The Black-feathered Specter is deliberately allowing itself to be suppressed by the grand demon suppression formation,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Ah? Why would the Black-feathered Specter do that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why would young lady Liluo be inside the Black-feathered Specter&rsquo;s body? Exactly what is that Black-feathered Specter trying to do?&rdquo; Questions filled Wuming Xingyun&rsquo;s heart.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know either. Perhaps because of the Black-feathered Specter&rsquo;s interference, I am only able to communicate with my big sister Liluo in a simple manner. That is all I&rsquo;ve learned. However, one thing is certain - my big sister Liluo is very safe,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Thus, young friend Chu Feng, what you&rsquo;ve told the Tantai Heavenly Clan earlier was not a guess, but rather the truth?&rdquo; asked Wuming Xingyun.<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell it as it is then?&rdquo; Wuming Xingyun asked.<br>&ldquo;Even if I told it as it is, would they have believed me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked in return.<br>&ldquo;No, they wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Wuming Xingyun shook his head.<br>Although Wuming Xingyun felt very helpless to say so, that was the truth. The Tantai Heavenly Clan would not have believed Chu Feng&rsquo;s words.<br>&ldquo;Actually, I also have a selfish motive in why I did not tell them as it is, and try to warn them in a direct manner,&rdquo; Chu Feng suddenly added.<br>&ldquo;Mn?&rdquo; Hearing those words, Wuming Xingyun looked to Chu Feng again. Curiosity appeared in his eyes.<br>Chu Feng laughed, &ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s because they simply do not plan to save my big sister Liluo, and knew that they were unable to kill that Black-feathered Specter, yet decided to deceive me like that. Because of that, I am feeling, to a greater or lesser degree, displeased.&rdquo;<br></p></div>
