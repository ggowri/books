        <h1>Chapter 5739: The Greatest Dark Horse</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Qin Shu flitted onto the dueling ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Qin Shu? What&rsquo;s he doing?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Qin Shu was a prodigy too, but he was lacking compared to Qin Xuan. There was no way he could deal with Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span>, especially when she had revealed her rank five Half-God level cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Qin Shu revealed his cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Rank five Half-God level? No wonder!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Qin Shu was ranked in the tenth place of those who had taken the test, but it was important to note that those who were ranked higher than him were renowned prodigies such as Jie </span><span>Baobao</span><span>, Ling Xiao, and </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span>. In that sense, his ranking carried a lot of weight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And his rank five Half-God level cultivation proved that he was the real deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Qin Shu&rsquo;s aura quickly changed, as his aura rose to rank six Half-God level, followed by rank seven Half-God level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;A rank five Half-God level cultivator who&rsquo;s able to raise his cultivation by two ranks. If not for Qin Xuan, Qin Shu would have been the strongest junior in the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who didn&rsquo;t know Qin Shu well were impressed by his strength, though Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span> continued looking at him as if he was a fool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Qin Shu was unaware of that and continued smiling gleefully. He took two steps forward and bowed, saying, &ldquo;I, Qin Shu, am here to try your skills, young miss. However, a simple duel is boring. Why don&rsquo;t we make a bet?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What bet?&rdquo; Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span> asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll marry me if I win,&rdquo; Qin Shu said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What if you lose?&rdquo; Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span> asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A shameless smile appeared on Qin Shu&rsquo;s face as he replied, &ldquo;If I lose, I&rsquo;ll marry </span><span>you.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those words spurred laughter from the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect members. This clearly wasn&rsquo;t a bet at all; Qin Shu was just teasing Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span>. He would have never dared to do so if it wasn&rsquo;t Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span> but </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frankly speaking, Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span> was indeed formidable, but the others still took her lightly just because she was from the Nine Souls Galaxy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t young anymore. You should know that you have to take responsibility for your words, right?&rdquo; Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span> asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Rest assured, young miss. I, Qin Shu, intend on taking responsibility for you,&rdquo; Qin Shu licked his lips as he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uwa</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Qin Shu suddenly let out a sharp cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span> had unknowingly appeared in front of Qin Shu and smashed her leg into his abdomen, causing his face to warp in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kick sent him flying to the corner of the dueling ring, but Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span> instantaneously caught up with him. She whipped out a green dagger and brandished it toward Qin Shu&rsquo;s mouth, intending to silence him for good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right before the dagger landed on Qin Shu, a sword suddenly appeared out of nowhere and deflected it. It happened so quickly that it took a while for the crowd to register the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Qin Shu lay on the floor, groaning in pain. Standing in front of him was a man holding a sword. He was the one who had deflected Xian </span><span>Miaomiao&rsquo;s</span><span> dagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first detail the crowd noticed was that Xian </span><span>Miaomiao&rsquo;s</span><span> aura was vastly different from before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span> is able to raise her cultivation by three ranks at Half-God level? Is she really from the Nine Souls Galaxy?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd couldn&rsquo;t remain calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Qin Shu was unable to retaliate despite having raised his cultivation to rank seven Half-God level because Xian </span><span>Miaomiao&rsquo;s</span><span> current cultivation level was rank eight Half-God.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Please calm down, young miss,&rdquo; the man who deflected Xian </span><span>Miaomiao&rsquo;s</span><span> dagger said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shared similar facial features as Qin Shu, but his gentle disposition and simple clothes made him look like a scholar. There was not a hint of disrespect when he looked at Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span>. Rather, he seemed apologetic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the discussions of the crowd, Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span> learned that the man was Qin Xuan, the strongest prodigy of the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Qin Xuan was wrapped in two layers of auras, one stronger than the other. His cultivation level had been raised to rank eight Half-God, but his base cultivation level was rank six Half-God.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span> knew that a prodigy of his caliber was most likely able to raise his cultivation level by more than two ranks, which meant that there was nothing she could do if he insisted on protecting Qin Shu.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she retracted her dagger and stepped down from the dueling ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Qin Xuan dragged Qin Shu up from the ground and said, &ldquo;Apologize to the young miss.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Big brother, she hit me&hellip;&rdquo; Qin Shu was reluctant to do as he was told.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Qin Xuan looked at him sternly and said, &ldquo;Apologize.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Qin Xuan&rsquo;s gentle demeanor, Qin Shu immediately gave in as soon as he displayed signs of anger. Qin Shu quickly bowed to Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span> and said, &ldquo;Miss Xian, I was wrong. Please forgive me.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span> ignored him. She walked into the fog and returned to her residence, not paying no heed to Qin Shu at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her temper changed the crowd&rsquo;s opinion of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Qin Shu staggered down from the dueling ring under Qin Xuan's support. He wiped off the blood on the corner of his lips and murmured, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a proud one. I didn&rsquo;t expect her to be so strong. She&rsquo;ll definitely become famous after the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith. It&rsquo;d be great if I could take her in as my concubine.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Qin Xuan coldly eyed Qin Shu. &ldquo;There are many people here you can&rsquo;t mess with. Rein it in, or else I might not be able to clean up your mess.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity Chu Feng is dead, or else I would have taught him a lesson,&rdquo; Qin Shu said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t dare to come here even if he&rsquo;s alive. Even if I don&rsquo;t make a move, those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion wouldn&rsquo;t let him off the hook either,&rdquo; Qin Shu said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Putting aside Jie </span><span>Baobao</span><span> and Ling Xiao, I didn&rsquo;t expect the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion to be concealing that monster, Jie Tian. I reckon Jie Tian will be the trickiest opponent for you other than </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span>.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrogant Qin Shu dared not to make light of Jie Tian. Qin Xuan also showed a hint of stress upon the mention of Jie Tian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one dared not make light of Jie Tian even though no one had met him yet, for the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion had announced Jie Tian&rsquo;s identity right before the opening of the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jie Tian was Jie </span><span>Mubai</span><span> and Jie </span><span>Tiannian&rsquo;s</span><span> son, and he had inherited the Ruler&rsquo;s Bloodline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng&rsquo;s background and talent were shocking, but most people harbored doubts about him as the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion refused to acknowledge him. On the other hand, Jie Tian had received the best resources from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion from a young age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span> was the prodigy most likely to clinch first place in the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith, Jie Tian would be the biggest dark horse of the event.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weng!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the teleportation formation in the square lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s coming in at this time? The test is about to be over, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd knew that those who had cleared the test would enter the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith through the teleportation formation, having been through it themselves. They were shocked when they saw who appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s him?&rdquo;</span></p></div>
