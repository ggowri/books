        <h1>Chapter 676</h1>
        <div> - Entering the Immortal Realm<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Waa, Brother Wuqing, you&rsquo;re truly not a simple person! You even know this Ya Fei?&rdquo; After Ya Fei walked away, Wang Long came close with his face full of all sorts of admiration.<br>Because Ya Fei had always worn a smile on her face and her gaze was quite soft, from her appearance, she looked as if she were talking to an old friend. One could simply not see her hatred towards Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Hoh...&rdquo; Chu Feng only smiled lightly but did not reply when he heard Wong Long&rsquo;s question. He felt that even though Wang Long had decent cultivation, he clearly didn&rsquo;t have enough intelligence. Chu Feng &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t speaking the same language&rdquo; as him.<br>&ldquo;Junior Wuqing, there seems to be some sort of conflict between you and Ya Fei?&rdquo; As expected, people like Xia Yu, who had meticulous hearts, instantly saw the strife between Chu Feng and Ya Fei. She hiddenly sent a mental message asking him about it, and at the same time, Chun Wu and the others were doing the same.<br>&ldquo;There were indeed some small incidents, but it&rsquo;s not worth mentioning.&rdquo; Of course, Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t tell Xia Yu and the others about the matter because he didn&rsquo;t completely trust them.<br>&ldquo;Junior Wuqing, regardless of anything, just follow us into the Martial Marking Immortal Realm and everything will be fine. With us here, no matter who it is they won&rsquo;t dare to do anything to you. This is the territory of the Misty Peak, after all.&rdquo; Chun Wu, too, sent a mental message.<br>*rumble rumble rumble*<br>Just at that moment, rumbling sounds suddenly came from the center of the square. The entire mountain peak started to intensely shake. In that situation, everyone could see clearly a shining silhouette appearing from the square, gradually rising and ultimately becoming a solid gate.<br>The gate was a hundred meters tall with radiance pouring everywhere. It was grandiose, mighty, and incomparably domineering. Moreover, at that moment, the gate was slowly opening. Strands of colourful and peculiar mist akin to celestial air swirled around the gate as it came out.<br>And through the colourful mist, everyone could see, within the gate, mist lingering about, peaks that could touch the sky, ranks of cranes flying, waterfalls cascading.&hellip; It was not only a stand-alone world, it seemed more like a realm for immortals.<br>&ldquo;The Martial Marking Immortal Realm is the Holy Land of Martialism! I&rsquo;ve waited for so many years, and finally, I have the chance to enter this cultivation holy land! Wahahaha...&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, insane laughter rang out. An old woman flew up from a mountain peak, and arrived in the center of the square. Looking at her clothing, everyone could recognize her to be one of the guardians of the Misty Peak.<br>&ldquo;What is she saying? How can the Martial Marking Immortal Realm be the Holy Land of Martialism?&rdquo; Hearing that person&rsquo;s words, discussions arose and everyone was feeling disbelief.<br>Just then, however, that person did an action that went beyond any person&rsquo;s imagination. As she yelled, &ldquo;Holy Land of Martialism, here I come!&rdquo;, she flew up and directly into the opened gate.<br>*boom*<br>But just as she touched the colourful mist, with a<br>boom,<br>a loud sound rang out. That person actually exploded there and then, becoming a mist of blood, which dissipated within everyone&rsquo;s line of sight.<br>&ldquo;Heavens! What&rsquo;s with that person? Was she looking to die? Only those under the age of thirty can enter the Martial Marking Immortal Realm, or else they would explode and die!&rdquo; Seeing that, they were even more shocked and felt that simply, that person was ill.<br>&ldquo;Ahh, another one who doesn&rsquo;t want their life.&rdquo; At that instant, Xia Yu helplessly shook her head.<br>&ldquo;Senior Xia Yu, what happened? Wasn&rsquo;t that a person from the Misty Peak? She should know that she couldn&rsquo;t enter the Martial Marking Immortal Realm. Why did she still do such a mad act?&rdquo; Chu Feng curiously asked.<br>&ldquo;Honestly speaking, some people think that the<br>Martial Marking Immortal Realm<br>is the entrance to the Holy Land of Martialism. So, there are always people thinking of ways to enter the Misty Peak, and when then Martial Marking Immortal Realm opens, they, with no regards for their life, charge straight into it,&rdquo; Xia Yu explained.<br>&ldquo;So that means from the start, you knew she was going to die. Why didn&rsquo;t you stop her?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked again in confusion. Even though the old woman was strong, she was only a rank three Martial Lord. However, Xia Yu was a rank four Martial Lord. If she stopped her at the start, the old woman wouldn&rsquo;t have died.<br>&ldquo;Every time tragic events such as these happen, there is no way to stop it because some people have already cultivated to an insane stage. They only feel that their own estimations are correct. No matter what others say, they don&rsquo;t believe it. I&rsquo;m afraid even if they die, they would still be thinking that the Martial Marking Immortal Realm is truly the entrance to the Holy Land of Martialism.<br>&ldquo;So instead of stopping them, it&rsquo;d be better to just let them die. That way, at least their death can warn those in the future. Otherwise, those who enter the Misty Peak with other goals will not be forgiven by my master even if they don&rsquo;t die,&rdquo; Xia Yu explained.<br>Only upon hearing those words did Chu Feng understand what Xia Yu meant. Perhaps Lady Piaomiao, judging by her nature, would truly not easily forgive who came to the Misty Peak with malicious goals. So, Chu Feng understood why Xia Yu and the others didn&rsquo;t stop her.<br>&ldquo;Children from the Eastern Sea Region. The gate to the Martial Marking Immortal Realm has been opened. Are you prepared?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a soft voice filled with strong might rang out. Looking towards the origin of the voice, one could see a person appearing silently on top of the Martial Marking Immortal Realm&rsquo;s gate. That person was Lady Piaomiao.<br>*whoosh* After Lady Piaomiao appeared, she waved her sleeve. A hundred strands of light flew out and shot towards those in the young generation.<br>&ldquo;Junior Wuqing, quickly catch them! Those are Immortal Talismans.&rdquo; Xia Yu hurriedly reminded Chu Feng when she saw such a scene. At the same time, she, as well as Chun Wu, Dong Xue, and Qiu Zhu opened up their palms to catch the gradually flying strands of light.<br>Chu Feng did not dally and similarly, opened up his palms to catch the strands of light.<br>*sii~~*<br>After the strand of light entered his hand, Chu Feng felt heat spreading and then, shortly after, such a feeling disappeared. Opening up his palms to take a look, he saw a special symbol on his palm. Moreover, it was as though it had life&mdash;it was slowly wiggling about.<br>&ldquo;These are Immortal Talisman, the exit to the Martial Marking Immortal Realm. When faced with undefeatable danger, or when one wishes to leave the Martial Marking Immortal Realm, imbue Martial power into it. It can bring you away from the Martial Marking Immortal Realm and back to this place.<br>&ldquo;Lastly, I will warn all of you again. The Martial Marking Immortal Realm opens for a limit of ten days. Within ten days, you must leave the Martial Marking Immortal Realm, or else what you will meet is only certain death.<br>&ldquo;Go. New miracles are waiting to be created by you. Do you wish to obtain martial skills you yearn for? Then take out your strength, and rely on yourself to obtain them.&rdquo; Lady Piaomiao&rsquo;s words were engraved on everyone&rsquo;s hearts, making it so no one dared to go against them.<br>Immediately after she finished speaking, almost everyone who had an Immortal Talisman in the mountain peak became strands of light and started to fly up. Like meteors, they shot into the gate.<br>&ldquo;Junior Wuqing, hold onto my hand or else after entering, we will be split up by the Spirit Formation,&rdquo; Chun Wu reminded suddenly just as Chu Feng was going to move.<br>Looking over, only then did Chu Feng discover Chun Wu, Xia Yu, Dong Xue, and Qiu Zhu, the four beauties, holding each other&rsquo;s hands tightly. Furthermore, Chun Wu was extending her pure-white hand to him.<br>Seeing that, Chu Feng lightly smiled and delayed no longer. He stretched out his arm and tightly grabbed Chun Wu&rsquo;s soft hand. Then, with the company of four beauties, and under the admirative gazes of countless males, they charged into the gate of the Martial Marking Immortal Realm.<br>However, just as Chu Feng and the others entered, within the square, Ya Fei, too, was holding hands with her subordinates. However, she was in no rush to move. Instead, she was glaring at the place Chu Feng disappeared in, and said in a low voice, &ldquo;Damned bastard. Don&rsquo;t think that a dream like that can scare me. You better keep on following those four girls, or else if you meet me alone, I will make you wish you were dead.&rdquo;<br></p></div>
