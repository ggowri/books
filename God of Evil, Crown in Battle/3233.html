        <div> - Armor Recognizing Its Master<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Reportedly, the Fire Qilin Armor had extremely powerful defensive capabilities. Wearing the Fire Qilin Armor, experts beneath the Heavenly Immortal realm would not be able to damage its wearer.<br>Furthermore, if one was able to make the Fire Qilin Armor recognize them as its master, one would be able to unite with the armor. At that time, the Fire Qilin Armor&rsquo;s power would be unleashed to its full potential.<br>Not to mention that one would be completely unharmed by Heavenly Immortal-level experts, one would also be able to keep one&rsquo;s life when encountering Martial Immortal-level experts.<br>Chu Feng had attempted to link with the Fire Qilin Armor and make it recognize him as its master before.<br>Unfortunately, he had failed in his every attempt. Chu Feng suspected that the reason for his failure was because his cultivation was insufficient. He felt that he would likely succeed in making the Fire Qilin Armor recognize him as its master should he reach rank nine Heavenly Immortal.<br>As for now, Chu Feng just so happened to be a rank nine Heavenly Immortal.<br>Thinking of it, Chu Feng stopped his hesitation and sat down cross-legged. He closed his eyes and began to focus on linking with the Fire Qilin Armor so as to make it recognize him as its master.<br>Meanwhile, the Nightmare Spirit Clansman that was captured by Chu Feng, although imprisoned, was able to see Chu Feng&rsquo;s every move.<br>That Nightmare Heavenly Clansman had no idea what Chu Feng was doing. He also had no idea what Chu Feng was planning. Seeing that Chu Feng had immediately sat down cross-legged upon finding out how strong Linghu Lun was, he thought that Chu Feng had given up on fighting him.<br>Unable to contain himself, the Nightmare Spirit Clansman mocked, &ldquo;Chu Feng, it&rsquo;s still not too late for you to realize how powerful the Linghu Heavenly Clan is. If you are to release me now and then seek out Linghu Lun and apologize to him, perhaps he&rsquo;ll be willing to let you go. Otherwise, if he is to capture you himself, I dare to guarantee that you will suffer miserably.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right after that Nightmare Spirit Clansman&rsquo;s words left his mouth, boundless flames began to spew out of Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br>&ldquo;What&hellip; what is that?&rdquo;<br>Seeing the surging flames, that Nightmare Spirit Clansman was immediately alarmed.<br>He was able to sense how powerful those raging flames were. It was simply a power comparable to that of Martial Immortals.<br>After being astonished, that Nightmare Spirit Clansman began to carefully examine the raging flames. Upon doing so, he discovered that there was a silhouette deep within the raging flames.<br>It was Chu Feng.<br>Due to the intense raging flames, he was actually unable to see Chu Feng&rsquo;s image clearly. However, he was able to clearly see that Chu Feng was no longer wearing a gown. Instead, there was a suit of fiery armor on his body.<br>That armor was extremely dazzling. Even though it was surrounded by flames, the armor&rsquo;s imposing might was still in full effect.<br>&ldquo;Could that be the legendary Fire Qilin Armor?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, even if it&rsquo;s the Fire Qilin Armor, it shouldn&rsquo;t possess such power. Could it be&hellip; Chu Feng managed to make it recognize him as its master?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That Chu Feng actually managed to make the Fire Qilin Armor recognize him as its master?!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the Nightmare Spirit Clansman was practically certain that it was the Fire Qilin Armor. Furthermore, he was certain that the Fire Qilin Armor had recognized Chu Feng as its master.<br>Although Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation did not increase after the Fire Qilin Armor recognized him as its master, the power of the Fire Qilin Armor was even more powerful than he had anticipated.<br>At that moment, the Nightmare Spirit Clansman had an astonished and even stupefied expression.<br>The reason for that was because he knew very well that making the Fire Qilin Armor recognize one as its master was not merely an issue of one&rsquo;s cultivation.<br>Otherwise, the experts of the Ancestral Martial Starfield would&rsquo;ve already had the Fire Qilin Armor recognize them as its master long ago.<br>What was most important in making the Fire Qilin Armor recognize one as its master was actually one&rsquo;s talent. Only individuals with sufficiently powerful talent would be able to make the Fire Qilin Armor recognize him or her as its master. Evidently&hellip; Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent had attained the acknowledgement of the Fire Qilin Armor.<br>&ldquo;Crackle~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the boundless flames began to shrink. In the blink of an eye, the flames returned to Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br>Most astonishingly, after the flames disappeared, Chu Feng&rsquo;s gown was completely undamaged.<br>Although the surging flames were very powerful, they did not harm Chu Feng in the slightest. It was so much so that not even Chu Feng&rsquo;s clothes were burned by the flames. It seemed that the flames were under Chu Feng&rsquo;s total control.<br>&ldquo;What did you say earlier?&rdquo; Chu Feng turned to ask that Nightmare Spirit Clansman.<br>&ldquo;Not&hellip; nothing,&rdquo; that Nightmare Spirit Clansman had a frightened expression. He was afraid that Chu Feng would attack him.<br>&ldquo;You witnessed everything that happened earlier?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I&hellip; I did,&rdquo; that Nightmare Spirit Clansman replied.<br>&ldquo;In that case, do you think that, with the power of this armor, Linghu Lun will be able to cause me harm?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know. However, I think&hellip; he will likely not be able to harm you,&rdquo; that Nightmare Spirit Clansman said.<br>&ldquo;Very well. Thanks to that answer of yours, I will spare you today,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled and then soared into the sky.<br>Actually, even without that Nightmare Spirit Clansman telling him that, Chu Feng knew it himself.<br>After having made the Fire Qilin Armor recognize him as its master, the power that was released by the Fire Qilin Armor was stronger than Chu Feng had imagined.<br>Originally, Chu Feng had thought that he would have to seek out opportunities to rescue Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu. He felt that even after making the Fire Qilin Armor recognize him as its master, he would, at the very most, only be able to use it to protect his life at a crucial moment, and would not be able to contend against Linghu Lun.<br>However, Chu Feng now felt that, while the Fire Qilin Armor&rsquo;s power might not be able to contend against Linghu Lun, Linghu Lun would not be able to injure him either.<br>As such, there was no need to go through the effort of seeking out an opportunity to strike. Instead, he could directly proceed to rescue the captured Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu.<br>Currently, the three Heaven-reaching Beast Clansman had already brought Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu to the central region of the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.<br>The Symbols of Light on Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu&rsquo;s foreheads had stunned not only those three Heaven-reaching Beast Clansmen, but also all the others present. Even Linghu Lun was very shocked by their Symbols of Light.<br>The reason for that was because he knew the enormous amount of Ores of Light required in order to condense such powerful Symbols of Light.<br>As such, Linghu Lun determined that it was no coincidence that Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu were able to condense such powerful Symbols of Light. He was certain that they had a method to seek out cultivation resources.<br>Because of this, he did not immediately take the Symbols of Light from Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu. Instead, he began to torture them.<br>Furthermore, through the torture, Linghu Lun learned that it was Chu Feng who had led them to those cultivation resource sites.<br>Everything was thanks to Chu Feng.<br>At that moment, Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu were not only completely covered in cuts and bruises and drenched in blood from head to toe, but their mental states were also on the verge of crumbling.<br>&ldquo;Speak! Where is Chu Feng?! Tell me where Chu Feng is and I will spare you,&rdquo; Linghu Lun said.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right as Linghu Lun was saying those words, two figures landed from the sky.<br>They were Mengyan Wushuang and Tongtian Yuanming.<br>The two of them were carrying several people with them. Those people were the Li Heavenly Clansmen. All of the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s newcomers were captured by them. Even Li Anzhi was captured.<br>Furthermore, among the Li Heavenly Clansmen, Li Anzhi&rsquo;s injuries were the most serious.<br>Evidently, Li Anzhi had gone through a fierce battle against them.<br></p></div>
