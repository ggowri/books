        <h1>Chapter 3301</h1>
        <div> - Kept In Suspense<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd all revealed surprised looks upon finding out Chu Feng&rsquo;s identity. Even Liangqiu Chengfeng was not an exception.<br>Had it been someone else, perhaps the crowd would not be reacting in such a manner. However, the son of Chu Xuanyuan was simply not something that they&rsquo;d ever anticipated.<br>Astonished, someone asked, &ldquo;When did Chu Xuanyuan have another son?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I seem to remember that Chu Xuanyuan only had a single son,&rdquo; Li Ruochu said.<br>&ldquo;A single son? Wouldn&rsquo;t that mean that it&rsquo;s &lsquo;that&rsquo; trash that was incapable of cultivating, that Chu Feng?&rdquo; Someone asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s him,&rdquo; Li Ruochu said.<br>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it said that he&rsquo;s already dead?&rdquo; Someone asked in astonishment.<br>&ldquo;One should only believe what one sees with one&rsquo;s own eyes, and not what one hears from others. Furthermore, that child isn&rsquo;t incapable of cultivating. His talent will be revealed in the future,&rdquo; Li Ruochu said.<br>As a member of the Li Heavenly Clan, Li Ruochu knew very well that it was that young man by the name of Chu Feng who had beat back the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations all by himself.<br>Their Li Heavenly Clan even considered that matter to be a disgrace.<br>However, she, Li Ruochu, did not feel that way. The reason for that was because she did not hold any hostility toward the Chu Heavenly Clan to begin with.<br>After hearing what Li Ruochu said, the crowd began to look to Chu Feng with complicated gazes.<br>&ldquo;That guy actually concealed his cultivation with a treasure? Truly impudent!&rdquo; Someone spoke in an aggrieved manner.<br>That person wanted to see through Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation, but failed to do so.<br>&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t see through his cultivation, then you can&rsquo;t see though it. Why use such a rebuking tone to say that he used a treasure to conceal his cultivation?&rdquo; Li Ruochu asked.<br>&ldquo;A mere person of the younger generation, if he didn&rsquo;t use a treasure, how could he possibly be able to conceal his cultivation from me?&rdquo; That man said.<br>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t he? Even if his cultivation is below yours, should his world spirit techniques be superior to yours, you won&rsquo;t be able to see through his cultivation,&rdquo; Li Ruochu said.<br>&ldquo;What a joke! Although this old man is focused on the path of martial cultivation, I am still an Insect Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritist. Are you trying to tell me that he, a mere sprat from the younger generation, possesses world spirit techniques that surpass my own?&rdquo; That person spoke in a very displeased manner.<br>Hearing what he said, many people nodded in approval.<br>However, Li Ruochu merely smiled, and said no more.<br>She did not know how strong Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spirit techniques might be. In fact, she didn&rsquo;t even know if Chu Feng had concealed his cultivation with treasures.<br>However, she disliked the arrogant behavior of the crowd.<br>Even though she did not experience the era when Chu Xuanyuan shook the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield, she had heard about it, and knew of Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s various achievements.<br>When he suddenly emerged, news about him spread all over. However, the majority of the people simply did not believe the rumors they heard. They did not believe that a person of the younger generation could be that powerful.<br>Not only did they not believe it, but they instead mocked Chu Xuanyuan.<br>However, after those people encountered Chu Xuanyuan and witnessed his might, they immediately began to wag their tails at him.<br>Li Ruochu knew that the people present were all people that felt enormous fear toward Chu Xuanyuan. Yet&hellip; merely because of rumors they&rsquo;d heard, they began to declare that his son was a nobody.<br>Li Ruochu wasn't very fond of such of behavior.<br>&ldquo;That child is truly very extraordinary,&rdquo; right at that moment, Liangqiu Chengfeng spoke again.<br>&ldquo;Milord, why do you say that?&rdquo;<br>The crowd immediately took note of Liangqiu Chengfeng&rsquo;s comment. Not only did they not refute him like they did Li Ruochu, but they instead reacted as if they were humbly seeking his guidance.<br>&ldquo;He is not only simply observing my unsealing formation. Instead, he is earnestly examining it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s trying to find some profound theories from this unsealing formation of mine,&rdquo; Liangqiu Chengfeng said.<br>&ldquo;Find some profound theories? Someone like him?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That child is truly arrogant!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Instead of inheriting Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s talent, he has inherited his arrogance. Alas~~~&rdquo;<br>After Liangqiu Chengfeng said those words, many people immediately began to mock Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Although I cannot be certain, judging from that child&rsquo;s gaze, I suspect that that child&rsquo;s world spirit techniques are at least that of a Snake Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritist,&rdquo; Liangqiu Chengfeng said.<br>&ldquo;Milord, are you serious?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the crowd all revealed astonished looks. They had originally thought that Li Ruochu was spouting nonsense. They had truly never anticipated for Chu Feng to possibly be an Exalted-cloak World Spiritist.<br>However, as it was a comment made by Liangqiu Chengfeng, they had no choice but to take it seriously.<br>&ldquo;I am not joking around. Furthermore&hellip; that child&rsquo;s cultivation is also considerably outstanding,&rdquo; Liangqiu Chengfeng said.<br>After Liangqiu Chengfeng finished saying those words, not only did the astonished look in the crowd&rsquo;s eyes grow stronger, but their expressions also changed.<br>Evidently, Liangqiu Chengfeng had managed to see through Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation. Furthermore&hellip; Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation was very remarkable. Otherwise&hellip; he would not evaluate Chu Feng in such a manner.<br>&ldquo;Milord, that Chu Feng&hellip; what is his cultivation?&rdquo; Someone asked.<br>&ldquo;Since that child has deliberately concealed his cultivation, there must be a reason as to why he did that. As such, this old man will not leak his cultivation. When he wants to reveal it, everyone will know then,&rdquo; Liangqiu Chengfeng said with a faint smile.<br>The crowd were made rather uncomfortable by Liangqiu Chengfeng&rsquo;s response.<br>He had completely incited their interest, yet refused to give them an answer. This sort of feeling was truly uncomfortable.<br>At the moment when the crowd appeared visibly helpless, Liangqiu Chengfeng added, &ldquo;At least, judging from the present, that child&hellip; has not tarnished the title of being Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>After Liangqiu Chengfeng said those words, the crowd began to look at Chu Feng with even more serious expressions.<br>Not tarnish the title of being Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son? That evaluation was truly high.<br>Some among them even began to use special observation methods in the hopes of being able to see through Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation.<br>The reason for that was purely because Liangqiu Chengfeng&rsquo;s words had completely incited the crowd&rsquo;s curiosity. They all wanted to know exactly how exceptional, how talented, Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son was.<br>Unfortunately, their powers of observation were already affected by being inside the formation core.<br>Adding on Chu Feng deliberately concealing his cultivation, even though the people inside the formation core were all Exalted-level experts, no one, with the exception of Liangqiu Chengfeng, was able to see through Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation.<br>At the moment when the crowd were all revealing complicated expressions, the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief once again revealed a complicated gaze.<br>He had turned his gaze that was focused on Chu Feng to the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. He had a faint feeling that there seemed to be an extraordinary reason as to why the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had brought Chu Feng there.<br>&lsquo;Old bastard, for you to bring that sort of brat to our clan, you couldn&rsquo;t possibly be trying to challenge our clan&rsquo;s genius, right?&rsquo; The Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief thought in his heart.<br>Chu Feng had no idea what was happening inside the formation core. Thus, he was still focused on examining that grand unsealing formation.<br>Suddenly, that Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder asked, &ldquo;Why bring so many people of the younger generation here?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was originally focused on examining the grand unsealing formation. However, upon hearing that sentence, he turned his gaze over.<br>At that moment, he discovered that there were several dozens of the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations that were being brought over toward them.<br>&ldquo;Lord Supreme Elder, Lord Liangqiu Chengfeng had discovered the location to breach the grand formation. Soon, he will activate the grand unsealing formation. However, he needs the assistance from some of our younger generations. That is why we brought our clan&rsquo;s younger generation&rsquo;s genius world spiritists here,&rdquo; a Wuma Heavenly Clansman stood forth and reported.<br></p></div>
