        <h1>Chapter 3916</h1>
        <div> - Grandmaster Tang Chen<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t know was that right after he left, a figure appeared in the place.<br>It was an old man. He wore a black gown and had a head of long hair. Although he looked very old, he also appeared very spirited.<br>Most importantly, the aura and presence he emitted were extremely rare in the world.<br>That man fully gave off the air of an immortal.<br>That person was Grandmaster Yuan Shu&rsquo;s master, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s close friend, Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>Yuan Shu walked up to his master and asked, &ldquo;Master, why didn&rsquo;t you help directly?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No matter what, brother Chu Feng is senior Ox-nose&rsquo;s disciple. If some sort of unexpected accident is to happen to him in your territory, senior Ox-nose will likely be unhappy, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Humph, what does anything that could happen to his disciple have anything to do with me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, this old man has already saved him once.&rdquo; Grandmaster Tang Chen spoke. His voice was identical to that of the mysterious old man&rsquo;s voice Chu Feng had heard in the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb.<br>Sure enough, the person who had rescued Chu Feng all on his own and then defeated the Galewind Hunting Clan&rsquo;s experts was Yuan Shu&rsquo;s master, Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not too good, no? How about I go and check things out?&rdquo; said Yuan Shu.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not allowed to go.&rdquo; Grandmaster Tang Chen immediately lashed out at Yuan Shu.<br>&ldquo;Are we really going to disregard this?&rdquo; asked Yuan Shu.<br>&ldquo;Yuan Shu, what have I, your master, taught you? Do you think you&rsquo;re a savior? Must you save everyone&rsquo;s life?&rdquo; asked Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;Of course not. If I felt that way, I wouldn&rsquo;t have done nothing as those black-clothed people massacred the innocent. More than that, I wouldn&rsquo;t have ignored the Red-dress Holy Land.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, brother Chu Feng is different from those people. After all, he is senior Ox-nose&rsquo;s disciple. Furthermore, I also like him a lot,&rdquo; said Yuan Shu.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s still a no. You are absolutely not allowed to do anything. Otherwise, this old man will break all ties with you,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;Okay okay okay. I will definitely not do anything. Master, please cool your temper, please do not break all ties with me. Your disciple still needs master&rsquo;s guidance.&rdquo;<br>Although that was what Yuan Shu was saying, he had a mischievous smile on his face.<br>Although Yuan Shu was seen to be the all powerful Grandmaster Yuan Shu in the eyes of others, his behavior was like that of a child when he was before his master.<br>From this, it could be seen that the relationship of that master and disciple was extremely good.<br>&ldquo;This could also be considered to be a test for him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The treasures inside the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Blood Refinement Pond have long since been retrieved by your master.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That Ancient Era&rsquo;s Blood Refinement Pond is nothing more than an empty mystic grounds now. There&rsquo;s nothing to gain from there at all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of that, the protective barrier of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Blood Refinement Pond is much weaker than before.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If that brat by the name of Chu Feng is unable to handle even such a weakened Ancient Era&rsquo;s Blood Refinement Pond, how exactly is he supposed to challenge my bet with Ox-nose?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s unable to even handle that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Blood Refinement Pond, it would mean that he&rsquo;s a failure, and might as well die. It&rsquo;s better for Ox-nose to find a new disciple,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;Master, that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Blood Refinement Pond is only easy for you. For brother Chu Feng, it would not be easy at all. Even for me, I might not necessarily be able to handle it,&rdquo; said Yuan Shu.<br>&ldquo;Say what? You said you&rsquo;re unable to handle that mere Ancient Era&rsquo;s Blood Refinement Pond?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This old man had strenuously nurtured you for all these years, yet you&rsquo;re only this capable?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re unable to even handle that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Blood Refinement Pond, you might as well scram right away. Do not attempt to go and breach the spirit formation established by Ox-nose, for you will only humiliate this old man.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Grandmaster Tang Chen was actually somewhat angry.<br>&ldquo;Master, I was wrong. I was truly wrong.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that, Yuan Shu no longer dared to smile mischievously anymore. He immediately began to appease his master.<br>&hellip;&hellip;<br>Meanwhile. Chu Feng and Yin Zhuanghong were proceeding toward the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Blood Refinement Pond.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you really managed to meet Grandmaster Yuan Shu? He really told you there&rsquo;s another entrance to the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Blood Refinement Pond?&rdquo; Yin Zhuanghong asked en route.<br>She felt very shocked. After all, their Red-dress Holy Land had been controlling the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Blood Refinement Pond the entire time.<br>They should know the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Blood Refinement Pond better than anyone.<br>Yet, Chu Feng had actually told her that there was another entrance to the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Blood Refinement Pond. Naturally, she would be shocked. After all, she had never heard of anyone mention there being another entrance before.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster Yuan Shu definitely wouldn&rsquo;t lie to me.&rdquo;<br>Compared to the slightly skeptical Yin Zhuanghong, Chu Feng was extremely certain that there was another entrance.<br>Soon, Chu Feng and Yin Zhuanghong arrived at a forest.<br>There were many natural springs in the forest. The entrance Yuan Shu had told Chu Feng about was located in a natural spring.<br>As Chu Feng had the map, he managed to accurately find that natural spring.<br>&ldquo;This is the one,&rdquo; Chu Feng pointed to the natural spring.<br>&ldquo;Were you deceived? My eyes are unable to detect anything from it,&rdquo; said Yin Zhuanghong.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll know whether I was deceived once we enter it.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he jumped into the natural spring. Seeing that, Yin Zhuanghong, having no other choice, jumped in after him.<br>At the beginning, there was no change to the natural spring at all. However, as they dove further, a bypass appeared in the waterflow.<br>There was a very small tunnel deep in the natural spring. There was also spring water inside that tunnel. Merely, the color of the spring water was actually red.<br>Once Chu Feng swam into the tunnel, a strong reek of blood assailed his nostrils. That reek of blood came from the red spring water.<br>Most importantly, Chu Feng was certain that it was indeed water, and not blood.<br>Although it was not blood, both its appearance and smell were identical to blood.<br></p></div>
