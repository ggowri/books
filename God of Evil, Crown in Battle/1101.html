        <h1>Chapter 1101</h1>
        <div> - Mysterious Gaze<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>After putting the Ascension Sect&rsquo;s previous Sectmaster&rsquo;s remains away, Chu Feng arrived onto the ninth floor.<br>When he arrived onto the ninth floor, the pressure from the Southern Cyanwood Forest&rsquo;s Pagoda became very enormous. It was even comparable to the bottom of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond.<br>However, this amount of pressure was still not a problem for Chu Feng. After all, he was able to withstand the pressure at the bottom of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond, so how could the pressure here possibly affect him?<br>However, as he continued onward up the stairs leading to the tenth floor, at the time when he arrived before the juncture to the tenth floor, another spirit formation gate appeared before him.<br>With the experience that Chu Feng possessed, he felt that this spirit formation gate was extraordinary. Although it appeared nothing but ordinary; there was a large possibility that there would be a formation array on the other side of this spirit formation gate. Moreover, it would not be a simple one. Likely, it would be the final checkpoint of the Southern Cyanwood Forest&rsquo;s Pagoda, the thing that would be hardest to pass.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that trying to pass through this Southern Cyanwood Forest&rsquo;s Pagoda is more difficult than I expected. No wonder no one has managed to reach the top after all these thousands of years.&rdquo;<br>Having reached this point, Chu Feng had no other option. If he wanted to reach the top, he had to enter this place.<br>Thus, Chu Feng did not hesitate and directly entered the spirit formation gate.<br>&ldquo;Boom.&rdquo;<br>At the moment when he stepped past the spirit formation gate, Chu Feng suddenly felt his vision turn dark. At this instant, it felt like there were explosions running through his brain. While his eyes were fuzzy, his ears were rumbling.<br>&ldquo;What a nauseating formation array.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng determined in his heart that the situation wasn&rsquo;t good. This formation array was truly too nauseating. It did not test one&rsquo;s endurance; instead, it directly affected one&rsquo;s senses.<br>At this moment, all five of Chu Feng&rsquo;s senses were being affected. It gave him a very nauseating sensation. There was nothing Chu Feng could do to change that. All he could do was to continue onward through sheer willpower.<br>This was truly a type of torture enough to cause one&rsquo;s collapse. Even Chu Feng was beginning to sway slightly.<br>That was because he discovered that if he were to stop moving, the effect on his senses would be tolerable. However, once he began to move, the effect would increase. However, if he were to retreat, then the effect would disappear completely.<br>But, Chu Feng could not retreat. After all, this matter not only concerned the honor of the Southern Cyanwood Forest, it also concerned his honor.<br>Therefore, Chu Feng could only continue onward. Even if his willpower crumbled, even if he encountered life-threatening danger, Chu Feng would still not give up. Furthermore, at this moment, Chu Feng had some confidence in himself.<br>Finally, with Chu Feng&rsquo;s tenacious willpower, the nauseating sensation and the feeling of his consciousness in disarray disappeared. What appeared before Chu Feng was a spirit formation gate.<br>Turning back to look, Chu Feng was able to see the spirit formation gate that led to the tenth floor. It turned out that what he had walked through earlier had merely been a long hallway.<br>On all four walls of this long hallway shone bright, glittering runes and symbols. Most importantly, Chu Feng actually felt a trace of familiar aura from this place. It was Bai Ruochen&rsquo;s aura.<br>&ldquo;That girl is indeed lying. What does she mean by saying she only reached the sixth floor, she has clearly reached the ninth floor and even walked this long hallway.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, why did she lie?&rdquo; Chu Feng thought for a moment. He did not understand why Bai Ruochen lied. However, he knew that she had not passed the test of the long hallway. She had only gotten one third of the way through before giving up. As for Chu Feng, he had passed through the entire hallway.<br>Thinking to this part, Chu Feng displayed a complacent smile on his face. That was because the final test was indeed extremely hard. However, he had managed to succeed.<br>At this moment, Chu Feng took a step forward. He passed through that spirit formation gate. When his vision returned, he had entered the tenth floor of the Southern Cyanwood Forest&rsquo;s Pagoda.<br>Compared to the ninth floor, the tenth floor was even more narrow and truly even smaller.<br>However, that was not important. What was important was that in this small and narrow space was a very important item.<br>It was a stone sculpture of an old man. This old man possessed a large and robust figure, and a handsome appearance. With the extraordinary aura displayed by the sculpture, one could tell with a single glance that the old man had been an extraordinary expert.<br>Most importantly, this old man was holding a sword in his hand.<br>This sword was a meter long. It was not part of the sculpture; it was an actual sword. However, if one was to carefully inspect it, one would discover that it was not a sword. Instead, it was a key[1. Keyblade, anyone?], an extraordinary key.<br>&ldquo;Spirit formation key.&rdquo; With a single glance, Chu Feng was able to recognize what it was.<br>After that, Chu Feng began to carefully inspect his surroundings. He discovered that, other than the sculpture and the spirit formation key that the sculpture held, there was nothing else on this tenth floor.<br>At this moment, Chu Feng was pretty certain that the sculpture was that of his Southern Cyanwood Forest&rsquo;s founder, Baili Xuankong.<br>As for the key in Baili Xuankong&rsquo;s hand, it should be the keepsake.<br>&ldquo;Junior Chu Feng pays his respect to ancestor.&rdquo; Thinking to this point, Chu Feng paid his respects to the sculpture.<br>After all, he was a disciple of the Southern Cyanwood Forest, and Baili Xuankong was the ancestor of the Southern Cyanwood Forest. Thus, even though it was only a sculpture, Chu Feng still could not disrespect Baili Xuankong and had to pay his respects to him.<br>After paying his respects, Chu Feng walked forward. He wanted to remove the key from the sculpture.<br>&ldquo;Buzz.&rdquo;<br>However, who would&rsquo;ve thought that right after Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand touched that spirit formation key, a special energy would rush into his hand. Immediately after, the energy returned to the spirit formation key.<br>The most fearful thing was that after the energy returned to the spirit formation key, it actually brought Chu Feng&rsquo;s aura along with it. At this moment, a binding was cast onto Chu Feng&rsquo;s body by that spirit formation key.<br>&ldquo;Automatically recognizing its master?&rdquo; Chu Feng was surprised. Even though he had expected this spirit formation key to be extraordinary, he did not expect it to be this powerful and actually capable of recognizing its master.<br>However, Chu Feng was unable to understand. As a keepsake, this spirit formation key should be left in the care of the Ascension Sect. For it to actually recognize him as its master, what exactly was the meaning behind that?<br>However, since Baili Xuankong had arranged it so, there would definitely be a reason for it. Thus, Chu Feng did not bother to overthink it, picked up the spirit formation key, and began to walk towards the exit.<br>&ldquo;This sensation?&rdquo; However, right when Chu Feng reached the spirit formation gate, his gaze suddenly flashed. Immediately after, he hurried to turned around and cast his gaze onto the sculpture of Baili Xuankong.<br>That was because earlier, Chu Feng had felt that someone was watching him from behind. As for the source of that gaze, it was precisely from the eyes of the sculpture of Baili Xuankong.<br>However, this sculpture did not appear to be abnormal at all. Like before, it was very calm and quiet. With doubt in his heart, Chu Feng activated his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes to inspect the sculpture. However, he still did not find anything.<br>&ldquo;Could it have been a misperception?&rdquo; Chu Feng was very confident in his sensitivity. Thus, he did not feel that the sensation he had had earlier had been a misperception. But, since he was unable to determine any abnormality with this sculpture, Chu Feng had no choice but to accept it as such.<br>&ldquo;Lord Ancestor, this disciple will be leaving.&rdquo; However, before Chu Feng left, he once again paid his respects to the sculpture of Baili Xuankong. Only then did he turn around to leave.<br>This time, Chu Feng did not feel the sensation of being watched. However, his heart remained restless. After all, since such a thing had happened, he felt it to be very strange.<br>That was because the sensation of the gaze that he had felt earlier seemed to have been from a human.<br></p></div>
