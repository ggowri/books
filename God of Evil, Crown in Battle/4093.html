        <h1>Chapter 4092</h1>
        <div> - Expressing Skepticism<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Pang Youyang laughed at the situation.<br>&ldquo;Our Purple Star Hall will not interfere in matters between you all. However, of the two Star-guiding Stones young friend Chu Feng held in his hand, one does belong to the Constellation Immortal Isle.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, it is not something that this old man helped obtain. Rather, he snatched it from the Constellation Immortal Isle himself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If the Xuanming Family&rsquo;s Family Head wishes to snatch away the Star-guiding Stones from his hand, this old man will definitely not stop you. However, I&rsquo;d urge you to consider it carefully.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master is already dead,&rdquo; said Pang Youyang.<br>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master is dead?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the expressions of the Xuanming Family&rsquo;s Family Head and everyone else present all changed.<br>As matters stood, the majority of the crowd had realized that the young man from the Chu Heavenly Clan standing before them was actually that genius Chu Feng.<br>However, the reason for their astonishment was not Chu Feng&rsquo;s identity. Rather, it was the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master&rsquo;s death.<br>The Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master was publicly accepted by all of them to be the strongest among the ten overlords.<br>How could an existence of his caliber die?<br>Furthermore, he died without the Purple Star Hall meddling?<br>Could it be that he was killed by a powerful Purple Star Variance Beast?<br>But, from the words spoken by Pang Youyang, he was clearly implying that to not be the case.<br>Could it be that the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master was killed by that Chu Feng?<br>At this moment, the crowd all turned their gazes to Chu Feng.<br>They were all sizing him up with a surprised yet somewhat skeptical gaze.<br>It was only natural that they would be skeptical. After all, they were unable to believe it to be true.<br>How could a person of the younger generation possess enough strength to kill the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master?<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother looking anymore. That&rsquo;s right, it was done by my little brother Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you all don&rsquo;t believe that, you can ask the people outside later,&rdquo; said Li Mengyue.<br>&ldquo;Ask the people outside?&rdquo;<br>The crowd were all puzzled upon hearing those words.<br>Why would they ask people outside about the matters inside the Purple Star Variance Realm?<br>&ldquo;You all have been in the Purple Star Variance Realm the entire time, and have no idea of the change that has occurred outside.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The change to the Purple Star Variance Realm is no longer confined to the Purple Star Variance Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;An abnormal sign has occurred outside. That abnormal sign covered the sky, and illuminated everything inside the Purple Star Variance Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s movements are being seen clearly by the people outside the Purple Star Variance Realm,&rdquo; explained Pang Youyang.<br>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Then, wouldn&rsquo;t it mean that he&hellip; really killed the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master?&rdquo;<br>At this moment, the crowd came to a realization.<br>If the people outside were able to see everything, Li Mengyue couldn&rsquo;t possibly lie. That would mean that what she said was the truth, and that Chu Feng was truly so powerful that not even the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master was a match for him.<br>Upon learning the truth, the gazes that the various powers looked to Chu Feng with turned complicated.<br>However, in terms of having the most ugly expressions, it would be the people from the Xuanming Family.<br>Due to the conflict between Chu Feng and Xuan Yihang, the Xuanming Family had led their experts to intercept the Chu Heavenly Clan and cause trouble for them.<br>However, none of them had expected Chu Feng to be this powerful.<br>When this came to his mind, the Xuanming Family&rsquo;s Family Head suddenly felt like thanking the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster.<br>If it wasn&rsquo;t for her interference that day, they would&rsquo;ve most definitely taught the Chu Heavenly Clan a ruthless lesson.<br>If they did that, they would&rsquo;ve definitely provoked Chu Feng.<br>If that was the case, it would not be the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master that would be killed today but rather he, Xuan Tianpeng, instead.<br>When this thought came to his mind, the Xuanming Family&rsquo;s Family Head grew furious.<br>He waved his sleeve and, with a loud pow, sent a resounding slap to Xuan Yihang&rsquo;s face.<br>&ldquo;You absolute disgrace! Since you saw Young Hero Chu Feng, why are you still not kneeling and apologizing to him?!&rdquo; The Xuanming Family&rsquo;s Family Head shouted angrily at Xuan Yihang.<br>&ldquo;Father, you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Xuan Yihang was completely puzzled. Momentarily, he had no idea what was going on.<br>&ldquo;Kneel!&rdquo;<br>Xuan Tianpeng raised his leg and kicked Xuan Yihang, forcing him to kneel before Chu Feng.<br>Then, with an apologetic look on his face, Xuan Tianpeng clasped his fist at Chu Feng. &ldquo;Young Hero Chu Feng, my son is insensible, and had offended your Chu Heavenly Clan. I hope you will not take offense to it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve actually wanted to bring this unfilial son of mine to apologize to you all the entire time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;To my surprise, the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster had some sort of misunderstanding toward my intentions. She thought that I came to cause trouble for you all. That&rsquo;s why I ended up being unable to offer my apology beforehand.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since I&rsquo;m able to meet Young Hero Chu Feng here today, I will naturally have to settle this matter. I hope that Young Hero Chu Feng will be magnanimous, give my son a chance, and forgive his previous mistakes.&rdquo;<br>He was actually publicly apologizing.<br>But, everyone knew that, that day, he had gone to the Chu Heavenly Clan to cause trouble for them, and not to apologize to them at all.<br>Because of that, many people revealed looks of contempt.<br>They thought to themselves that this Xuan Tianpeng was truly shameless.<br>Knowing the truth fully well, Chu Feng merely let out a cold chuckle. He completely ignored Xuan Tianpeng and instead turned his gaze to the sky above.<br>&ldquo;Let us set aside the conflicts of the past for the time being.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What we have to do right now is settle this unforeseen event occuring in the Purple Star Variance Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Else, all of us will die here,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;All of us will die here?&rdquo;<br>The crowd&rsquo;s expressions changed upon hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;Little brother Chu Feng, didn&rsquo;t you say that everyone has been guided here by the Star-guiding Stones?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Star-guiding Stones will only be attracted by natural energies. As such, this place should contain a very dense amount of natural energies, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why would you be saying that this place is dangerous?&rdquo; Li Mengyue questioned. She was extremely confused.<br>The others also looked to Chu Feng with curiosity.<br>&ldquo;While it is true that within the clouds above us contain an enormous amount of natural energies, those natural energies are not friendly at all. Instead, they&rsquo;re extremely dangerous,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Dangerous natural energies?&rdquo; The crowd felt even more confused after hearing that.<br>&ldquo;This place is not the only dangerous place. Right now, the entire Purple Star Variance Realm is extremely dangerous.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If my guess is correct, even if we are to attempt to leave the Purple Star Variance Realm now, we will not be able to.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We must breach this situation before our eyes first in order to safely leave this place,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;According to you, we&hellip; are trapped here?&rdquo;<br>The crowd all became extremely alarmed upon hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s correct.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng replied with certainty.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re kidding.&rdquo;<br>The crowd narrowed their brows at Chu Feng&rsquo;s definitive answer. They were expressing their skepticism.<br>While they&rsquo;d learned that Chu Feng had killed the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master, and was very powerful and ruthless, they were all able to witness the situation before them with their very eyes.<br>The sky above them was covered in dense white clouds. Even though a faintly discernible giant face was present in them, that face was not terrifying at all.<br>They were also unable to sense any sort of threat from within the clouds.<br>Most importantly, they were unable to obtain any clues from either the dense clouds or that face within them.<br>Since they were unable to determine anything, what made Chu Feng qualified to say that this place was very dangerous?<br>Furthermore, he was so certain that the exit to the Purple Star Variance Realm was sealed?<br>This was simply a bit too unbelievable, no?<br></p></div>
