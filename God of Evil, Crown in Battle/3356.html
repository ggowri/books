        <div> - Lightning Armor<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Am I mishearing things? That Chu Feng just said that half a cup of tea&rsquo;s worth of time is enough?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What is he trying to imply?&rdquo;<br>The crowd were all very puzzled upon hearing what Chu Feng said. It was not only the bystanders that were puzzled. Even Fang Hualong, who was fighting Chu Feng, was completely puzzled.<br>&ldquo;What did you just say?&rdquo; Fang Hualong narrowed his brows as he looked at Chu Feng. He was very displeased. He felt that Chu Feng&rsquo;s words seemed to be insulting him.<br>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t hear it properly? That&rsquo;s alright, I can repeat myself,&rdquo; compared to Fang Hualong&rsquo;s furious glare, Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes were smiling as he said something that greatly puzzled and displeased Fang Hualong.<br>&ldquo;Thanks for the reminder,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Thank me? What are you trying to imply?&rdquo; Fang Hualong started becoming irritated. Although he had no idea what sort of trick Chu Feng was trying to pull, he felt that he was acting very disrespectful toward him.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine, you will soon come to understand,&rdquo; the smile on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face grew even more intense.<br>&ldquo;Bastard, you&rsquo;re courting death!&rdquo; Fang Hualong gnashed his teeth furiously. He was unable to understand why Chu Feng would remain so calm and even say those incomprehensible things when victory was already in his grasp.<br>That said, he had no heart to concern himself with all that. Although victory was already within his grasp, he could not tolerate Chu Feng&rsquo;s belittling of him. Thus, he planned to teach Chu Feng a lesson.<br>&ldquo;Zzzzz~~~&rdquo;<br>However, before Fang Hualong could attack Chu Feng, dazzling electric light suddenly appeared before him.<br>The dazzling flash of lightning was extremely fast. Before he could react, the lightning had passed by him.<br>&ldquo;Ahhh!!!&rdquo;<br>In the next moment, Fang Hualong let out a scream of pain.<br>At that moment, everyone was stupefied, stunned by the scene.<br>Not only did Fang Hualong vomit blood after the lightning passed by him, but half of his waist had been sliced off, causing his blood to dye his clothes red.<br>At that moment, Fang Hualong was screaming in pain, and had lost his ability to continue fighting. He did not even possess the power of flight anymore, and was falling straight toward the ground.<br>It was that flash of lightning. That flash of lightning had seriously injured Fang Hualong.<br>However, after seriously injuring Fang Hualong, the flash of lightning did not stop, and instead flew toward the Fang Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s front.<br>The flash of lightning was emitting overwhelming oppressive might. Wherever it passed, space trembled, and violent winds were lifted as everything in its path was destroyed.<br>Before the overwhelming power of that flash of lightning, the Fang Heavenly Clansmen not only suffered a crushing defeat, but even their camps were turned into ruins.<br>In merely a short period of time, all sixty of the Fang Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s camps were destroyed. All of their banners had been turned to ashes. As for the Fang Heavenly Clansmen, they were all injured. In less serious cases, they were badly bloodied. In more serious cases, they had directly lost consciousness, or even lost their physical bodies.<br>Finally, that flash of lightning stopped.<br>At that moment, everyone was able to clearly see that the flash of lightning was Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng had managed to destroy all of the Fang Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s camps and injure all their clansmen, including even Fang Hualong, in nearly an instant.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip; this&hellip; this&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Seeing the current Chu Feng, and then seeing the Fang Heavenly Clansmen, many people were left speechless. However, their eyes were all captured by the dazzling lightning that covered Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng was emitting the aura of a rank nine Martial Immortal, with a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting a level of cultivation.<br>The reason why the crowd were so astonished was not only because of Chu Feng&rsquo;s enormous power. Instead, it was because of the armor that covered him, the Lightning Armor.<br>Everyone present, especially members of Heavenly Clans, knew very well what that armor was. Not only that, they were very familiar with it.<br>The reason for that was because that armor was the power of Heavenly Bloodlines, the Lightning Armor.<br>Before the True Immortal realm, the Lightning Armor was a power that all Heavenly Clansmen possessed.<br>However, after reaching the True Immortal realm, the power of the Lightning Armor would end up being sealed.<br>In the Ancestral Martial Starfield, there were countless experts that possessed Heavenly Bloodlines. However, not even the peak experts among them were capable of utilizing the power of the Lightning Armor.<br>From this, it could be seen how difficult it was to grasp the power of the Lightning Armor again.<br>Yet Chu Feng had actually managed to unseal the power of the Lightning Armor.<br>With this, how could the crowd not be astonished?<br>Not to mention the Fang Heavenly Clan, Zhao Heavenly Clan and the other powers, even the people from the Starfield Master Realm, even Wuming Gangxiong, had an astonished look on his face.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng had truly accomplished what was impossible for others.<br>Furthermore, not only was the power of Chu Feng&rsquo;s Lightning Armor extremely strong, but it also had a very imposing air akin to that of a ruler descending upon the world of mortals.<br>Most importantly, the structure of Chu Feng&rsquo;s Lightning Armor was different from ordinary Lightning Armor.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s Lightning Armor was more refined and aggressive than usual. It simply looked like an uncanny work of art. Both its appearance and the air that it emitted was something that ordinary Lightning Armor could not compare to.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s Lightning Armor was simply unrivalled.<br>&ldquo;Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique, is this the power of Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique?&rdquo;<br>The Fang Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and all the Fang Heavenly Clansmen had extremely ugly and ashen expressions.<br>With the power of the Lightning Armor, Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation had increased from rank eight Martial Immortal to rank nine Martial Immortal. His cultivation was an entire level above Fang Hualong's.<br>The Fang Heavenly Clan had lost this match.<br>Merely, they had never expected that they would suffer such a crushing defeat.<br>At the moment when Chu Feng appeared, they had originally thought that Fang Hualong would be able to defeat him. As for defeating Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son, it was naturally a great accomplishment for Fang Hualong.<br>It was only at that moment that they realized that their defeat was actually destined the moment Chu Feng appeared.<br>No matter how strong Fang Hualong was, he was actually&hellip; unable to even fight back against Chu Feng.<br>At that moment, they finally understood what Chu Feng meant by &lsquo;Half a cup of tea&rsquo;s worth of time would be enough&rsquo;, and why he thanked Fang Hualong for his reminder.<br>Indeed, if Fang Hualong had not told him about the time limit, Chu Feng would not have known that there was a time limit at all.<br>Indeed, half a cup of tea&rsquo;s worth of time was sufficient for Chu Feng.<br>In fact, Chu Feng had destroyed the Fang Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s advantage that they'd established in almost two hours instantly.<br></p></div>
