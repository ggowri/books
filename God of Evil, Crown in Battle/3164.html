        <div> - Great Opportunity To Make Friends<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although he had defeated the Burnfield Monstrous Clan and retrieved their Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s territory, Chu Feng knew very well that their true enemy was not the Burnfield Monstrous Clan or the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan.<br>Chu Feng knew very well what his purpose for being in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm was. He wasn't there to conquer the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm&rsquo;s Eastern Region. He was there to conquer the entire Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.<br>However, with war, there would inevitably be casualties. Should he be by himself, he would be able to move about at will.<br>However, how was he to ensure the safety of these brothers and sisters of his? That was the issue that had been perplexing Chu Feng the entire time.<br>Fortunately, Chu Feng had discovered a solution to the problem.<br>Chu Feng had discovered this solution after arriving in the main city.<br>That was also the reason why Chu Feng would not let the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen escape, and why he was so ruthless and uninviting toward the guests invited by the Burnfield Monstrous Clan.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng had discovered the way to protect his clansmen. That was the reason why he was not afraid of the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen seeking out the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan to get revenge for them.<br>As for the method that Chu Feng had discovered, it was to activate the main city&rsquo;s grand formation.<br>An extremely powerful defensive formation was hidden within the main city. While others might not know about its existence, Chu Feng managed to detect it instantly.<br>Chu Feng had not detected it through any sort of observational ability. Instead, it was merely intuition. After he approached the city, Chu Feng felt very strongly that it was there.<br>Although Chu Feng still hadn&rsquo;t found the formation core of that grand defensive formation, he firmly believed that he would be able to find it, and that all of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen would be safe in there should he activate it.<br>Thus, Chu Feng did not immediately celebrate like the other Chu Heavenly Clansmen after driving out the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen, and instead began to search for the grand defensive formation&rsquo;s core.<br>Furthermore, Chu Feng had already discovered some clues. As for his clues, they too were from his intuition.<br>That said, Chu Feng had no idea that there were two individuals that were secretly observing him while he was trying his hardest to search for the grand defensive formation&rsquo;s core.<br>As for those two individuals, they were naturally the Dongguo Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Mighty Dongguo Duo.<br>The two of them had been secretly following Chu Feng the entire time, and had witnessed everything he had done.<br>&ldquo;This Chu Feng is truly remarkable. Ignoring his talent in martial cultivation, merely his courage, insight and leadership ability are already enough to separate him from mere commoners,&rdquo; the elder of the Dongguo Mighty Duo said.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, judging by your tone, you&rsquo;re planning to help him?&rdquo; The younger of the Dongguo Mighty Duo asked.<br>&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; The elder asked.<br>&ldquo;Someone like him, even without our Dongguo Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s assistance, will definitely be able to mature to greatness in the future.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since we are able to help him during the time when we can, why shouldn&rsquo;t we help him?&rdquo; The younger brother asked.<br>Hearing those words, the elder brother smiled. At that moment, the Dongguo Mighty Duo had made a firm resolution to protect Chu Feng and the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>The reason for that was because the two of them both firmly believed that Chu Feng would be able to stir the equilibrium of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm in the future. To befriend Chu Feng at a time like this would be the most optimal timing. If they did not befriend Chu Feng now, they would likely forever miss the opportunity to do so.<br>Suddenly, the younger brother asked, &ldquo;Big brother, do you think that Chu Feng will be able to reach the level of that Wuma Shengjie?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Wuma Shengjie is indeed a top level character. A genius of his level is extremely rare. Furthermore, I firmly believe that Wuma Shengjie will become renowned throughout the entire Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm in the future.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for now, Wuma Shengjie is already leaving his mark on the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. He has also successfully led the Wuma Heavenly Clan into the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm&rsquo;s Overlord Region. That already proves how powerful he is.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although Chu Feng possesses very strong potential, it&rsquo;s hard to say whether or not he can reach Wuma Shengjie&rsquo;s level,&rdquo; the elder of the Dongguo Mighty Duo said.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, Wuma Shengjie is very strong.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard from our brothers that have just entered the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm that Exalted Heavenly Fate made a prophecy. He prophesied that an exceptional genius would appear out of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm&rsquo;s eastern region. As for that genius, he is capable of contending against Linghu Hongfei.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The people outside are practically all certain that the genius that will be able to contend against Linghu Hongfei in the future is Wuma Shengjie,&rdquo; the younger of the Dongguo Mighty Duo said.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve also heard about that matter,&rdquo; the elder of the Dongguo Mighty Duo said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, big brother, what do you think? Would that exceptional genius be Wuma Shengjie? Will Wuma Shengjie really be able to become a genius capable of contending against Linghu Hongfei in the future?&rdquo; The younger asked.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m unable to answer that question for you. After all, both you and I know very well how frightening of a character that Linghu Hongfei is. He&rsquo;s simply on a different level from all the other people of the younger generation. If you are to ask me who would be able to become as powerful as him, I am truly unable to imagine anyone,&rdquo; the elder of the Dongguo Mighty Duo said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; the younger of the Dongguo Mighty Duo nodded in agreement.<br>The two of them had met Linghu Hongfei, the strongest genius of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, the existence said to be able to surpass Chu Xuanyuan, before entering the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.<br>It was precisely because they had met him before that they had such a deep impression of him. After all, Linghu Hongfei was simply so powerful that he overwhelmed the two of them with intimidation at first glance.<br>&ldquo;Hey, why did Chu Feng enter that room and never come back out?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Is he not going to celebrate with his clan&rsquo;s brothers and sisters?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the Dongguo Mighty Duo turned their gazes to the main city again.<br>The reason for that was because they had noticed that Chu Feng had entered a palace and did not leave. As for that palace, it just so happened to be guarded by a special formation. As such, they were unable to see what Chu Feng was doing inside.<br>&ldquo;That Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t possibly be tired, and have decided to take a rest, right?&rdquo; The younger of the Dongguo Mighty Duo asked.<br>&ldquo;That shouldn&rsquo;t be the case,&rdquo; the elder said.<br>&ldquo;Should I go in and investigate?&rdquo; The younger asked.<br>&ldquo;Let it be. It&rsquo;s better that we don&rsquo;t approach him too closely. Although he&rsquo;s only a rank eight Heavenly Immortal, he&rsquo;s an Exalted-cloak World Spiritist. His perception is not something that ordinary people could compare with. If we are to get too close to him, he might be able to detect us,&rdquo; the elder said.<br>&ldquo;So what if he manages to detect us? Don&rsquo;t tell me we&rsquo;re afraid of being detected by him?&rdquo; The younger spoke disapprovingly.<br>However, he soon asked, &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right. Big brother, since we&rsquo;ve already decided to help him, why are we still concealing ourselves? Why don&rsquo;t we show ourselves to him?&rdquo;<br></p></div>
