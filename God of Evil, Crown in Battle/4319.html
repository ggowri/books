        <h1>Chapter 4318</h1>
        <div> - Dragon Vein Source<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Precisely because of how exceptionally powerful the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was, Chu Feng was not at all worried about him entering the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s palace that was filled with experts.<br>Chu Feng felt that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist will definitely be able to return safely.<br>Sure enough, after roughly an hour, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist exited that palace.<br>Not only did he return safely, he was also in high spirits.<br>He was smiling so joyously that his face was completely covered in wrinkles like a steamed bun.<br>&ldquo;Well then, my good disciple, perhaps it&rsquo;s the will of heaven. We are able to enter the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Ground,&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist joyously.<br>&ldquo;Master, you&rsquo;ve determined the way to enter it?&rdquo; Chu Feng was also exceptionally glad to hear those words.<br>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; The Ox-nosed Old Daoist shook his head.<br>&ldquo;Ah? No?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Master, then why did you say those words?&rdquo; Chu Feng was confused.<br>&ldquo;We are going to enter the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Ground openly. The Dragon Clansmen will bring us in there,&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll bring us in there?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Master, exactly what is going on?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng grew even more confused.<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist did not answer him directly. Instead, he started to smile in a deliberately mystifying manner.<br>&ldquo;Master, just tell me what it is,&rdquo; Chu Feng urged impatiently.<br>Being urged by Chu feng, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist finally said, &ldquo;Do you still remember there are various announcements posted inside and outside the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s territory of their desire to invite reputable world spiritists to stay as guests in the Dragon Clan? Furthermore, those world spiritists would be greatly rewarded.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Chu Feng had a deep impression of that matter.<br>Those announcements were all quite new. It seemed quite urgent.<br>When he first saw the announcements, Chu Feng felt that the Dragon Clan might have something important that they needed the help of powerful world spiritists. Furthermore, it was an urgent matter.<br>Else, a power like the Dragon Clan should be able to request the aid of even someone like the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted.<br>There was no reason for them to offer rewards to attract world spiritists to their Dragon Clan.<br>&ldquo;Master, did something major happened in the Dragon Clan?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Correct. Something major happened,&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>Then, Chu Feng listened to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s explanation and roughly learned what was going on.<br>Apart from the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Ground, there was another very important place within the Dragon Clan.<br>That place was called the Dragon Vein Source.<br>The Dragon Vein Source was a place not even the Dragon Clansmen were capable of opening.<br>But, it was said that the Dragon Vein Source contained great power. Furthermore, that power could provide enormous aid to the Dragon Clansmen.<br>A legend has been passed down through the Dragon Clan.<br>If the Dragon Vein Source was to open one day, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s strength will inevitably advance by leaps and bounds.<br>In fact, it was even rumored that the reason why the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s first clan chief established their Dragon Clan here was because of that Dragon Vein Source.<br>In other words, the Dragon Vein Source has existed longer than even the Dragon Clan.<br>As for the saying that the Dragon Clan will advance by leaps and bounds should the Dragon Vein Source open, it was something that their first clan chief said.<br>While the Dragon Vein Source has never once open in the years the Dragon Clan has been established here and the Dragon Clansmen had never once received any benefits from that Dragon Vein Source, the Dragon Clansmen believed in their forefathers&rsquo; teachings and never dared to disregard that Dragon Vein Source.<br>The Dragon Clan had regarded the Dragon Vein Source as a place of utmost important the entire time.<br>In fact, they&rsquo;ve guarded the Dragon Vein Source as tightly as the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Ground.<br>Days ago, the Dragon Vein Source finally showed abnormality.<br>This immediately caught the full attention of the Dragon Clan. It was said that even the elders in closed-door training all exited their training.<br>Through the observation of the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s experts, they&rsquo;ve come to a conclusion.<br>They&rsquo;ve determined that now was possibly the most probable time that the Dragon Vein Source will open in the history of their Dragon Clan&rsquo;s establishment in this place.<br>But, they needed the guidance of powerful world spiritists in order to open the Dragon Vein Source.<br>If they missed this opportunity, it would be very difficult for it to come again.<br>Furthermore, this opportunity was very fleeting. No one knew how long it would remain.<br>That was the reason why there were a large number of world spiritists gathered in and out of the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s territory.<br>As time was extremely urgent, they simply had no time to seek out powerful world spiritists to come to their aid.<br>They could only utilize what they can to attract the help of the powerful world spiritists that were in the vicinity of their Dragon Clan.<br>&ldquo;Master, are you planning to help them open that Dragon Vein Source with the condition that the two of us are allowed to enter the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Ground?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;As expected of my good disciple. You&rsquo;re quick-witted,&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;But, didn&rsquo;t you say that the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Ground was a place of utmost importance to the Dragon Clan? Would they be willing to allow the two of us, outsiders, to enter it?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;They will not be willing to let go of this opportunity,&rdquo; Compared to Chu Feng, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was extremely confident.<br>Then, Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist arrived outside the Dragon Clan. They tore down a random announcement call poster before showing up at the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s entrance.<br>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You dared to come to our Dragon Clan? Scram.&rdquo;<br>But, after Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist revealed their purpose in coming, they were not only obstructed by the Dragon Clansmen, they were also being driven away.<br>It seemed like the Dragon Clansmen standing guard simply did not believe Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist to be world spiritists.<br>&ldquo;Is this how your Dragon Clan treats your guests?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a stern voice. His attitude was also very vile.<br>It would be one thing if he was the only one being humiliated. He would be able to endure it.<br>But, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was not his master. How could Chu Feng tolerate people humiliating his master?<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s word immediately incurred the dissatisfaction from the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s guards.<br>Already impatient and annoyed with them, the guards began to look at Chu Feng with killing intent in their eyes.<br>&ldquo;What sort of place did you think this to be?! This is the Dragon Clan!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is no place for mere ants to behave atrociously!&rdquo;<br>As the guard spoke, he walked toward Chu Feng. While he did not unleash his oppressive might, one could tell that he was not planning to let Chu Feng get away.<br>At this moment, the surrounding crowd all had looks of joy as they watched the calamity that was about to befall Chu Feng.<br>They were all waiting for Chu Feng to be taught a lesson by the Dragon Clansmen.<br>&ldquo;Cease your hand!&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, a voice suddenly sounded.<br>Hearing that voice, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s guard that was about to attach Chu Feng started trembling in fear.<br>Chu Feng also turned toward the voice. Upon doing so, his expression changed.<br>The person who spoke was an acquaintance of his!<br></p></div>
