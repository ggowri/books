        <h1>Chapter 4248</h1>
        <div> - Outcome Determined<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The power released from the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation was extremely terrifying. It was a power that was stronger than rank two Utmost Exalteds.<br>It was a power hundreds of times stronger than the power of Chu Feng&rsquo;s grand slaughtering formation.<br>Yet, it just so happened that that power had changed direction, and was moving to attack Lu Jie instead.<br>&ldquo;Was it Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Did he manipulate that power?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, that&rsquo;s clearly the power from the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How was he able to manipulate it?&rdquo;<br>Everyone realized that it was Chu Feng who had altered the direction of the attack.<br>But they were unable to understand how Chu Feng had done it.<br>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo;<br>Seeing that the situation was bad, Lu Jie immediately increased his control of the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation.<br>With that, the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation opened its mouth even wider. The suction power emitted by it then grew even stronger.<br>With that, the attack that had been sent back toward it started being devoured by the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation.<br>But, even with that being the case, Lu Jie was unable to smile.<br>&ldquo;What sort of despicable trick did you use?&rdquo;<br>With his brows narrowed, Lu Jie glowered at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Despicable trick?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng revealed a contemptuous smile. He felt Lu Jie to be truly hilarious.<br>&ldquo;If you didn't use a despicable trick, how could you possibly accomplish such a thing?&rdquo; Lu Jie was still unwilling to accept reality.<br>He refused to believe that Chu Feng was able to use ordinary means to control the power that had been unleashed by his spirit formation.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still unable to understand?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng smiled again. Then, Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand seals changed again. He actually retrieved the elemental energies. The power of the elemental energies that had entered the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation actually began to rush out from its mouth.<br>Even though the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation was clearly emitting a terrifying suction, it was unable to devour Chu Feng&rsquo;s elemental energy. Instead, the elemental energies were rushing out from it.<br>Soon, all the elemental energy that devoured by the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation had rushed out of its mouth.<br>Seeing this, the crowd were all struck dumb.<br>Then, Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand seals changed again. He lightly shouted, &ldquo;Formation, reveal yourself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Boom---&rdquo;<br>In the next instant, the power of Chu Feng&rsquo;s slaughtering formation increased by multiple folds. It was like a volcanic eruption.<br>Adding the power that had accumulated previously, the power of Chu Feng&rsquo;s slaughtering formation had reached an unimaginably terrifying level.<br>The five elemental powers of wind, lightning, water, fire and earth gathered together to form a giant creature tens of thousands of meters tall.<br>Surging flames, devastating lightning, rushing waters and violent winds covered that giant creature.<br>Before that giant creature, Lu Jie&rsquo;s Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation was reduced to insignificance by comparison.<br>It was like a small hill being placed at the foot of a mountain.<br>It was like an ant standing before a lion.<br>Most importantly, Lu Jie began utilizing his full strength upon noticing that the situation had turned bad for him.<br>Under his full strength, the suction emitted by the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation had reached an unprecedented level.<br>The mountains in the distance began crumbling. The earth beneath his feet also started shattering. Even the clouds far away were being sucked in.<br>It seemed like everything in the world was about to be sucked into its mouth. That was truly a giant creature capable of devouring the heavens.<br>Yet, it just so happened that the giant beast composed of five elemental energies that stood closest to the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation was completely unaffected by it.<br>The Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation that was able to devour everything was akin to an empty display now. It was unable to affect Chu Feng&rsquo;s slaughtering formation at all.<br>&ldquo;Is this... the true power of Chu Feng&rsquo;s slaughtering formation?&rdquo;<br>Seeing the power displayed by the two spirit formations, the crowd finally realized the vast disparity between them.<br>&ldquo;Lu Jie, do you understand now?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is the disparity between our spirit formations. It is also the disparity between you and I,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Lu Jie.<br>He still had a smile on his face, still standing in the same place with a look of contempt. Chu Feng have had that attitude the entire time, never once changing in his confrontation against Lu Jie.<br>But, when the crowd looked at him again, they felt a complete upheaval in their hearts, a complete transformation.<br>At that moment, victory was leaning in Chu Feng's favor.<br>Furthermore, it had been in Chu Feng&rsquo;s favor the entire time.<br>It was just that the crowd had only just realized how powerful Chu Feng, that youngster that had appeared for the first time was.<br>Lu Jie had been defeated.<br>He had been utterly defeated.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s performance had completely won over the crowd.<br>Lu Jie did not become weaker. He was still as powerful as before.<br>Unfortunately, he had encountered a true monster.<br>That monster would change Lu Jie&rsquo;s status.<br>That monster would replace Lu Jie as the actual strongest world spiritist of the Holy Light Galaxy&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill you!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Lu Jie shouted furiously.<br>He was still unwilling to accept reality, and put forth a final struggle.<br>But, he did not attack with his spirit formation. Rather, he moved his hand to remove the Dragon Restriction Bracelets.<br>&ldquo;Roar---&rdquo;<br>However, right when his movements were exposed, before he could remove the Dragon Restriction Bracelets from his wrists, the five elemental energies rushed toward him.<br>The giant beast had arrived before Lu Jie in an instant. With devastating power, it moved to oppress him.<br>&ldquo;Woosh---&rdquo;<br>But, at the moment of imminent peril, over twenty figures arrived before Lu Jie, shielding him behind them.<br>Acting together at the same time, the power unleashed by those people far surpassed that of a rank two Utmost Exalted.<br>Before such power, no matter how powerful Chu Feng&rsquo;s slaughtering formation was, it was no match. In an instant, the giant beast had crumbled.<br>Those twenty-plus individuals were all disciples of the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted. They were all Lu Jie&rsquo;s senior brothers and sisters.<br>The strongest among them had not only grasped rank four Dragon Transformation Sensation, he was also a rank eight Utmost Exalted.<br>He was the second strongest disciple of the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted, beneath only the All-seeing Heavenly Master.<br>His name was Ouyang Wending.<br>Ouyang Wending did not immediately pull back his attack after destroying Chu Feng&rsquo;s grand slaughtering formation. Instead, he controlled his rank eight Utmost Exalted-level oppressive might to press toward Chu Feng.<br>Although the oppressive might was intangible, it concealed murderous desires.<br>That Ouyang Wending intended to kill Chu Feng!<br>But, before his oppressive might could even reach Chu Feng, it dissipated into thin air.<br>Following that, a figure appeared before Chu Feng.<br>It was Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;Ouyang Wending, could it be that you all are planning to act like sore losers?&rdquo; Grandmaster Tang Chen asked sternly after neutralizing Ouyang Wending&rsquo;s attack.<br>&ldquo;That child attempted to kill my junior brother. He has committed a capital offense,&rdquo; said Ouyang Wending.<br>&ldquo;Capital offense?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Who do you think you are? Since when were you able to determine the life and death of others?&rdquo; asked Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;Tang Chen, step aside immediately. Otherwise&hellip; do not blame me for being rude.&rdquo;<br>Ouyang Wending was not afraid of Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>Even though he knew that his strength was no match for Grandmaster Tang Chen's, he still wasn't afraid.<br>Of course, his confidence did not come from his own strength.<br>Everyone knew that his confidence originated from his master, the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted.<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen raised his brows. A look of displeasure appeared on his face. &ldquo;This old man will give you one last chance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Scram out of this old man&rsquo;s sight right now. Or else, I will have your life.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Tang Chen, are you really planning to go against my master?&rdquo;<br>Sure enough, Ouyang Wending brought up his master&rsquo;s name.<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen didn&rsquo;t answer him. Yet, he had released his oppressive might.<br>Not only that, but his oppressive might also contained boundless killing intent.<br>The bystanders were all unable to sense anything.<br>Only Lu Jie, Ouyang Wending and their fellow disciples felt like they&rsquo;d fallen into a vortex of death.<br>Should that vortex spin in the slightest, all of them would die.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Seeing that, Ouyang Wending finally narrowed his brows.<br>Then, he turned around and led Lu Jie and his other junior brothers and sisters and flew away.<br></p></div>
