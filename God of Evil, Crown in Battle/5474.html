        <h1>Chapter 5474: Such Price</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>Soon, the Armory Hall&rsquo;s walls began to glow brightly.</span><br><span>Spirit power flowed out from the walls and flooded the main hall. It morphed into massive dragon chains that dived into the sealing formation to reinforce it. As a result, the silhouette of the silver dragon faded.</span><br><span>Even so, more and more dragon chains were steadily added to sealing formation, strengthening it to no end.</span><br><span>Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes narrowed as he raised his head and looked at the sky. He couldn&rsquo;t see what was happening outside from the Armory Hall, but he could fathom a guess.</span><br><span>&ldquo;The Silver Dragon Spear must be extremely important to the Totem Dragon Clan if they are going to such an extent,&rdquo; Chu Feng remarked.</span><br><span>After the sealing formation had been reinforced, the Silver Dragon Spear was no longer able to manifest its silhouette. It was clear that the Silver Dragon Spear wouldn&rsquo;t be able to break through the formation anymore. The Totem Dragon Clan had chosen to bear a heavy price in order to stop the Silver Dragon Spear from </span><span>acknowledging Chu Feng as its master.</span><br><span>Upon seeing this, Long Xu slowly lowered his palm. He knew that he didn&rsquo;t have a make a move anymore.</span><br><span>Grar!</span><br><span>A piercing dragon&rsquo;s roar echoed from the sealing formation. It was the Silver Dragon Spear!</span><br><span>It didn&rsquo;t sound like a simple cry from a weapon but a true dragon&rsquo;s roar. It reverberated for a long while, causing all of the Divine Armaments inside the Armory Hall to tremble. Their bodies began glowing with peculiar runes.</span><br><span>The light faded along with the final echo of the roar, but the runes continued to linger on those Divine Armaments. At the same time, the Divine Armaments fell back onto their chairs as if they had lost their strength, showing none of the majesty they had displayed earlier.</span><br><span>Soon, the spirit power started to dissipate too, but the Silver Dragon Spear still remained tightly chained up. The glowing runes on the chains made it clear how powerful the sealing formation was.</span><br><span>Long Xu heaved a sigh of relief before leaving the Armory Hall. The other elders of the Totem Dragon Clan were waiting for him outside with horrified looks.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What happened, Lord Long Xu?&rdquo; they asked with trembling voices.</span><br><span>These were all experts who had weathered many storms, but how could they not be worried when the colossal formation protecting this realm had visibly darkened?</span><br><span>&ldquo;Wait for me at our clan&rsquo;s Main Palace.&rdquo;</span><br><span>The Dragon Clan Main Palace was a place where only people who had reached a certain level of standing could enter. This implicitly conveyed to the elders that this was a confidential matter. As Long Xu was the one who called the shots in the Totem Dragon Clan in the absence of the clan chief, the other elders followed his orders and headed to the Dragon Clan Main Palace.</span><br><span>However, Long Xu didn&rsquo;t immediately head to the Dragon Clan Main Palace but instead took a detour to the back of the Armory Hall, where an underground palace was located.</span><br><span>This underground palace was usually guarded by an army of over a thousand people, but there was only one person standing at the entrance.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Long Xu.&rdquo; That person bowed to Long Xu.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Long Shou?&rdquo; Long Xu asked angrily.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Long Shou is inside,&rdquo; the person replied.</span><br><span>Long Xu furiously kicked open the door to the underground palace as he bellowed, &ldquo;Useless thing. I gave you control of our Great Clan Protection Formation and a million of our elites, but you can&rsquo;t even curb a Silver Dragon Spear. What use do I have for you?&rdquo;</span><br><span>He was so infuriated that he began cursing even while making his way through the underground palace. However, when he reached its innermost area and kicked open a huge door, what he saw silenced him.</span><br><span>Inside the door was not just a palace but a vast space reminiscent of a realm. There were no mountains, streams, or greenery in this realm, just a barren desert with a </span><span>humongous ball of light that extended from the ground to the sky.</span><br><span>This ball of light was a formation core.</span><br><span>Over a million people dressed in peculiar robes were standing beneath the formation core. These people were highly skilled world spiritists nurtured by the Totem Dragon Clan or were guest elders. There were chains tied to their bodies, connecting them to the formation core.</span><br><span>Yet, these million world spiritists were all lying weakly on the ground. None of them had the strength to even remain seated. Those who got off lightly were desperately gasping for air. Those whose conditions were more severe had fainted and were bleeding from their mouth, eyes, noses, and ears. Some had even stopped breathing or exploded altogether.</span><br><span>With just a brief glance, Long Xu could tell that at least a hundred thousand people had died, and over eight hundred thousand people were severely injured. Only a small handful got away with light injuries, and there was no one who was unharmed.</span><br><span>Long Xu quickly made his way toward one of the elders and helped him up.</span><br><span>This was the elder who had previously reported about Chu Feng to Long Xu, as well as the one working to hinder the Silver Dragon Spear from acknowledging Chu Feng as its master.</span><br><span>His name was Long Shou.</span><br><span>He was also severely injured, which shouldn&rsquo;t have been the case considering his cultivation and strength. This showed that he had really tried his best.</span><br><span>&ldquo;L-lord Long Xu, I have followed your orders and done everything I could to stop the Silver Dragon Spear. However, I have disappointed you with my incompetence. I am willing to bear the responsibility for my failure,&rdquo; Long Shousaid before passing out.</span><br><span>He had only held on thus far to relay these words.</span><br><span>Long Xu quickly reached into his Cosmos Sack and took out a handful of glowing golden pills. He crushed the pills and scattered them over the crowd like golden rain. These were invaluable pills, but they did little to improve the crowd&rsquo;s conditions.</span><br><span>Long Xu was dazed. He had known that they would have to pay a price for stopping the Silver Dragon Spear, but he didn&rsquo;t think that the price would be this hefty.</span><br></p></div>
