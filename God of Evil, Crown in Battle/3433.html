        <div> - Unable To Escape The Calamity<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? What&rsquo;s with that expression?&rdquo; Gong Qing stared at Chu Feng with her beautiful eyes.<br>&ldquo;Nothing. My expression is very natural,&rdquo; Chu Feng hurriedly adjusted himself and revealed a perfect smile of pretense.<br>Gong Qing looked at Chu Feng like she was looking at a fool and rolled her eyes. She said, &ldquo;What about you? What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young lady, regarding that&hellip; is it fine if I don&rsquo;t mention it?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;What? Is your name so unpleasant to hear that you don&rsquo;t wish to mention it to others?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Names are all given by one&rsquo;s parents, how could you fear someone laughing at your name?&rdquo; Gong Qing looked at Chu Feng with contempt.<br>The reason why Chu Feng did not wish to give his name was naturally because of Gong Qing&rsquo;s older sister, Gong Mingyue.<br>Chu Feng did not wish to reveal himself because he did not wish to have any connection with that Gong Mingyue.<br>However, after hearing what Gong Qing said, Chu Feng felt her words to be very reasonable.<br>The name Chu Feng was given to him by his parents. Although he didn&rsquo;t know if it was his father or his mother that gave him the name, it was not at all a shameful name.<br>On the contrary, Chu Feng was very proud of his name.<br>As the saying went, one should be proud of one&rsquo;s name and stand by one&rsquo;s actions. That was precisely what it meant.<br>No matter how many reasons there might be, one should not conceal one&rsquo;s name.<br>This was even more so since it was merely a ridiculous wedding arrangement. Chu Feng merely did not wish to associate himself with it. It wasn&rsquo;t like he was afraid of anything.<br>Not to mention an arranged marriage made in a joking manner, even if it were made seriously, no one would be able to stop Chu Feng should he wish to cancel the arrangement.<br>Thinking of that, Chu Feng gained confidence. He straightened his chest and raised his head. Without hesitation, he said, &ldquo;Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng?&rdquo; Sure enough, upon hearing the name Chu Feng, Gong Qing&rsquo;s expression grew stiff. She began to ponder it. It was only after a long while that she said with a soft voice, &ldquo;Why does that name sound so familiar?&rdquo;<br>However, Gong Qing evidently only felt Chu Feng&rsquo;s name to be familiar-sounding, and did not possess a deep impression of it. Otherwise, it would be impossible for her to not be able to recall who Chu Feng was.<br>As for Chu Feng, he merely smiled. He was not so bored as to call Gong Qing&rsquo;s attention to who he was. He wouldn&rsquo;t tell Gong Qing that he was her future brother-in-law.<br>Although the spirit formations Chu Feng had taught Gong Qing were very complicated, they were actually quite simple to set up should one learn the secret to them.<br>Chu Feng had also left the secret to his spirit formations in their outlines. Thus, Gong Qing did not have to be fully concentrated when setting them up.<br>As Chu Feng and Gong Qing chatted, Chu Feng learned about the hedgehog.<br>Gong Qing had no idea what sort of species the hedgehog was. It was something that she had encountered by chance at a mountain that had existed since the Ancient Era.<br>When Gong Qing encountered the hedgehog, she was only a small child. Thus, it could be said that the hedgehog had grown up together with her, and as such, it was very important to her.<br>Following the treatment method indicated by Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formation, the seriously-ill hedgehog soon began to recover.<br>Seeing that, Gong Qing began to wholeheartedly focus on healing the hedgehog.<br>In the end, the semi-unconscious hedgehog regained full consciousness.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you are truly amazing. My Lil&rsquo; Thorn actually really managed to&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Gong Qing was overjoyed. She turned around and wanted to express her thanks to Chu Feng.<br>However, upon turning around, she discovered that Chu Feng had disappeared.<br>&ldquo;This guy&hellip; why would he leave already?&rdquo;<br>After verifying that Chu Feng had left, Gong Qing revealed an expression of regret.<br>&hellip;...<br>As for Chu Feng, he had verified that the hedgehog would be able to attain a full recovery when its situation changed for the better. As such, he decided to leave without saying good-bye.<br>The reason why Chu Feng was so urgent to leave was because he had something that he must do. He must return to the Ice Summit. He planned to explain what had happened that day to Grandmaster Long Xuan and Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>Furthermore, Chu Feng felt that, in addition to his spirit power that was already sealed, his cultivation was also starting to be sealed.<br>The power of the backlash was even more frightening than he had anticipated. In that sort of situation, his cultivation would, sooner or later, be completely sealed. At that time, he would become someone without cultivation.<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t know why this was happening. As such, he wanted to ask Grandmaster Liangqiu and the others.<br>Chu Feng was flying in the sky. However, he only flew for a short while before his attention was caught by a scene below.<br>There was a group of people surrounding a single person. As for the person that was surrounded&hellip; it was someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>As for the people that had surrounded that Chu Heavenly Clansman, they were from another Heavenly Clan, the Xu Heavenly Clan.<br>It was the same Heavenly Clan that had clashed with Chu Feng on the way to the Ice Summit that day.<br>The Chu Heavenly Clansman that was being surrounded had the appearance of a middle-aged man. However, he should be more than a thousand years old.<br>Unfortunately, his cultivation was very unimpressive. At his age, his cultivation was only that of a rank one Heavenly Immortal. As for those Xu Heavenly Clansmen that had surrounded him, any one of them had a cultivation surpassing his.<br>Apart from the Xu Heavenly Clansmen and that Chu Heavenly Clansman, there were also a lot of people gathered in the surroundings.<br>Those people were from all different powers. At that moment, they were watching everything like they were watching a show that was about to unfold.<br>If the ones below were from other Heavenly Clans, Chu Feng would not bother to pay attention at all. However, since it was a Chu Heavenly Clansman, Chu Feng would not watch and remain indifferent.<br>Thus, Chu Feng stopped in midair and looked downward. He wanted to see exactly what was going on.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, we possess neither grievances or hatred, why would you all suddenly attack me?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, that middle-aged Chu Heavenly Clansman had received some light injuries. Fortunately, those injuries were not serious. However, faced with the situation he was in, he had a flustered expression on his face. It could be seen that he was very afraid.<br>Seeing the middle-aged man acting like that, the Xu Heavenly Clansmen all revealed ridiculing smiles.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all because you&rsquo;re someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan. You&rsquo;re destined to meet a calamity by running into us.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the middle-aged man was very surprised. The bystanders were also surprised.<br>They had never heard of there being any sort of conflict between the Chu Heavenly Clan and the Xu Heavenly Clan. However, judging from the current situation, it seemed that some sort of conflict had indeed occurred between the two clans.<br>Since they were hostile powers, it would mean that&hellip; the middle-aged man was destined to be unable to escape a calamity.<br></p></div>
