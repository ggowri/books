        <h1>Chapter 4374</h1>
        <div>: I&rsquo;ll Return It Severalfold<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;You bastard, what did you do? How did you overwrite my control over the formation?&rdquo; the guest elder yelled feebly but indignantly.<br>His widened eyes were filled with bewilderment.<br>&ldquo;Do you still not get it? I&rsquo;ll do you a favor and fulfill your curiosity so that you can die without any regrets then!&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, the massive dragon made out of spirit power began to emanate a unique aura. It was the same aura as Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spiritist bloodline.<br>The power of the world spiritist bloodline was fused fundamentally with the dragon, such that it was impossible to sever from one from the other.<br>&ldquo;Y-you&hellip; You&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The guest elder found himself at a loss of words.<br>In truth, he already had an inkling about what had happened, but it was just that he couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to believe it. However, with the evidence shoved right into his face, he had no choice but to accept it.<br>Chu Feng had used his world spiritist bloodline to take complete control of the main formation.<br>Even though he had known all this while that Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spiritist bloodline was formidable, he didn&rsquo;t think that it would be possible for anyone to forcefully take control of a formation using their bloodline.<br>Not to mention, this formation was something that was constructed personally by the sectmaster of the Soaring Flower Gazebo!<br>&ldquo;I know that you won&rsquo;t spare me, so I won&rsquo;t lower my pride to beg you for mercy. However, in view that we&rsquo;re all world spiritist, I hope that you can tell me one thing so that I can die in peace,&rdquo; the guest elder said.<br>&ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Who in the world are you, and where did you come from?&rdquo;<br>As the guest elder spoke, his eyes were completely fixated on Chu Feng.<br>He was extremely curious as to just what kind of background Chu Feng had to actually possess such powerful blood spiritist bloodline.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>But upon hearing that question, Chu Feng simply chuckled to himself, not saying anything at all.<br>&ldquo;Why are you laughing?&rdquo; the guest elder asked with a frown.<br>He could sense something ominous coming from Chu Feng&rsquo;s reaction.<br>&ldquo;Why am I laughing? I&rsquo;m laughing at how even a despicable person like you dares to ask a favor of me. You aren&rsquo;t worthy of knowing who I am and where I come from!&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng waved his sleeves grandly.<br>Shoosh shoosh shoosh!<br>The Cosmos Sack of the guest elder, along with all of the treasures on him, all flew into Chu Feng&rsquo;s hands.<br>Whoosh!<br>Following that, the massive dragon formed out of spirit power descended from the sky and swiped at the guest elder with its sharp claws.<br>This swipe crushed the guest elder&rsquo;s dantian and pierced through his soul, destroying his psyche.<br>&ldquo;AHHHH!&rdquo;<br>The guest elder let loose a heart-wrenching cry.<br>He knew that Chu Feng was destroying both his cultivation and his spirit power.<br>Even though he knew that Chu Feng would never spare him, he still couldn&rsquo;t help but cower in the face of death. Overwhelmed with fear, the spunk that he had shown before vanished. He began begging Chu Feng for mercy.<br>&ldquo;Young hero, please let me off! I&rsquo;ll give you everything I have accumulated over my long life! I know that I was wrong to have tried to assimilate you, but you still managed to get the treasure in the end! Since you got what you came for, please show some mercy and let me off just this once&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The guest elder bawled as he begged for Chu Feng&rsquo;s mercy desperately, but it was as if the latter couldn&rsquo;t hear anything at all.<br>To Chu Feng, letting the guest elder go wasn&rsquo;t an option at all.<br>After all, this old fellow had harmed so many lives and even tried to kill him too.<br>&ldquo;You should save your tears for later on. We&rsquo;ve barely gotten started over here. You&rsquo;ll have plenty to cry for later on.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng said those words, he raised his hand, and the guest elder began floating upward along with his hand movement.<br>He tossed the guest elder into the copper cauldron and began infusing it with the power of assimilation to break him down.<br>But this time around, Chu Feng had tampered with the copper cauldron so as to ensure that the guest elder wouldn&rsquo;t die too quickly.<br>He would repay the pain that he had gone through earlier a thousand times over back to the guest elder. He wanted the guest elder to taste the most grievous of suffering before finally dying in the midst of despair.<br>&ldquo;Ahhh! You bastard, you won&rsquo;t die an easy death! I won&rsquo;t let you off even as a ghost! AHHHHHH! KILL ME! JUST KILL ME!!!&rdquo;<br>The guest elder&rsquo;s cries of agony reverberated loudly within the cauldron, and it was so piercing that it left goosebumps rising on one&rsquo;s hand.<br>He knew that there was no more hope for him, so he began cursing and insulting Chu Feng furiously.<br>However, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t feel intimidated or infuriated to hear those words. Instead, he found them laughable.<br>Cultivators always spoke with their strength.<br>If the guest elder could only respond with the pain Chu Feng was inflicting on him with vulgarities, that only meant that he was utterly powerless.<br>After dealing with the guest elder, Chu Feng glanced at the various living beings lying all around the formation core.<br>Weng!<br>With a mere thought from Chu Feng, a massive formation gate appeared right before him. This formation gate led straight outside of the mountain range, beyond the reach of the Soaring Flower Gazebo.<br>After opening the formation gate, Chu Feng released the bindings placed on the living beings who still had a breath in them.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, milord.&rdquo;<br>Other than natural oddities, there were also monstrous beasts of all different cultivation levels too. These monstrous beasts possessed sentience that was on the same level as normal cultivators.<br>They understood that it was Chu Feng who had saved them, so they kneeled onto the ground and kowtowed grandly to Chu Feng.<br>They knew that if not for Chu Feng&rsquo;s help, they would have been sucked dry by the guest elder and become one of the many victims of the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s atrocities<br>&ldquo;Hurry up and leave. After you get out of here, run as far as you can. Don&rsquo;t get captured back in here,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>After he said those words, most of the living beings immediately ran toward the formation gate frenziedly, fearing that they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get away if they were to dawdle in the slightest.<br>However, not all of them were single-mindedly running away.<br>A slight wisp of light floated over to Chu Feng&rsquo;s side and asked, &ldquo;Milord, are you&hellip; not leaving?&rdquo;<br>This wisp of light was a natural oddity. Even though it had yet to fully mature, it had already gained sentience and intelligence.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s still something more that I need to do.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng quickly made his way out of the main formation, but he didn&rsquo;t leave this mountain range.<br>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>Nearly everyone who was in contact with the main formation were fooled by the exterior Chu Feng created. They honestly believed that the treasure was almost ready to be assimilated.<br>As such, the Supreme Elder and everyone that was inside a formation core infused all of their strength into the formation, hoping to get it done in one push.<br>As long as this matter were to succeed, they would become meritorious subjects of the Soaring Flower Gazebo.<br>However, there were also some exceptions, and they were the people who weren&rsquo;t inside a formation core, such as Ma Chengying and the other disciples.<br>They were still in the resting area from before.<br>Even though they usually acted like dignified and lofty immortals before mortals, in truth, they were despicable villains who committed all kinds of vile deeds for their pleasure.<br>Even during their rest time, they were still doing things that would have incurred the rage of anyone who had a conscience.<br>However, there were also a bunch of people who were circling around the disciple of the Supreme Elder, Li Rui, fawning on him.<br>As the personal disciple of the Supreme Elder, Li Rui was a cut above the rest of the disciples not just in terms of cultivation but in terms of standing as well.<br>If they could get on good terms with Li Rui, it would help them progress through the ranks within the sect.<br>Li Rui also welcomed their fawning too, and there was a smug smile on his face.<br>&ldquo;Yo, it looks like you are all still here?&rdquo;<br>All of a sudden, a voice broke the peacefulness in the resting area.<br></p></div>
