        <div> - The Person Who Could Save Me<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Chu Feng and others didn&rsquo;t wish to catch the attention of bystanders, they were concealed while returning to the Seven Suns Mountain Range.<br>But, once he saw Fumo Shaoyu and Fumo Xin&rsquo;er, Chu Feng immediately exposed himself and flew down.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, you really came. You&rsquo;ve arrived much sooner than I expected,&rdquo; Fumo Shaoyu had a look of joy upon seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s appearance.<br>&ldquo;Brother Shaoyu, Miss Xin&rsquo;er, what brought the two of you here?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How did you know that I&rsquo;ll be coming here?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng directly asked what he was confused by.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to worry about that. We&rsquo;re from the Demon Vanquishing Clan, after all. If we want to find someone, we have our own special abilities that will allow us to find that person,&rdquo; said Fumo Shaoyu.<br>Hearing that sort of response, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t bother to ask further.<br>Regardless of how Fumo Shaoyu found this place, he knew that Fumo Shaoyu was someone trustworthy.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, visitors are guests. If there&rsquo;s something to speak about, you should invite your friends inside to speak.&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen&rsquo;s voice sounded in Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears.<br>The Seven Suns Mountain Range was not a place that anyone could enter.<br>But, since they were Chu Feng&rsquo;s friends, they would naturally be welcomed.<br>After Grandmaster Tang Chen spoke, Chu Feng invited Fumo Shaoyu and Fumo Xin&rsquo;er to enter the Seven Suns Mountain Range as guests.<br>But, to his surprise, Fumo Shaoyu actually shook his head.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, I wouldn&rsquo;t be entering the Seven Suns Mountain Range.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I came here because I wanted to see you again and formally bid you farewell,&rdquo; said Fumo Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Formally bid me farewell?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Shaoyu, where are you two heading to?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re still not certain yet. But, we&rsquo;ve decided to leave the Holy Light Galaxy,&rdquo; said Fumo Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Leave the Holy Light Galaxy?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was surprised to hear those words. He had thought that Fumo Shaoyu and Fumo Xin&rsquo;er will try to understand the Holy Light Galaxy more and then train for a bit before leaving.<br>After all, even if they wanted to journey the world, they must possess sufficient cultivation to do so.<br>Of course, the reason why Chu Feng was thinking this way was because he didn&rsquo;t know that Fumo Shaoyu and Fumo Xin&rsquo;er were not siblings and even their surname was fake.<br>They were actually from the powerful Immortal Sea Fish Clan. Their actual names were Xianhai Shaoyu and Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er.<br>Their strength also surpassed Chu Feng&rsquo;s imagination.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s understanding of them was only at the level of their disguises.<br>He had no idea who they really were and what their real strengths were.<br>&ldquo;The world is enormous. We must go and look around. If I, Fumo Shaoyu, am going to journey through the world, I will definitely journey through the most powerful galaxy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, with your talent, you will leave this place sooner or later too.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;While the martial cultivation world is vast and boundless, I feel that we will definitely meet again.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do you know why I am so confident?&rdquo; Fumo Shaoyu asked as he patted Chu Feng&rsquo;s shoulder.<br>&ldquo;Brother Shaoyu, why are you so confident?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked curiously.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because there existed a peak for martial cultivators.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, only extremely few people are able to reach that peak.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I feel that I am capable of that. I also feel that brother Chu Feng is capable of that. At that sort of cultivation, the places that we will be heading toward will be the same. As such, it is only natural that we will meet again,&rdquo; said Fumo Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Now that you mention it, that&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng cannot deny what Fumo Shaoyu said to be somewhat reasonable.<br>While Chu Feng felt that the was still very weak and small right now, especially after having just met with that terrifying existence in the Misty Peak&rsquo;s ancient region, Chu Feng was confident that he will one day reach the martial cultivators&rsquo; summit.<br>After Fumo Shaoyu expressed his purpose in coming, he did not continue to chat with Chu Feng too much. Instead, he led Fumo Xin&rsquo;er and left just like that.<br>As for Chu Feng, he didn&rsquo;t bother to overthink things either. He followed Grandmaster Tang Chen and others and returned to the Seven Suns Mountain Range.<br>But, what Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t know was that Fumo Shaoyu and Fumo Xin&rsquo;er didn&rsquo;t really leave.<br>Instead, they secretly converged with Lady Gusu who was hidden in the shadows.<br>&ldquo;Young master, are you really going to open it?&rdquo;<br>Lady Gusu was looking at the black case in Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s hand. Unease filled her eyes.<br>That case was an artifact from the Ancient Era. It was something that was obtained by the Holy Light Clan.<br>Xianhai Shaoyu had snatched that case from the Holy Light Clan.<br>But, that case was no small matter. Opening it was no easy task either.<br>Furthermore, if one forced it open, it would be very dangerous.<br>For the sake of confirming how dangerous it was to open the case, they deliberately went out of their way to find the All-seeing Heavenly Master and have her conduct a prophecy for them.<br>The outcome of that prophecy was not optimistic either.<br>There was naturally a reason why Xianhai Shaoyu was so interested in that case.<br>There exists a legend regarding that case in their own galaxy. According to the legend, that case was something created by a peak expert of the Ancient Era through the gathering of natural energies and countless treasures.<br>The person who was able to open the case would most definitely be someone who could reach the apex of the martial cultivation world.<br>It was unknown as to exactly what sort of treasure was inside that case.<br>Xianhai Shaoyu was not concerned as to whether or not there were treasures inside that case.<br>He wanted to utilize the case to determine if he was the person who would be able to stand at the apex of the martial cultivation world.<br>&ldquo;Senior Gusu, you don&rsquo;t have to attempt to stop me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I came to the Holy Light Galaxy all for this case.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I really wanted to know if I, Xianhai Shaoyu, will be able to reach that place with my talent,&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Young master, you are not someone who believes in fate.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t believe in such superstition,&rdquo; said Lady Gusu.<br>&ldquo;This is no superstition. It is an actual test.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Withstanding this test relies on one&rsquo;s true abilities,&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Young master&rsquo;s talent has been acknowledged by the entire clan. There really isn&rsquo;t a need to take such a risk.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Lord young master, what Lady Gusu said is extremely correct. With your talent, there&rsquo;s simply no need for a test.&rdquo;<br>Lady Gusu was still trying to dissuade Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>Even Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er spoke to dissuade him.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to bother trying to dissuade me anymore. Neither of you will be able to stop me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Rather than trying to dissuade me, why not help me with a task,&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Young master, what is the task?&rdquo; asked Lady Gusu.<br>Xianhai Shaoyu did not answer directly. Instead, he took out a talisman paper from his chest and handed it to Lady Gusu.<br>&ldquo;Lord young master, what is the meaning of this?&rdquo;<br>Seeing that talisman paper, Lady Gusu began to panic.<br>That was a Life Talisman Paper. It could detect Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s life aura.<br>Xianhai Shaoyu handing her his own Life Talisman Paper was not a good omen at all.<br>&ldquo;Senior, Xin&rsquo;er, do you know why I&rsquo;m opening this case here?&rdquo; asked Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>Both Lady Gusu and Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er shook their heads.<br>They do not understand why Xianhai Shaoyu chose this place to open the case.<br>&ldquo;If I am truly unable to withstand the power within this case, there&rsquo;s someone here who could rescue me,&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Lord young master, how could you place your trust in those two world spiritists?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re only Saint-cloak World Spiritists that had grasped Dragon Transformation Sensation. They&rsquo;re simply unable to do anything about that case,&rdquo; said Lady Gusu.<br>The first people she thought of were Ox-nosed Old Daoist and Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>But, Xianhai Shaoyu shook his head.<br>He said, &ldquo;The person capable of saving me is not them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Instead, it&rsquo;s Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br></p></div>
