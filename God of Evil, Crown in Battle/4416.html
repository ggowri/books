        <div>: Don&rsquo;t Be a Sore Loser<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sudden interjection from the Ox-nosed Old Daoist made everyone realize that something was going to happen, but they couldn&rsquo;t tell exactly what the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was driving at. So, they could only continue observing the situation.<br>&ldquo;What is unfair about it?&rdquo; Li Muzhi asked the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;While my disciple, Chu Feng, was setting up his formation, you have been secretly reinforcing the formation you constructed. Over an incense&rsquo;s time, your formation has grown much stronger than before whereas my disciple has barely completed constructing his formation. Given that you used an incense&rsquo;s time more than my disciple, can we really call it a fair battle?&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s actually such a matter?&rdquo;<br>Long Xiaoxiao and the others were shocked to hear those words.<br>Even the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was stunned too.<br>They were too preoccupied with observing Chu Feng that they hadn&rsquo;t noticed what Li Muzhi was doing in the dark, so they weren&rsquo;t too certain whether the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was framing Li Muzhi, or that Li Muzhi really cheated in the dark.<br>&ldquo;I did reinforce the formation, but what&rsquo;s unfair about that? From the start, I&rsquo;ve never said that we aren&rsquo;t allowed to reinforce the formation. Don&rsquo;t forget, I&rsquo;m the one who set the rules, so I&rsquo;m more aware of them than you are.&rdquo;<br>Yet, to everyone&rsquo;s surprise, not only did Li Muzhi not try to refute the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s accusation, he even admitted to it readily. Instead of thinking of it as a shame, he thought that it was only natural to do so.<br>His attitude really provoked the ire of those present, but no one dared to say anything to him.<br>&ldquo;If you think that it&rsquo;s unfair, we can end the duel right here. In the first place, I wasn&rsquo;t the one who requested for this duel, so I&rsquo;m fine with anything.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Li Muzhi turned to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;How is it? Do you wish to continue with the duel? If so, I won&rsquo;t be holding back at all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s continue,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Boom!<br>Right after saying those words, countless silver swords began hurtling toward Chu Feng furiously like a hailstorm.<br>Each of these silver swords carried tremendous prowess, and the number of them was uncountable. It was no exaggeration to describe it as a devastating force.<br>This was the might of the formation Li Muzhi had constructed.<br>Even though he had only learned it from Chu Feng a moment ago, he was able to bring out the prowess of the formation to nearly its full potential.<br>&ldquo;Activate formation!&rdquo; Chu Feng bellowed.<br>He raised his hand and pointed his finger ahead of him.<br>Swoosh swoosh swoosh!<br>Countless golden swords darted forth from Chu Feng&rsquo;s formation, and in terms of momentum, it actually paled nowhere in comparison to Li Muzhi&rsquo;s.<br>This was the formation which Chu Feng had learned from Li Muzhi.<br>While the two formations had their differences, their attacking pattern was strikingly similar to one another.<br>Li Muzhi had done it on purpose. He had learned Chu Feng&rsquo;s formation in advance, so he knew what kind of formation Chu Feng had brought out.<br>So, he intentionally took out a similar slaughtering formation and had Chu Feng set it up so as to showcase his superiority with all things equal.<br>The golden and silver glints clashed against one another in the sky, causing deafening clangs to echo loudly in the surroundings.<br>The battle appeared to fall into a stalemate for a moment, but soon enough, Chu Feng&rsquo;s formation began to be suppressed.<br>Li Muzhi&rsquo;s formation was actually slightly stronger, both in terms of might and number of swords.<br>&ldquo;Like I told you, even though the formation constructed plays a huge role, what&rsquo;s more important is the ability of the world spiritist to control the formation! I shall use your own formation to defeat you today!&rdquo;<br>As Li Muzhi said those words, the might of his formation actually grew even stronger.<br>Yet another massive barrage of silver swords rained out from his formation and whizzed in Chu Feng&rsquo;s direction.<br>Chu Feng tried his best to fend against the barrage of swords, but he still found himself slowly getting more and more suppressed.<br>The silver sword rain was swiftly getting closer and closer to Chu Feng, but the golden sword rain still remained limited in terms of number.<br>Long Xiaoxiao, Yu Ting, and the others were so nervous that their bodies were trembling fearfully.<br>They knew that the prowess of the slaughtering formation was not enough to kill Chu Feng, but once Chu Feng lost the duel, his life would be forfeit.<br>&ldquo;Is this all you have?&rdquo; Chu Feng suddenly taunted fearlessly.<br>His words were directed toward Li Muzhi.<br>&ldquo;What are you saying?&rdquo;<br>Li Muzhi was finding it hard to believe his own words. He didn&rsquo;t think that Chu Feng would dare to taunt him even while he was already on the verge of defeat.<br>&ldquo;I said, you used an additional incense&rsquo;s time to reinforce your formation, but is this all you are able to do?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;You are really seeking death!&rdquo;<br>Those words really incurred Li Muzhi&rsquo;s rage, and a wintry glint flickered across his eyes.<br>With a furious howl, he released his full spirit power to drive the slaughtering formation to its limits, causing the number of silver swords raining out from the formation to further increase.<br>Facing such a situation, Chu Feng simply calmly remarked, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the end.&rdquo;<br>Weng!<br>Right after saying those words, Chu Feng&rsquo;s slaughtering formation began to change.<br>It was already emanating a brilliant light before, but all of a sudden, its brilliance seemed to have become two times brighter.<br>On top of that, the number of golden swords whizzing out of Chu Feng&rsquo;s formation had also grown by twofold.<br>With this sudden surge in prowess, the tables were immediately turned around.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s golden sword rain began to suppress Li Muzhi&rsquo;s silver sword rain instead, and in the blink of an eye, his assault had already arrived before Li Muzhi.<br>&ldquo;This is&hellip; a formation within a formation?&rdquo;<br>The crowd widened their eyes in astonishment.<br>At this moment, they could already tell that there was another formation hidden within Chu Feng&rsquo;s formation. From the very start, he had been constructing not one but two formations.<br>It was due to the second formation that Chu Feng was able to suddenly increase the number of golden swords by twofold.<br>&ldquo;How could this be? Chu Feng was actually able to set up two formations within an incense&rsquo;s time? How did he manage to do it?&rdquo;<br>This sight had really left everyone stunned. Putting aside outsiders, even the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had his mouth widened in shock too.<br>The golden sword rain had not only completely curbed Li Muzhi&rsquo;s silver sword rain, it had even surrounded Li Muzhi, encircling him tightly.<br>Of course, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t go any further than that out of fear of hurting Li Muzhi, but everyone knew that the victor of this duel was Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Mere trickery! All you know is to weave in little tricks in your formation to befuddle others!&rdquo;<br>He had already given up on the duel, knowing that it was impossible for him to win anymore. However, the eyes that he looked at Chu Feng with were filled with fury.<br>Clearly, he was infuriated by this defeat.<br>&ldquo;Li Muzhi, don&rsquo;t be a sore loser.&rdquo;<br>But at this very moment, a voice sounded from the sky. It was from Li Muzhi&rsquo;s grandfather.<br></p></div>
