        <div><span>: A Chance to Compete</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>&ldquo;Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t expect the other party to be from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. He wondered if the Life Crystals were under their control.</span><br><span>Klang!</span><br><span>Before Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing could say a word, two formation swords were pointed at their faces.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Who told you to come here?&rdquo; the white-haired woman asked with a voice dripping with killing intent.</span><br><span>Both middle-aged women were highly guarded against Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing; they wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to take their lives should the two answer wrongly. Not daring to get careless, Chu Feng took out the broken sword he had received from Old Man Zhou.</span><br><span>The two middle-aged women were surprised to see the broken sword. They grabbed the broken sword and carefully examined it. After verifying that it was authentic, they turned to Chu Feng and asked, &ldquo;Where did you get this from?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Old Man Zhou sent us here. I received this sword from him,&rdquo; Chu Feng honestly replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Old Man Zhou? Could it be&hellip;&rdquo;</span><br><span>The two women glanced at each other to verify their conjectures.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Why did he send you here?&rdquo; the white-haired woman asked. She had retracted her killing intent, and her voice had gotten much gentler too.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I need Life Crystals,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Life Crystals? Why did Lord Deranged Exalted tell him that too?&rdquo; the black-haired woman exclaimed. She carefully assessed Chu Feng, hoping to uncover more clues from him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name? What relationship do you have with the Old Man Zhou you speak of?&rdquo; the white-haired woman asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I am Chu Feng. I met Old Man Zhou once by coincidence,&rdquo; Chu Feng answered.</span><br><span>&ldquo;He told you about the Life Crystals when you have only met him once?&rdquo; the black-haired woman asked. In contrast to the white-haired woman, she was much more guarded toward Chu Feng, and she didn&rsquo;t hesitate to express her hostility.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Why do you need Life Crystals?&rdquo; the white-haired woman asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I need them to treat my friend,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Your friend is a world spirit?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;I can see that your world spirit means a lot to you, but I ought to remind you that the Life Crystals are only effective after they have been awakened&hellip; and it&rsquo;s nigh impossible to awaken a Life Crystal,&rdquo; the white-haired woman said.</span><br><span>Bai Yunqing interjected before Chu Feng could answer, &ldquo;Elder, we are aware of that. My big brother has already awakened a Life Crystal.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;You awakened a Life Crystal?&rdquo; The two women were taken aback.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, I did.&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.</span><br><span>The black-haired woman snorted upon hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s confirmation. Clearly, she didn&rsquo;t believe him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Was the Life Crystal not enough to treat your friend&rsquo;s injuries?&rdquo; the white-haired woman asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;My friend is in terrible condition. She&rsquo;ll need a lot more Life Crystals,&rdquo; Chu Feng answered.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are you sure that Old Man Zhou gave this to you? Did he mention anything else?&rdquo; the white-haired woman gestured to the broken sword as she asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;He told me that you&rsquo;d give the Life Crystals to me as long as I brought this item here,&rdquo; Chu Feng lied.</span><br><span>As much as he wasn&rsquo;t fond of lying, he could tell that the other party was reluctant to give Life Crystals to him. It was understandable since Life Crystals were a precious resource. However, he had to obtain the Life Crystals even if it meant resorting to thievery, and he was willing to do anything for Eggy&rsquo;s sake.</span><br><span>Thus, he hoped to use Old Man Zhou&rsquo;s name to force them into giving him the Life Crystals. As expected, the white-haired woman&rsquo;s face turned grim.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are you in urgent need of the Life Crystals?&rdquo; the white-haired woman asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, I am in urgent need of them,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It might be a little risky. Are you still willing to go through with it?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, I am willing.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Wait here for a moment.&rdquo;</span><br><span>The white-haired woman shot a glance at the black-haired woman, and the two of them vanished on the spot. They had headed off for a moment to hold a private conversation.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big sister, you can&rsquo;t be serious. Are you going to allow a stranger to attend our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s trial? That&rsquo;s against the rules!&rdquo; the black-haired woman said reluctantly.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Little sister, let me ask you one question. What should we do if Lord Nianqing leaves the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?&rsquo; the white-haired woman asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll leave the Seven Realm Sacred Mansion together with her. Lord Nianqing is our benefactor, and we have already pledged our lives to her,&rdquo; the black-haired woman said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What are you hesitating for then? The only reason we are affiliated with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion is because Lord Nianqing is with them too. The one whom we </span><span>have sworn fealty to is Lord Nianqing, not the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. That broken sword was a gift that Lord Nianqing gave to Lord Deranged Exalted. Lord Nianqing clearly instructed us to fulfill the request of anyone who approaches us with this broken sword,&rdquo; the white-haired woman said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big sis, it&rsquo;s one thing if he&rsquo;s the descendant of Lord Deranged Exalted, but that isn&rsquo;t so. You should know how important Life Crystals are. They are invaluable treasures to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion! How can we give them to an outsider?&rdquo; the black-haired woman said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Deranged Exalted must have his own reason for entrusting the broken sword to this child. It isn&rsquo;t our place to wonder about his relationship with Lord Deranged Exalted,&rdquo; the white-haired woman said.</span><br><span>The black-haired woman fell silent.</span><br><span>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t help this child, Lord Nianqing will surely blame us once he returns and learns about this matter. You and I both know what kind of suffering Lord Nianqing is currently going through. It&rsquo;s practically torture instead of cultivation. She always returns in a terrible mood. You should know the consequences of provoking her at a time like this,&rdquo; the white-haired woman said.</span><br><span>The black-haired woman quivered upon hearing those words. &ldquo;All right, but we only have a single refined Life Crystal on hand, and that&rsquo;s the final reward for the trial that young master Jie Yu and the others are going through. We can&rsquo;t arbitrarily revoke the reward and hand it to someone else instead, right? Why don&rsquo;t we just keep them waiting here and wait for Lord Nianqing to return and make a decision?&rdquo; the black-haired woman proposed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know when Lord Nianqing is returning, and that man outside seems to be in a rush. The fact that a single Life Crystal isn&rsquo;t enough to save his world spirit shows just how terrible her condition is. Things might worsen if we drag things out,&rdquo; the white-haired woman said.</span><br><span>The black-haired woman laughed upon hearing those words.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big sister, you can&rsquo;t really be thinking that that brat can awaken the Life Crystal?&rdquo; the black-haired woman asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Honestly speaking, I think that it might be possible. Otherwise, Lord Deranged Exalted wouldn&rsquo;t have bothered sending him here in the first place,&rdquo; the white-haired woman replied.</span><br><span>The black-haired woman didn&rsquo;t say a word, but her expression reflected her skepticism.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s decided then. I&rsquo;ll deal with the Immortal Grass in the northern area while you take him to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s trial. Tell him who he&rsquo;ll be facing in the trial. If he fails the trial, tell him that he can wait till Lord Nianqing returns, though we don&rsquo;t know when she&rsquo;ll be returning. If he&rsquo;s willing to wait, let him. Otherwise, let him go,&rdquo; the white-haired woman said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, yes. I got it. You should hurry up and head off, big sister. I&rsquo;ll settle this issue,&rdquo; the </span><span>black-haired woman said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Mm.&rdquo; The white-haired woman nodded before soaring into the sky.</span><br><span>The black-haired woman returned to where Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing were and instructed them, &ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo;</span><br><span>She led the two of them through the mountain and a grass field, till a huge floating city appeared before their eyes.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Wait here for me.&rdquo;</span><br><span>She left Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing in the empty clearing before heading off. A moment later, an old woman came.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are the two of you here for the Life Crystal?&rdquo; the old woman asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, we are,&rdquo; Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing replied in unison.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to undergo the trial in order to acquire the Life Crystal, and the trial could prove to be dangerous. Are you certain you want to go through with this?&rdquo; the old woman asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Why do we have to go through a trial?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing muttered unhappily. He thought that they could directly obtain the Life Crystal by borrowing Old Man Zhou&rsquo;s halo.</span><br><span>On the other hand, Chu Feng nodded and replied, &ldquo;Yes, I am certain.&rdquo;</span><br><span>He had already realized that it wouldn&rsquo;t be easy to obtain the Life Crystals, but he had no intention of backing down here.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Since you have made up your mind, follow me.&rdquo;</span><br><span>The old woman brought Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing out of the city and into a forest. Everything inside the forest is an invaluable cultivation resource, be it trees, flowers, or grasses. While they weren&rsquo;t particularly potent, there were a huge number of them around.</span><br><span>Upon reaching the depth of the forest, Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing spotted a mountain with a humongous stone gate at its center. They were all juniors carrying identical tokens on their waists, revealing their identities as juniors of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.</span><br><span>Bai Yunqing trembled in excitement.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are they taking the trial too? We&rsquo;re going to be up against the juniors of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion!&rdquo;</span><br><span>He was excited at the opportunity to clash with the juniors of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.</span><br></p></div>
