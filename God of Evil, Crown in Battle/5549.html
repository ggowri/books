        <h1>Chapter 5549: An Opportunity Surfaces</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you still can&rsquo;t shake off your excessive kindness. You knew that old man was just a formation entity, but you still risked your life to help him. You do know that you&rsquo;d be sentenced to death if you were caught snooping in this area, right?&rdquo; Eggy grumbled.</span><br><span>She was not complaining about Chu Feng&rsquo;s kind act. Even though she would never step in to save a stranger, she wouldn&rsquo;t stop Chu Feng from doing so. She knew that they had different values, and she was willing to respect that.</span><br><span>What irked her was how Chu Feng put himself at risk to save that old man.</span><br><span>&ldquo;To be frank, I did hesitate for a moment there, but I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to turn a blind </span><span>eye to that old man, even if he was just a formation entity,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a sigh.</span><br><span>He also knew that it wasn&rsquo;t the wisest decision to help the old man, especially since he wasn&rsquo;t just putting himself at risk but Eggy too. Yet, he was unable to bring himself to turn a blind eye to someone in need.</span><br><span>He knew that there were countless people dying with each passing second, and there was no way he could save everyone. Thus, his goal of becoming stronger had never been to save the world but just to protect those whom he cared about.</span><br><span>Even so, he couldn&rsquo;t control himself whenever he encountered a person in need.</span><br><span>Of course, he would still weigh the pros and cons, but more often than not, he would step in and help the person even if it posed a danger to him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Eggy. I keep risking our lives to save strangers,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied apologetically.</span><br><span>This wasn&rsquo;t the first time something like this had happened, but he knew deep down that it wasn&rsquo;t going to be the last either. He simply couldn&rsquo;t change himself.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What are you saying? That&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m getting at. You should know it too. I&rsquo;m just&hellip; just&hellip; I&rsquo;m just worried about you! I&rsquo;m not blaming you. You should follow your heart. If you force yourself to go against your will, it might end up becoming an impediment to your cultivation in the future,&rdquo; Eggy consoled him.</span><br><span>Warmed by her words, Chu Feng&rsquo;s lips curled up. He knew better than anyone else how much Eggy cared for him.</span><br><span>&hellip;</span><br><span>As soon as Chu Feng returned to his residence, 399 rushed out to serve him tea.</span><br><span>Chu Feng immediately noticed that something was amiss and asked, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re injured?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo; 399 vehemently shook his head.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I can see it. Your concealment can&rsquo;t fool me,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Milord, I don&rsquo;t mean to hide it from you.&rdquo;</span><br><span>399 hurriedly kneeled on the floor to apologize for his deception, but Chu Feng stretched his hand forth to support him up.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not blaming you, but you have to tell me who&rsquo;s the culprit.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng could tell that someone had beaten 399 up, but the latter didn&rsquo;t answer his question as if he was afraid of something.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take your refusal to answer as a lack of trust in me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Milord, I have no such intention! We have only known each other for a short period of time, but milord has treated me extremely well. This is the first time in my life anyone has treated me so well!&rdquo; 399 exclaimed.</span><br><span>Chu Feng could tell that 399&rsquo;s hesitation stemmed from his worry for Chu Feng. He was afraid that he would bring trouble to Chu Feng, which was why he tried to conceal his injuries in the first place.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Tell me who wounded you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s 788!&rdquo; 399 said.</span><br><span>Chu Feng had an impression of 788&mdash;he was the man with white brows&rsquo; lackey.</span><br><span>&ldquo;They have made up their mind to make a move on me?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Hostility flashed across Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes. He knew that this was no coincidence&mdash;it must have been the man with white brows&rsquo; orders. Bullying his follower was just the appetizer; soon, they would go after him too.</span><br><span>Chu Feng patted 399&rsquo;s shoulder and said, &ldquo;You have suffered, but bear with it a little longer.&rdquo;</span><br><span>He would exact vengeance on the man with white brows for 399&rsquo;s sake even if the latter didn&rsquo;t go after him, but he didn&rsquo;t think it was time yet. Both he and 399 had to swallow this grievance for the time being.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Rest assured, milord. I won&rsquo;t hold it against them,&rdquo; 399 heaved a sigh of relief as he said.</span><br><span>He was relieved to hear that Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t going to make a move since he didn&rsquo;t want to cause trouble for the latter. In the first place, he had never thought about exacting vengeance.</span><br><span>However, 399&rsquo;s response only affirmed Chu Feng&rsquo;s determination to exact vengeance for him.</span><br><span>The following day, Chu Feng made his way to the Formation Master Hall, but he removed 399&rsquo;s concealment formation, leaving the latter&rsquo;s injuries in plain view.</span><br><span>No one from the Formation Master Hall was surprised to see 399&rsquo;s injuries. Some even sneered in disdain. Not a single person showed concern for 399 or Chu Feng. All of them knew what had happened.</span><br><span>Chu Feng headed to the pill forging formation and tried to further decipher the sea of energy, but it was to no avail.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It looks like it&rsquo;ll be difficult for me to overcome this bottleneck.&rdquo;</span><br><span>To be exact, it was not that he couldn&rsquo;t overcome this bottleneck but that it would take him a long time to do so. The problem was that he didn&rsquo;t think that he had the time for that, so he decided to find other ways to raise his spirit power.</span><br><span>In truth, there were plenty of opportunities to raise one&rsquo;s spirit power in the city, just that such opportunities weren&rsquo;t easy to obtain. That being said, he figured that he could try siphoning energy from the formations that granted spirit power instead.</span><br><span>As long as he could reach Grey Dragon God-cloak, he would be able to breach the barrier to find Little Fishy. With Little Fishy vouching for his identity, he would be able to solve many of his existing problems.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Dang, dang, dang&hellip;&rdquo; a bell suddenly chimed.</span><br><span>The chiming piqued the excitement of all of the formation masters, as they put down their work and rushed out of the Formation Master Hall. Not a person tried to stop them even though they were ditching work.</span><br><span>From the conversations around him, Chu Feng quickly figured out what had happened.</span><br><span>It turned out that the chimes were from the town&rsquo;s assembly bell, which was only sounded when something huge was going to happen. It was usually a special mission that had no requirements on one&rsquo;s standing, meaning that everyone could participate in it.</span><br><span>Anyone who cleared the mission would be granted the opportunity to raise their spirit </span><span>power.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think that an opportunity would come by that quickly.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng also left his workstation to head in the direction of the assembly bell.</span><br><span>A huge plaque placed in front of the assembly bell revealed the purpose behind this gathering. Upon reading the plaque&rsquo;s content, the already excited Chu Feng grew even more excited.</span><br></p></div>
