        <h1>Chapter 419</h1>
        <div> - Illusion Method<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>&ldquo;Hmph. You want to stop me from changing the formation? He is useless. I, as a Blue-cloak World Spiritist, in terms of defense methods, am far above you. Don&rsquo;t even think of touching me.&rdquo; The Hundred-faced Old Man coldly snorted. A layer of blue-coloured Spirit Formation surrounded him and protected him inside.<br>&ldquo;The final two Attacking Talismans. Victory or defeat will be decided by this.&rdquo;<br>However, Chu Feng did not move slowly. His palm lightly brushed past his Cosmos Sack and the remaining two Attacking Talismans appeared in his palm. He first threw one at the Spirit Formation, and with a boom, the Spirit Formation the Hundred-faced Old Man laid was shattered by Chu Feng&rsquo;s Attacking Talisman.<br>&ldquo;Hmph. I would quite like to see how many more of these overbearing Attacking Talismans you have.&rdquo; The Hundred-faced Old Man coldly snorted, and wanted to recondense a Spirit Formation to defend against Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you won&rsquo;t have this chance.&rdquo; But just at that time, radiance greatly bloomed and the faint green-coloured armor had actually gave off a large area of white-coloured fog, instantly engulfing the Hundred-faced Old Man.<br>&ldquo;This is?!&rdquo; At that instant, even the Hundred-faced Old Man&rsquo;s expression couldn&rsquo;t help but change greatly and at the same time, he retreated a few steps.<br>Because, he astonishedly discovered that in front of him, in Chu Feng&rsquo;s previous position, an extremely terrifying huge beast appeared.<br>That huge beast was faint green-coloured, and it seemed like an invulnerable huge tortoise. But on the body of the tortoise, an extremely horrifying huge snake coiled around it. The snake and tortoise seemed to be one, and they emanated extremely terrifying aura.<br>&ldquo;What is happening? How did Chu Feng suddenly become such a terrifying monster? Is it possible that the reason he defied common sense is because he was never a human in the first place? Can it be that he&rsquo;s a horrifying monster?&rdquo;<br>Just in that split moment, the Hundred-faced Old Man was scared, because within the monster in front of him, he felt an extremely terrifying aura. It was an aura that suppressed his. An aura that he could not fight against.<br>&ldquo;Wait, this is an illusion.&rdquo; But suddenly, the eyes of the Hundred-faced Old Man flashed and his expression changed. He, as a Blue-cloak World Spiritist, felt that the monster in front of his eyes wasn&rsquo;t real, and seemed more like an illusion.<br>Thinking to that point, he hurriedly condensed Spirit power to break the illusion in front of him. As expected, just as his Spirit power became condensed, the monster in front of his eyes started to fade away.<br>&ldquo;Crap.&rdquo;<br>However, as he broke the illusion, he did not celebrate because of that. Instead, unprecedented fear surged on his face because at that very instant, an extremely horrifying Attacking Talisman, at that moment, had already landed on his chest.<br>*boom*<br>A rumble exploded in front of the Hundred-faced Old Man&rsquo;s chest, and instantly, he miserably cried out, was thrown dozens of meters away, fiercely collided into the Spirit Formation that he laid himself, then powerlessly fell limply onto the ground.<br>At that instant, although the Hundred-faced Old Man&rsquo;s four limbs were still complete, there was a huge hole in his chest. His dantian was already damaged, his organs were ruined, and he was vomiting mouthfuls of black blood and his body was endlessly twitching when fallen on the ground.<br>&ldquo;I never would have thought that even this Attacking Talisman couldn&rsquo;t directly take his life away. No wonder even my Asura Ghost Axe was unable to harm him. So this is the power of a Heaven realm body?&rdquo; Looking at the Hundred-faced Old Man who fell onto the ground, constantly twitched, and had already lost power to fight, Chu Feng muttered to himself and his face was filled with an emotional expression.<br>Although he knew the reason why the Hundred-faced Old Man&rsquo;s physical body was so strong was indeed partly due to the manmade Elite Armament, his original body was extremely strong as well. Or else, he wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to use the power of the manmade Elite Armament.<br>This time, even though Chu Feng won against the Hundred-faced Old Man, it was a risky victory and he also relied on an unexpected surprise attack. It could be said that the reason why Chu Feng won against the Hundred-faced Old Man was because he didn&rsquo;t rely on his own body&rsquo;s strength, but his own wits and that single strand of luck.<br>In the past few days, although he was killing the disciples of the six big powers everywhere, he was simultaneously honing his own battle techniques. The reason why the Dragon Travelling Through Nine Heavens was able to be freely used by him in battle was the result of the past few days.<br>Other than that, Chu Feng even comprehended the Illusion Method of the Black Tortoise Armor Technique. Just now, he used the Illusion Method to bring the Hundred-faced Old Man into a dulled state so he could not continue condensing Spirit Formations and it gave Chu Feng a chance to heavily injure him with the Attacking Talisman.<br>To be more precise, what Chu Feng relied on in his surprise attack was the Illusion Method of the Black Tortoise Armor Technique as well as the Attacking Talisman Vice-head Gao gave him. That was Chu Feng&rsquo;s final trump card. If he failed, he would die; but he succeeded.<br>Because, no matter if the Hundred-faced Old Man had even more abundant battle experience, was even more cunning as a person, he never would have expected Chu Feng to be able to grasp Illusion Methods. He even didn&rsquo;t need to lay Spirit Formations and he could use it with only a thought. Exactly because of that carelessness, he took a great hit.<br>At that instant, Chu Feng truly couldn&rsquo;t help but want to sigh in admiration towards the master of the Emperor Tomb because he created such a strong Secret Skill. Otherwise, truly, Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t have had that much luck.<br>*hmm*<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, this isn&rsquo;t good. He wants to condense a consciousness!&rdquo; Suddenly, Eggy nervously reminded.<br>Only at that instant did Chu Feng discover that the Hundred-faced Old Man was indeed condensing his consciousness. Although his dantian was already damaged and his cultivation cultivated in many years was flowing away, his consciousness was still equipped with a portion of his cultivation. If his condensation was successful, it would not be a small trouble to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but it&rsquo;s better if you die away peacefully.&rdquo; Chu Feng waved the Asura Ghost Axe in his hand and chopped towards the neck of the Hundred-faced Old Man and cut off his everything.<br>&ldquo;Noo~~~~&rdquo; In response, the Hundred-faced Old Man who was already heavily injured yelled extremely bitterly and loudly.<br>However, Chu Feng had no mercy. With a poof, the head of the Hundred-faced Old Man fell onto the ground, and at the same time, the consciousness he was condensing was also shattered by the power of the Asura Ghost Axe. The Hundred-faced Old man thoroughly became a dead person and there was not a trace of aura remaining.<br>&ldquo;Haha, Chu Feng you boy, not bad! What you&rsquo;ve done today was beautiful! You won an unwinnable battle, and I truly look at you in another light.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Quick, absorb this old guy&rsquo;s Source energy. The fresh Source energy of the 3rd level of the Heaven realm should be able to help me break into the 5th level of the Profound realm, and there&rsquo;s even a possibility that I break into the 6th level of the Profound realm.&rdquo; Eggy happily shouted.<br>Chu Feng also didn&rsquo;t move slow and he hurriedly helped Eggy to absorb the Hundred-faced Old Man&rsquo;s Source energy. Just as Eggy thought, her cultivation indeed rose from the 4th level of the Profound realm to the 5th level of the Profound realm. Although she was unable to reach the 6th level of the Profound realm, there wasn&rsquo;t much to it.<br>Afterwards, Chu Feng checked the Hundred-faced Old Man&rsquo;s Cosmos Sack. The seemingly insignificant check caused Chu Feng to be instantly endlessly elated because the Hundred-faced Old Man&rsquo;s Cosmos Sack was truly a huge treasure trove.<br></p></div>
