        <h1>Chapter 5679: The Jie Clan Heaven Crushing Army’s Jie Feng</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Is it tough to cultivate in the ancestral forbidden land?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know either, but judging from the lightning&rsquo;s prowess, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine that it would be easy,&rdquo; Ling Yunhao replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng could guess as much, but he asked that question to verify it. This made him a little worried about his mother. But again, if so many people in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion knew that his mother was cultivating in the ancestral forbidden land, there was a chance that this might just be a decoy, and that his mother might have been somewhere else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless, he hoped that his mother was being treated kindly, or else he wouldn&rsquo;t let the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master off, even if the latter was his grandfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group&rsquo;s footsteps didn&rsquo;t slow despite their conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Along the way, they saw a tower, a palace, a stone forest, a lake, and many other landmarks. These were all cultivation grounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their destination was none other than the stone forest. The stones inside the stone forest came in all shapes and sizes, but every single one of them harnessed spirit power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group eventually stopped before a massive boulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This boulder was cylindrical in shape. It had a radius of a thousand meters, with a height of around a hundred meters. It looked like a chess piece on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside the boulder was a stone monument, with the words &lsquo;Psyche Forging Boulder&rsquo;.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Little brother Chu Feng, what you see before you </span><span>is</span><span> our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Seven Realms Boulder. All of the stones in this stone forest are beneficial for our cultivation, but the Seven Realms Boulder boasts the greatest effect. You might require some time to adapt to it since it&rsquo;s your first time here, but don&rsquo;t worry. You should be able to adapt to it within a few hours given your talent,&rdquo; Ling </span><span>Xinian</span><span> said as she leaped onto the Psyche Forging Boulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment she landed on the Psyche Forging Boulder, an invisible surge of energy gushed from the boulder to envelop her. She showed a slight frown for a brief instant, but she quickly recovered and flashed a beaming smile at Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ling Yunhao and the others did the same too, and they were also enveloped by the invisible energy the moment they landed on the boulder. Some of them frowned, whereas the others gritted their teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Brother Chu Feng. Come up,&rdquo; Ling Yunhao said with a cheeky grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied as he leaped onto the Psyche Forging Boulder too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group stared at Chu Feng expectantly, hoping to see how he would react. Yet, there was not the slightest expression on his face at all. The energy gushing into his body did inflict pain on him, but it was nothing of concern to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ling </span><span>Xinian</span><span> and the others were taken aback. Some of them even examined Chu Feng as they suspected that he had used a treasure to protect himself, only to be forced to conclude that he was indeed bearing the energy of the Psyche Forging Boulder like the rest of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng&hellip; is it not painful?&rdquo; Ling Yunhao asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It is, but it&rsquo;s bearable,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Bearable?&rdquo; Ling Yunhao and the others looked at one another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They still remembered the excruciating pain they felt when they first stepped onto the Psyche Forging Boulder. None of them could remain unfazed, and some even leaped off it right away. Of course, they had adapted to it after years of cultivating on the boulder, but the pain they felt at the instant they stepped onto the rock would still distort their expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn&rsquo;t believe how Chu Feng had immediately adapted to the boulder even though it was his first time here. There were no more than ten people in the history of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion who had achieved that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;My little brother Chu Feng is extraordinary. It&rsquo;s no wonder you were first place in the entrance examination,&rdquo; Ling </span><span>Xinian</span><span> generously complimented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just more thick-skinned. That&rsquo;s nothing special,&rdquo; a voice suddenly echoed from afar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two men dressed in the same armor as Ling </span><span>Xinian</span><span> and the others appeared in the distance, but the cloak they wore was embroidered not with the word &lsquo;Ling&rsquo; but &lsquo;Jie&rsquo;. The two of them landed on a stone neighboring the Psyche Forging Boulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Why are you here? Today is our Ling Clan Heaven Crushing Army&rsquo;s cultivation day,&rdquo; Ling Yunhao asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Are we not allowed to enter the Sacred Mansion just because it&rsquo;s not our cultivation day?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A white-haired man flitted in. He had a youthful complexion, and his white hair was </span><span>tied into a neat ponytail, making him look suave. He seemed to be nearing three hundred years old, similar to Ling </span><span>Xinian</span><span>, but it was difficult to discern his cultivation level due to his concealed aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judging from his speed, he was unlikely to be any weaker than Ling </span><span>Xinian</span><span>. He was at least at Immortal Dragon God-cloak, perhaps even surpassing that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Commander Jie Feng, t-that&rsquo;s not what I mean. Of course, you are able to enter the Sacred Mansion as and when you like,&rdquo; Ling Yunhao replied meekly. He even lowered his head, not daring to meet the other party&rsquo;s eyes, showing how frightened he was of the white-haired man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Remember, it&rsquo;s not just me. Our Jie Clan Heaven Crushing Army is free to access the Sacred Mansion as they please,&rdquo; Jie Feng said before turning to Chu Feng. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re that Chu Feng?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, Jie Feng is the commander of the Jie Clan Heaven Crushing Army, and his grandfather is one of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s grand elders. You must be courteous to him. We can&rsquo;t offend him,&rdquo; Ling Yunhao anxiously sent a voice transmission to Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I am Chu Feng, but I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m the one you&rsquo;re looking for,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a courteous smile, but his attitude was neither rude nor deferential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;The champion of the entrance examination. If not for that title, they wouldn&rsquo;t have bothered befriending you and bringing you here to cultivate,&rdquo; Jie Feng said as he glanced at Ling </span><span>Xinian</span><span> and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Jie Feng, I am the vice commander of the Ling Clan Heaven Crushing Army. I have the right to bring Chu Feng here,&rdquo; Ling </span><span>Xinian</span><span> quickly replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Calm down, Ling </span><span>Xinian</span><span>. I didn&rsquo;t say that Chu Feng can&rsquo;t cultivate here. I&rsquo;m just curious to see what the champion of the entrance examination is capable of,&rdquo; Jie Feng said before turning to Chu Feng. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s boring here? Let me bring you to something more challenging.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Where do you intend to take him?&rdquo; Ling </span><span>Xinian</span><span> asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ling Yunhao and the others dared not to talk anymore. Ling </span><span>Xinian</span><span> was the only one who dared to confront Jie Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What about the Psyche Gravity Tower?&rdquo; Jie Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Psyche Gravity Tower?&rdquo; Ling </span><span>Xinian</span><span> and the others were stunned.</span></p></div>
