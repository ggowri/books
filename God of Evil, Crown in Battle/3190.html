        <h1>Chapter 3189</h1>
        <div> - Her True Identity<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The black whirlwind flew past in the sky.<br>Its speed was so fast that even if it wasn&rsquo;t concealed, it would be very difficult for others to notice it.<br>Its strength was not at all weaker than Bai Liluo&rsquo;s. It surpassed everyone in the Eastern Region.<br>Inside the black whirlwind, Chu Feng only felt completely dizzy, with his surroundings changing nonstop. Even his perception ability became extremely weak.<br>After a long time passed, Chu Feng finally regained his freedom from the whirlwind.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s feet landed on the ground. He discovered that he was standing in a desolate desert that stretched out as far as the eye could see.<br>Hot. This place was extremely hot.<br>If the Iceseal Forbidden Area was so cold that even martial cultivators felt it to be unbearable, then this place was so hot that even martial cultivators would feel it to be unbearable.<br>Being here, Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t help but gasp with admiration at how this Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm was filled with wondrous places.<br>It was no wonder that this place was called the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. This place would truly temper the martial cultivators inside.<br>That said, there was no time for Chu Feng to admire these things.<br>After all, he had been forcibly brought here.<br>Furthermore, he did not even know who it was that had abducted him and brought him here.<br>&ldquo;Why did you bring me here?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say that you couldn&rsquo;t trust my words? I will now have you personally witness Bai Liluo&rsquo;s true identity,&rdquo; that black silhouette said.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart moved. The black silhouette spoke in a very confident manner. It was as if he had proof to show how dangerous Bai Liluo was.<br>&ldquo;Wait for me,&rdquo; the black silhouette spoke again.<br>After he said those words, even though Chu Feng was unable to see the black silhouette, his intuition told him that he had left.<br>&ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; not long afterward, that black silhouette&rsquo;s voice sounded again. This time around, Chu Feng was able to see a black silhouette before him.<br>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s him?&rsquo; Chu Feng frowned as he looked to the shadow-like existence before him. Chu Feng felt that he was not seeing a person, but a demon.<br>Even though Chu Feng felt this black silhouette to be extremely untrustworthy, Chu Feng still followed him. The reason for that was because Chu Feng wanted to know exactly what sort of trick this black silhouette would play.<br>Besides, Chu Feng had no choice but to follow him. After all, he was forcibly brought here by that black silhouette.<br>After walking for a short while, water-like ripples suddenly appeared before the black silhouette. Chu Feng knew that it was a spirit formation. After the black silhouette passed through the ripples, he disappeared.<br>Following him, Chu Feng also passed through the ripples. Upon doing so, Chu Feng discovered that he had entered a mountain village.<br>This mountain village was very large. The buildings and houses here were not gorgeous. However, they were very exquisite. Rather than calling it a mountain village, it would be more suitable to call this place a city.<br>However, this place was very desolate. There were only nineteen people scattered through the entire village.<br>No, to be exact, they were not people, not human. Although they had the same appearance as humans, Chu Feng was able to sense their auras. The auras that they emitted were not those of humans.<br>The people inside the mountain village were not humans, nor were they monstrous beasts. If one must describe them, the auras on their bodies more resembled those of natural oddities.<br>Chu Feng was actually also uncertain as to whether these nineteen human-looking individuals were natural oddities or not.<br>However, Chu Feng felt that they had lost their minds. Although they were very well-dressed, they were moving about in this village like a bunch of walking corpses.<br>&ldquo;What sort of place is this? Who are they?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked that black silhouette.<br>&ldquo;They could be said to be the children of this Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm,&rdquo; that black silhouette replied.<br>&ldquo;Children?&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed.<br>&ldquo;The Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm is a place composed of countless spirit formations. Some of the spirit formations need to draw support from external objects. As for those external objects, they would be natural treasures, natural oddities.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Some natural oddities possess intelligence and can take human form. Due to the fact that they are closely bound to the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm&rsquo;s spirit formations, they gained a special status in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Inside this Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, they are practically undying and indestructible. They will be able to exist forever in this place.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for these natural oddities, although they have taken human form, they are not very strong and also possess timid natures. As such, they have decided to hide in this place, and not contact outsiders.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This place can be said to be their paradise.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for Bai Liluo, she is also one of them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No, to be exact, she is a monster. That&rsquo;s because the reason why these natural oddities ended up like this is all because of Bai Liluo,&rdquo; that black silhouette said.<br>&ldquo;Why did you say that she&rsquo;s a monster? Is it because she&rsquo;s different from these natural oddities and possesses enormous power?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;If that were all there were to it, she could not be considered dangerous, and would not be considered a monster. Follow me.&rdquo;<br>The black silhouette began to guide Chu Feng again. Chu Feng also followed him. They walked for a short while before they arrived at a tomb.<br>This was the only tomb in the entire village.<br>Seeing the tomb, Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes began to flicker. The reason for that was because the tombstone was carved with the name &lsquo;Bai Liluo.&rsquo;<br>Chu Feng was able to see through the tomb. Lying inside the coffin was a woman.<br>She appeared to be in her twenties, and had a very delicate and pretty look akin to that of celestial farities. Even though she had been dead for many years, there was no trace of paleness to her face. Instead, she appeared to just be sleeping.<br>&ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;She is the real Bai Liluo,&rdquo; the black silhouette answered.<br>&ldquo;She is Bai Liluo? In that case, who is the Bai Liluo that I know?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;The Bai Liluo that you know is currently training deep underground,&rdquo; the black silhouette pointed below.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re saying she&rsquo;s here right now?&rdquo; Hearing those words, Chu Feng hurriedly looked below with his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s useless. With your strength, you will not be able to penetrate the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm&rsquo;s strongest spirit formation. You will not be able to see anything,&rdquo; the black silhouette said.<br>Sure enough, it was as the black silhouette had said, even though Chu Feng was using his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, he was only able to see a vast amount of soil and nothing else.<br>&ldquo;Exactly what happened? Can you tell me of it?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be anxious. After all, I have brought you here in order to tell you the truth, and reveal her true identity,&rdquo; the black silhouette said.<br></p></div>
