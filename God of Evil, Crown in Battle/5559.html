        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>&ldquo;This is?&rdquo; Chu Feng feigned ignorance.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Take it. It&rsquo;ll alleviate your fatigue,&rdquo; Jie Tian replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; Chu Feng could tell that it was a poison pill, but he knew that he didn&rsquo;t have a choice here. He accepted the pill and swallowed it.</span><br><span>Jie Tian&rsquo;s lips curled into a sinister smile. &ldquo;I lied. It isn&rsquo;t a pill to alleviate your fatigue but a poison pill.&rdquo;</span><br><span>He took out a token that emanated the same aura as the poison pill. He formed a hand seal and fused the token into his palm. He gleefully paraded the token imprint on his hand as he said, &ldquo;You should know what this is. From now on, your life is in my hands.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;W-why would you?&rdquo; Chu Feng exclaimed with feigned anger and confusion.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re different from other formation entities. You have your self-will, but I&rsquo;m used to having everything under my control. It gives me peace of mind. You don&rsquo;t need to be too worried. I&rsquo;ll eventually give you the antidote as long as you remain obedient to me. I&rsquo;ll even give you credit where it&rsquo;s due. You should take a quick breather. My test isn&rsquo;t finished yet,&rdquo; Jie Tian said.</span><br><span>He tossed another pill onto the ground, right in front of Chu Feng. &ldquo;This pill will really alleviate your exhaustion.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Following that, Jie Tian took his leave.</span><br><span>Chu Feng could tell that this pill would indeed alleviate his exhaustion, but he didn&rsquo;t consume it. Instead, he lay on the ground and pondered about what had just happened.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, was the pill you just swallowed really a poison pill?&rdquo; Eggy asked worriedly.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a poison pill, but it&rsquo;s forged specifically against formation entities. Even though I might look no different from a formation entity on the surface, I am only enveloped in a layer of spirit power. That poison pill doesn&rsquo;t work on me at all. Eggy, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are you certain?&rdquo; Eggy was still worried.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Of course. I knew that it was a poison pill right from the start. I swallowed it because I knew it wouldn&rsquo;t work on me,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is what he threw on the ground a poison pill too?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That pill isn&rsquo;t a poison pill. It does alleviate one&rsquo;s exhaustion, but it only works on formation entities,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;No wonder you didn&rsquo;t eat it.&rdquo; Eggy heaved a sigh of relief.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not because the pill doesn&rsquo;t work on me that I didn&rsquo;t eat it. I did it intentionally. Since I&rsquo;m going to put on a show, I might as well go all the way. A normal person who just consumed a poison pill wouldn&rsquo;t eat a second one right away,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Were you feigning exhaustion when you deciphered the formation earlier too?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Oh? You could tell?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Of course. Did you think that you could deceive me? That formation was formidable, but it isn&rsquo;t so strong as to be able to exhaust you so much,&rdquo; Eggy said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Heh! I knew that I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to deceive Milady Queen. Yes, I did it on purpose. Jie Tian likely brought me here because he needs my help, but I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s a very trusting person. It&rsquo;d be best for me not to stand out too much. I should barely satisfy his requirement so that he doesn&rsquo;t feel threatened by me. He wants a person he can use and control,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;As expected of you! Jie Tian might be smart, but he&rsquo;s still nowhere on par with you,&rdquo; Eggy exclaimed gleefully.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Jie Tian is indeed a formidable individual. He&rsquo;s definitely one of the strongest juniors in the world of cultivation. I can tell that he is a vicious person, so it would be best for me to tread carefully around him. On top of that, the recovery pill and poison pill are not made by Jie Tian but a formation entity. There&rsquo;s likely to be a bigger scheme here,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>Chu Feng dared not to take Jie Tian lightly despite having outwitted the latter. He had a feeling that there was a mastermind behind Jie Tian.</span><br><span>Two hours later, Jie Tian returned. He looked at the pill that was still lying on the ground and sneered. He was mocking Chu Feng&rsquo;s cowardice, though this was exactly what he wanted too. He was gleeful at having tamed a ferocious beast like Chu Feng.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; Jie Tian ordered before heading out.</span><br><span>He brought Chu Feng into his residence before heading into an underground palace. This underground palace didn&rsquo;t appear to be a part of the residence, suggesting that Jie Tian had created this space by himself.</span><br><span>The underground palace had a long corridor filled with all kinds of obstacles. These obstacles were created with the Star Sea Realm&rsquo;s treasures, and their defensive prowess far surpassed Jie Tian&rsquo;s current strength.</span><br><span>But most important of all, Chu Feng could feel extremely potent evil power suffusing his body. He had been unable to detect the source of the evil power previously, but he was certain now that the evil power came from this underground palace.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Could it be that Jie Tian has joined the defectors?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng was taken aback, but instead of losing his nerves, he trembled with excitement. In truth, he had no intention of helping Jie Tian. It was just that he had no choice but to </span><span>obey the dispatch due to the primal elder&rsquo;s dispatch token.</span><br><span>But if Jie Tian had betrayed the Star Sea Realm, Chu Feng might just be able to gather invaluable information from him by staying with him. He might just be able to turn the tables on Jie Tian.</span></p></div>
