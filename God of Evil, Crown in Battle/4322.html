        <h1>Chapter 4321</h1>
        <div>: Xiaoxiao Is In Danger<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;What else do you want?&rdquo; Long Pingfeng grumbled in irritation.<br>While he knew that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was of high standing, no matter what, he was still a young master of the Dragon Clan. Having kneeled down and admitted his fault, he felt that he had already done all he could to ask for forgiveness. If the Ox-nosed Old Daoist still wasn&rsquo;t willing to let the matter go after this, that would be his own problem.<br>&ldquo;Just as I thought, a complete lack of manners.&rdquo;<br>In the face of the fuming Long Pingfeng, the Ox-nosed Daoist simply smiled wryly.<br>By the side, Long Duan had also fully understood the intention of the Ox-nosed Daoist too. He pointed his finger at Long Pingfeng and the others and bellowed, &ldquo;Ignorant fools, how dare you talk back to Lord Ox? Slap yourselves!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Supreme Elder, I&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Long Pingfeng felt so wronged that he could burst into tears on the spot.<br>To him, it was already a humiliation in itself for him to apologize to Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Daoist, but Long Duan actually wanted him to slap himself before the two of them on top of that!<br>What would become of his reputation if he were to do so?<br>&ldquo;What are you dazing out for? Didn&rsquo;t you hear Elder Long Duan&rsquo;s orders?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Other than Long Nanxun, all of you are to slap yourselves.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if you haven&rsquo;t shown any disrespect to Lord Ox, you have stood idly by the side and allowed such insolence to happen. That is deserving of punishment as well.&rdquo;<br>The other Supreme Elders spoke up as well.<br>Facing such a situation, there was no way Long Pingfeng and the others would dare to hesitate. No matter how unwilling they were, they had no choice to slap themselves.<br>Pah pah pah pah!<br>Crisp sounds reminiscent of firecrackers echoed loudly before the imposing entrance of the Dragon Clan.<br>But these humiliating sounds were coming from the clan members of the Dragon Clan themselves. They were kneeling on the floor, slapping themselves.<br>The clan members who served Long Pingfeng were all kneeling on the ground, swinging their powerful arms toward their own cheeks. This was a direct order from a Supreme Elder, so they didn&rsquo;t dare to hold back at all.<br>As a result, it only took a short moment for them to start bleeding. All of their faces swiftly swelled up like pig heads.<br>Even Long Nanxun was shocked to see such a sight unfolding right before his eyes, let alone the outsiders.<br>One must know that they were in the territory of the Dragon Clan, right before the entrance of its base.<br>Just how formidable must one be to make the clan members of the Dragon Clan, including one of their young masters, to kneel down to mere outsiders and slap themselves?<br>But the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and Chu Feng managed to pull off such a feat.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, if it&rsquo;s within your means to do so, please help Xiaoxiao.&rdquo;<br>A voice suddenly drifted into Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears. It was from Long Nanxun.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart squeezed a little. He realized that Long Xiaoxiao was in trouble.<br>&ldquo;Long Xiaoxiao? What happened to her?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked discreetly through voice transmission.<br>&ldquo;Her situation isn&rsquo;t very optimistic at the moment. She might be in a life-threatening position right now. All of us are powerless to help her, but perhaps&hellip; you might be able to save her,&rdquo; Long Nanxuan replied.<br>Chu Feng was alarmed to learn that Long Xiaoxiao was in such grave danger, but there wasn&rsquo;t any time for him to enquire more deeply into it.<br>This was because Long Duan and the others had already found out about the matter concerning the Dragon Vein Source<br>Due to that, they didn&rsquo;t waste too much time here. Right after punishing Long Pingfeng and the others, Long Duan invited the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and Chu Feng into the Dragon Clan.<br>So, Chu Feng requested to have Long Nanxun come along with them as well.<br>By convention, while Long Nanxun was a young master of the Dragon Clan and was of lofty standing, he wasn&rsquo;t qualified to get involved in what was going to happen next.<br>However, out of consideration of how important the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was to them right now, Long Duan made an exception and permitted the request.<br>On the way there, Long Nanxun used voice transmission to explain the situation concerning Long Xiaoxiao to Chu Feng.<br>Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother and Long Mumu&rsquo;s mother were in a hostile relationship with one another, and they had been competing with one another both on the surface and in the shadows over the years.<br>But in the past few years, Long Mumu&rsquo;s mother had managed to claim the upper hand in the fight. Not too long ago, she even framed Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother and overthrew her for good.<br>As a result, Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother was thrown in prison, and she was cruelly tortured by formations every single day.<br>Long Xiaoxiao herself was implicated in the matter as well. While her plight wasn&rsquo;t as bad as her mother&rsquo;s, she was still placed in confinement.<br>Those who had tried to plead on the behalf of Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother, be it Long Busheng or the others, they, too, were placed in confinement.<br>That incident had major rippling effects, and it implicated quite a lot of people. It showed everyone the attitude the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had toward Long Xiaoxiao and her mother.<br>If this were to go on, it was only a matter of time before Long Xiaoxiao was sidelined in the Dragon Clan.<br>If Long Mumu&rsquo;s mother was allowed to continue acting as she pleased, it was only a matter of time before Long Xiaoxiao and her mother lost their lives.<br>After all, Long Mumu and her mother were both callous individuals. From the very start, they had never intended to allow Long Xiaoxiao and her mother to live.<br>All in all, just like what Long Nanxun had said, Long Xiaoxiao really wasn&rsquo;t in a good position at all.<br>Having learned of this matter, Chu Feng was also put in a spot.<br>Putting aside the fact that he had a good impression of Long Xiaoxiao, just by how the latter kept going around calling him &lsquo;benefactor&rsquo;, he couldn&rsquo;t allow anything to happen to her.<br>However, it wouldn&rsquo;t be easy for him to intervene in this matter. He would be up against a true powerhouse of the Holy Light Galaxy, the Dragon Clan, not to mention that the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was involved in this matter as well.<br>Even the clan members of the Dragon Clan wouldn&rsquo;t dare to interfere in the Clan Chief&rsquo;s household affairs, so what could Chu Feng possibly do to help as an outsider?<br>This left Chu Feng in a difficult position.<br>While Chu Feng was still deep in thoughts, he arrived before the resplendent palace above the clouds under Long Duan&rsquo;s lead.<br>But this time, not only was Chu Feng allowed to enter the premises, he could do so openly without any worries.<br>At this moment, the most powerful figures in the Dragon Clan were all gathered inside the palace.<br>As soon as Chu Feng stepped into the premises, he could immediately feel their powerful presence.<br>There was no one here who should be underestimated. Every single glance directed in Chu Feng&rsquo;s direction felt like an invisible mountain crushing down on him.<br>However, Chu Feng was a person who had weathered through storms. Such a situation wasn&rsquo;t enough to intimidate him. Instead, he began to observe his surroundings carefully.<br>The first thing that came to his eye was the black-haired elder sitting on the main seat in the room.<br>He had a lanky figure, but his eyes felt like those of a carnivorous beast, commanding deference from others naturally even though he wasn&rsquo;t releasing any oppressive might at all.<br>He outshadowed every single person in this room in terms of presence.<br>And he was no other than the incumbent master of the Dragon Clan, the birth father of Long Xiaoxiao and Long Mumu, Clan Chief Long Ao.<br>Long Duan had already informed the Clan Chief Long Ao about Ox-nose and Chu Feng to him, as well as the happenings in the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain, right after arriving in the room.<br>His aim was to let everyone understand just how important the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and Chu Feng was to the Dragon Clan.<br>Initially, the other Supreme Elders couldn&rsquo;t even be bothered to spare Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist a glance, but after Long Duan said his piece, they began to re-evaluate the two men standing before them.<br>The same went for Clan Chief Long Ao too.<br>Afterward, the Clan Chief and the Supreme Elders even personally led Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist to where the Dragon Vein Source was.<br>The Dragon Vein Source was a little different from the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Ground.<br></p></div>
