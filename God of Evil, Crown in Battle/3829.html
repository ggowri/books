Then, she asked, &ldquo;Why did you come to the Reincarnation Upper Realm?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I came to find Grandmaster Yuan Shu for some business," said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all?&rdquo; asked Yin Zhuanghong.<br>&ldquo;More or less," said Chu Feng.<br>Hearing those words, Yin Zhuanghong revealed a look of guilt.<br>She looked at the title plate in her hand and then looked at Chu Feng. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What are you thanking me for? Giving this opportunity to you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish. Come on, go in.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I want to see Grandmaster Yuan Shu, I will be able to see him sooner or later,&rdquo; Chu Feng said in a very indifferent manner. Furthermore, he even gestured with his hand to indicate to Yin Zhuanghong to quickly enter the spirit formation gate.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave just yet. Wait for me outside,&rdquo; Yin Zhuanghong said to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Why? Do you need me for something?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>Yin Zhuanghong did not answer Chu Feng. Instead, holding the title plate in hand, she leapt forward and towards the enormous spirit formation gate.<br>With the title plate in hand, Yin Zhuanghong managed to smoothly enter the spirit formation gate.<br>Seeing that, Chu Feng also leapt forward and arrived before the spirit formation gate.<br>Chu Feng did not enter. Instead, he stopped in front of the spirit formation gate.<br>Using his hand, Chu Feng tested to see if he could pass through the gate. He discovered that the spirit formation gate was completely impenetrable, and that his palm was simply unable to pass through it at all.<br>This meant that unless one possessed a title plate, it was simply impossible to pass through the spirit formation gate.<br>Fortunately, he had not attempted to directly enter the gate like Yin Zhuanghong had.<br>Otherwise, not only would he not have been able to pass through it, but he would also have badly injured himself by smashing into the gate.<br>Seeing that it was impossible for him to meet Grandmaster Yuan Shu now, Chu Feng decided to give up.<br>He returned the way he'd come, and discovered that Fan Chou and the others had disappeared. Likely, they&rsquo;d already left.<br>Soon, Chu Feng arrived at the palace where Fan Chou and the others had been previously, and stepped into the spirit formation gate left behind by Lord White Gown.<br>Chu Feng had thought that he would return to the other palace by entering the spirit formation gate.<br>However, after passing through the spirit formation gate, Chu Feng discovered that he'd been mistaken.<br>After passing through the gate, Chu Feng arrived at a small plaza. Below the small plaza was the path down the mountain.<br>At that moment, the corners of Chu Feng&rsquo;s lips rose into a faint curve.<br>&ldquo;Never would I have expected senior White Gown to be someone to hold a grudge.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng still remembered why Lord White Gown had opened the spirit formation gate.<br>The spirit formation gate appeared after Li Xiao and the others had complained about how only a single person of the younger generation could meet Grandmaster Yuan Shu.<br>After the spirit formation gate had appeared, Lord White Gown&rsquo;s voice was heard. He had informed those younger generations that if they wanted to give up, they could leave through the spirit formation gate.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng realized why passing through the spirit formation gate did not return him to the palace he spoke to Lord White Gown in, but instead sent him to the path down the mountain.<br>Likely, it was because Lord White Gown had been displeased by those younger generations&rsquo; complaints, and had decided to directly put the exit of the spirit formation gate on the path down the mountain.<br>His intention was to teach the people who gave up a lesson.<br>&ldquo;Oh my, if it isn&rsquo;t Asura? What brought you out so quickly?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;And here I thought you&rsquo;d be the person who&rsquo;d end up seeing Grandmaster Yuan Shu. Turns out, you&rsquo;re not that special either.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;An old freak who trained for many years actually lost to a person of the younger generation, you are truly a disgrace.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, voices filled with mockery sounded in succession. Then, figures appeared in all directions.<br>Chu Feng recognized all of those people. They were Li Xiao, Meng Rufei and the others.<br>They were not only mocking Chu Feng, but the gazes that with which they looked at him were also filled with hostility.<br>Their eyes were filled with looks of grievance. They seemed like they were itching to tear Chu Feng to pieces.<br>Of course, there were many people standing behind them.<br>Some were purely passersby.<br>However, among them were people of the older generation that were clearly the seniors of Li Xiao and others.<br>Seeing that, Chu Feng knew that those people wanted to retaliate against him.<br>The reason why they had such nerve was because their seniors were standing behind them.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? Just because you can&rsquo;t win against me yourselves, you all decided to find helpers?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>Although they&rsquo;d found seniors to help them, Chu Feng was able to sense that the strongest of those seniors of theirs were only peak Exalted.<br>That was not a cultivation Chu Feng feared.<br>Although Chu Feng&rsquo;s actual cultivation was only that of a rank five Exalted, if he were to go all-out, those peak Exalted-level experts might not necessarily be a match for him.<br>&ldquo;What a &lsquo;can&rsquo;t win against you'!"<br>&ldquo;As a senior, you bullied those who are younger and weaker than you! Yet, you have the nerve to say that?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today, this old man shall properly teach you a lesson, you shameless fellow!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a furious shout was heard. It came from an old man with a white beard.<br>At the same time as his furious shout sounded, an oppressive might swept forth.<br>That person was a peak Exalted-level existence.<br>Judging from the title plate on his waist, it could be seen that that person came from the same sect as Li Xiao.<br>He was likely Li Xiao&rsquo;s senior.<br></p></div>
