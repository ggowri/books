        <div> - Change To One&rsquo;s Brothers<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you all doing? Not only did you all stop training, but you're even drinking? Have you all gone mad?!"<br>Right at that moment, a shout filled with anger suddenly sounded from the direction of the volcano.<br>"How many times has big brother Tianyi and I said to you all that this volcano will not exist forever, that we cannot be lazy, and must cherish this opportunity," following that, another voice was heard.<br>Chu Feng looked toward the direction of the voice, and saw two silhouettes on top of the volcano. They were currently flying in his direction.<br>They were Chu Feng's good brothers that he hadn&rsquo;t seen in a long time, Zhang Tianyi and Jiang Wushang.<br>Earlier, the person with the highest level of cultivation amongst the crowd was someone that had reached Half Martial Ancestor. However, that person's cultivation was now already unworthy of even being mentioned.<br>After all, both Zhang Tianyi and Jiang Wushang had reached rank nine Half Martial Ancestor.<br>Their progress was truly enormous.<br>Chu Feng was certain that among the people in the Holy Land of Martialism at present, Zhang Tianyi and Jiang Wushang's cultivations were undoubtedly the strongest.<br>It was no wonder that no one dared to enter the depths of the volcano, but Zhang Tianyi and Jiang Wushang dared to do so.<br>Seeing those two brothers that had gone through trials and tribulations with him in the past, Chu Feng felt extremely emotional. In fact, the very instant he saw them, his face blossomed with a joyous smile.<br>However, after Chu Feng carefully inspected the two of them, Chu Feng became laden with grief.<br>The great majority of the people present had been affected to a greater or lesser degree by that volcano. However, in terms of people that were affected the most, they would be none other than Chu Feng's two best brothers.<br>Even though they did not reveal anything, Chu Feng was able to feel that the two of them were covered in evil tendencies.<br>"Tianyi, Wushang, we are not being lazy! Instead, our great hero has returned!" Someone shouted from the crowd.<br>"Great hero?"<br>Zhang Tianyi and Jiang Wushang were not joyous upon hearing those words. Chu Feng noticed that the two of them actually revealed a displeased expression.<br>They seemed to be extremely fed up with the words 'great hero' being used to describe someone else.<br>"Look at who this is!" Following that, Chu Feng's big brother Monkey who stood beside him pointed to Chu Feng whilst shouting.<br>It was only at that moment that Zhang Tianyi and Jiang Wushang's gazes landed on Chu Feng.<br>"Chu Feng?"<br>When the two of them saw Chu Feng, the expressions of displeasure on their faces disappeared instantly, and were replaced with ecstasy.<br>"My junior brother, you've returned."<br>"Big brother Chu Feng, when did you return? Your little brother has missed you to death."<br>At that moment, those two arrogant and haughty men, who were standing high above everyone else, reacted as if they'd returned to the world of mortals and regained human emotions.<br>Simultaneously, they arrived beside Chu Feng. They were extremely excited.<br>Seeing this, Xian Lingyue revealed a different expression in her eyes.<br>It had been a very long time since Zhang Tianyi and Jiang Wushang revealed that sort of smile. Ever since the volcano appeared, the two of them had been going deeper and deeper into the volcano to train. As their cultivations increased, the two of them began to grow extremely arrogant and condescending.<br>Although they had not explicitly stated their desire to rule, their every word and action were all incomparably arrogant. Gradually, they had become the rulers of the entire Holy Land of Martialism. No one dared to go against them.<br>However at that moment, Xian Lingyue felt as if she had once again seen the familiar Zhang Tianyi and Jiang Wushang. She felt as if she were witnessing the return of those two genial fellows.<br>Xian Lingyue knew that the change to Zhang Tianyi and Jiang Wushang was all due to one person -- Chu Feng.<br>Xian Lingyue became more certain that if there was someone that could help the crowd stop relying on the volcano to train, that person must be Chu Feng.<br>Only Chu Feng held such weight in the hearts of the crowd.<br>After finding out that the crowd had only stopped their training and set up an enormous banquet because it was Chu Feng that had returned, Zhang Tianyi and Jiang Wushang not only stopped feeling unhappy, but instead revealed joyous expressions, and joined in the participation of the feast.<br>The two of them were soon seated beside Chu Feng and drinking with him happily.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, how&rsquo;s the Outer World? How&rsquo;s that Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm? Is the scenery there more beautiful than that of our Holy Land of Martialism? Are the girls there prettier than the ones from our Holy Land of Martialism?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right, exactly how powerful are the martial cultivators there? Are they truly that much more powerful than us?&rdquo;Jiang Wushang asked curiously. From his gaze, one could tell how much he looked forward to the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>&ldquo;The scenery of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm is indeed very beautiful. There are a lot of impressive sights. However, the way I see it, the most beautiful place would be our Nine Provinces Continent, our Eastern Sea Region and the Holy Land of Martialism,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Haha, junior brother Chu Feng, I like those words of yours. No matter how beautiful a foreign land might be, its beauty will still be inferior to that of one&rsquo;s homeland,&rdquo; Zhang Tianyi burst into loud laughter.<br>&ldquo;As for cultivation, the people of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm do generally possess stronger cultivations than those of the people from the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm,&rdquo; Chu Feng continued.<br>&ldquo;In that case, big brother Chu Feng, how do you think I would do should I enter the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm now?&rdquo; Jiang Wushang asked.<br>&ldquo;For you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was planning to answer Jiang Wushang. However, right at that moment, Zhang Tianyi interrupted, &ldquo;Wushang, aren&rsquo;t you making things difficult for Chu Feng by asking that sort of question? How could he see through your cultivation now?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng smiled lightly. He swallowed the words that he had been about to say.<br>&ldquo;Junior brother Chu Feng, please don&rsquo;t be offended by my words. Although it is a publicly accepted truth that you are more talented than Wushang and I, with the appearance of that Sacred Mountain, Wushang and I are already no longer comparable to how we were in the past. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that we wanted our cultivation to become even stronger, the two of us would&rsquo;ve already left for the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm to find you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, junior brother Chu Feng, you also do not have to feel discouraged. The Sacred Mountain is still here. With your talent, as long as you put forth the effort to train, it is only a matter of time before you will surpass us again.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, don&rsquo;t rush to leave since you&rsquo;ve returned. Stay a while longer, and enjoy training in the Sacred Mountain with us. When the Sacred Mountain disappears, we can proceed for the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm together,&rdquo; Zhang Tianyi said to Chu Feng.<br>Although Zhang Tianyi did not state it explicitly, he had implied that the current Chu Feng was inferior to him and Jiang Wushang.<br>&ldquo;This Zhang Tianyi actually became so arrogant in a short few years. Who gave him the guts to act like this?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen muttered in displeasure upon hearing what Zhang Tianyi said.<br>Compared to Her Lady Queen, Chu Feng did not say much. He was also not angry because of what Zhang Tianyi said.<br>Chu Feng knew that it was not Zhang Tianyi&rsquo;s actual intention. Had it been Zhang Tianyi from before, he would not speak like that even if his cultivation had truly surpassed Chu Feng&rsquo;s.<br>The reason why Zhang Tianyi was so arrogant now was most definitely because he was affected by that volcano.<br></p></div>
