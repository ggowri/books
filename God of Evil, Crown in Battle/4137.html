        <h1>Chapter 4136</h1>
        <div> - Stunning Everyone<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though they were thoroughly shocked by Chu Feng, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen were not worried about Zuoqiu Tiancheng.<br>The reason for that was because they knew that Zuoqiu Tiancheng had also unlocked the restrictions of their bloodline at the Utmost Exalted realm.<br>So what if Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent and battle power surpassed Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s?<br>At the very least, he would still not be a match at that moment.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng&rsquo;s original cultivation was weaker than Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s.<br>When this thought crossed their minds, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen suddenly felt at ease.<br>So what if Chu Feng had exceptional talent? In the end, he&rsquo;d still die there.<br>In the end, he&rsquo;d still be killed by their young master Tiancheng.<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng mocked Zuoqiu Tiancheng, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? Are you afraid to release your Lightning Mark?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You must be afraid that people will see the disparity between our Lightning Marks and end up wounding your ego, right?&rdquo;<br>Once Chu Feng said those words, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen were all stunned.<br>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;This guy knows that our young master Tiancheng is also capable of releasing the power of his Lightning Mark?&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;If he knows, why isn&rsquo;t he afraid? Why is he instead provoking young master Tiancheng?&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;Could it be that he has a deathwish?&rsquo;<br>Actually, what Chu Feng had said was correct.<br>That was indeed the reason why Zuoqiu Tiancheng was unwilling to release his Lightning Mark.<br>However, as matters stood he was being suppressed by Chu Feng. As such, even though he was unwilling he had no choice but to release his Lightning Mark.<br>&ldquo;Afraid? I merely didn&rsquo;t want you to die too ugly of a death.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Zzzzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Lightning flickered as a &lsquo;Divine&rsquo; character appeared on Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s forehead.<br>Upon releasing his Divine-level Lightning Mark, Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s cultivation immediately increased.<br>From rank two Utmost Exalted, it increased to rank three Utmost Exalted.<br>Although Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s cultivation had increased, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen had no choice but to accept the fact that there was an enormous distinction between the &lsquo;Divine&rsquo; character on Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s forehead and the one on Chu Feng&rsquo;s forehead.<br>The distinction was not only in terms of their intensity.<br>Heavenly Bloodline possessors suffered from oppression depending on the Self-punishing Mysterious Techniques they trained in.<br>Even if their cultivations surpassed the person with the stronger Self-punishing Mysterious Technique, they&rsquo;d still experience that oppression.<br>The oppression brought forth by Chu Feng was much stronger than the one brought forth by Zuoqiu Tiancheng.<br>Indeed, Chu Feng&rsquo;s Lightning Mark was far stronger than Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s.<br>At that moment, they couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder...<br>&lsquo;Could it be that the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique our young master Tiancheng trained in is really incomplete?&rsquo;<br>&ldquo;Prepare to die!&rdquo; Zuoqiu Tiancheng attacked.<br>His attack this time around was a rank nine Immortal Technique.<br>The rank nine Immortal Technique turned into countless sharp swords that were densely packed together as they shot straight towards Chu Feng.<br>However, Chu Feng did not attempt to dodge the attack at all.<br>Because of that, the sharp swords all hit him.<br>Stuck by the sword, an overwhelming amount of energy ripples surged forth.<br>&ldquo;Zzzzz~~~&rdquo;<br>However, lightning soon flashed in the energy ripples.<br>Then, the energy ripples started scattering.<br>Upon seeing what emerged, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen simply did not dare believe their eyes.<br>Chu Feng was completely unscathed. He had managed to take Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s attack head-on.<br>The reason why Chu Feng had been able to face Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s rank nine Immortal Technique was because his cultivation had increased. Chu Feng was no longer a rank two Utmost Exalted, but a rank three Utmost Exalted.<br>What had increased his cultivation was the change to his body.<br>Surging lightning had gathered on his body and had formed armor that covered him.<br>That was the Lightning Armor!<br>&ldquo;That brat actually managed to unseal the power of the Lightning Armor?&rdquo;<br>Even the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief felt disbelief.<br>He knew very well that Zuoqiu Tiancheng had also unsealed both his Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor before he had reached the Utmost Exalted realm.<br>However, after reaching the Utmost Exalted realm, all of his bloodline powers had ended up being sealed again.<br>It was already extremely amazing that Zuoqiu Tiancheng had been able to unseal his Lightning Mark.<br>Yet Chu Feng had actually managed to unseal both the Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor? This was simply unfathomable.<br>One should know that Chu Feng&rsquo;s actual cultivation was only that of rank one Utmost Exalted.<br>Even though there were powerful existences in the Holy Light Galaxy&rsquo;s Upper Starfields that had managed to unseal two bloodline powers, they were all people that had trained bitterly for years, and had utilized treasures or medicinal pellets to assist them.<br>It was the first time that the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had witnessed someone unsealing two bloodline powers at once the moment they reached the Utmost Exalted Realm.<br>Furthermore, from the way it looked, it was clear that Chu Feng had not utilized any treasures or medicinal pellets to assist him.<br>He had not relied on any external help, and had unsealed two bloodline powers with his own ability.<br>This was simply unheard of, simply unprecedented.<br>Suddenly, a furious shout was heard, &ldquo;You bastard! That power should&rsquo;ve belonged to me! That was mine!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You stole the power that should&rsquo;ve belonged to me! I am going to dismember you into ten thousand pieces! I&rsquo;ll make sure you die a miserable death!&rdquo;<br>It was Zuoqiu Tiancheng.<br>Seeing the Lightning Armor on Chu Feng&rsquo;s body his anger soared once more. He was on the verge of being driven mad with anger.<br>He felt that if it weren&rsquo;t for Chu Feng, the Divine Lightning Affliction that had arrived would&rsquo;ve belonged to him. He should have been the one to make a breakthrough in cultivation and unseal the power of the Lightning Armor.<br>Yet all of that had been stolen from him by Chu Feng.<br>It was Chu Feng who had caused him to have nothing at all.<br>As he shouted furiously at Chu Feng, he sucked his lost Incomplete Exalted Armament back into his grasp.<br>He planned to attack Chu Feng with a martial skill.<br>&ldquo;Paa~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right after he raised his Incomplete Exalted Armament, before he could even unleash his attack, a hand grabbed his wrist and stopped him.<br>At that moment, the furious Zuoqiu Tiancheng who was overflowing with killing intent suddenly found himself stunned.<br>It was Chu Feng. Not only had Chu Feng arrived before him, but he had also stopped his attack.<br>Most importantly, at the instant when Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand grabbed Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s wrist, Zuoqiu Tiancheng realized the disparity between him and Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my turn now.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng clenched his fist. &lsquo;Snap!&rsquo; Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s wrist had been crushed.<br>The injury was not only an injury to his physical body, it was also an injury to his soul.<br>Zuoqiu Tiancheng had been pampered and spoiled all his life. When had he ever experienced such torment?<br>As such, once his wrist was crushed, he immediately started screaming miserably in pain.<br>However, right after he screamed, Chu Feng&rsquo;s attack came again. Chu Feng had raised his leg and kicked Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s leg, breaking it.<br>Zuoqiu Tiancheng fell to the ground and began rolling around in miserable pain. He had evidently lost all ability to fight.<br>Everyone had thought Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s battle power to be extremely strong.<br>Never would they have imagined that he would be completely powerless to even fight back against Chu Feng.<br>However, Chu Feng showed no signs of stopping.<br>He continued to attack Zuoqiu Tiancheng. With every attack, Zuoqiu Tiancheng found himself with more bones shattered.<br>To Zuoqiu Tiancheng, this was most definitely torture.<br>Everything Chu Feng did was observed by all the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>Because of that, those Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen all felt extremely pained.<br>However, in terms of feeling the greatest pain and distress, none could compare to Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s father, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br></p></div>
