        <h1>Chapter 4126</h1>
        <div> - Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What sort of woman was Fumo Xin&rsquo;er?<br>Before her, even women that could be considered to be beauties would lose their splendor.<br>After all, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er was a major beauty akin to a celestial fairy.<br>When Zuoqiu Tiancheng saw Fumo Xin&rsquo;er, his eyes were completely fixed in place.<br>He immediately expressed his love to her.<br>As for Fumo Xin&rsquo;er, she was in a bad mood after straying from Chu Feng and Fumo Shaoyu. Thus, how could she possibly bother with Zuoqiu Tiancheng?<br>After being rejected, Zuoqiu Tiancheng became forceful.<br>Because of that, Zuoqiu Tiancheng and Fumo Xin&rsquo;er ended up fighting in the city.<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er was very powerful, and most definitely a genius.<br>However, she was only a rank one Utmost Exalted. Against Zuoqiu Tiancheng, a rank two Utmost Exalted, she was clearly not a match.<br>As such, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er ended up being forcibly captured by Zuoqiu Tiancheng.<br>&ldquo;That damned Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan! They&rsquo;re all a bunch of scum!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That old bastard stole our cultivation treasure, and that little bastard is even more vile, he actually stole my little sister!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wipe out their entire clan!&rdquo;<br>Fumo Shaoyu gnashed his teeth with anger upon learning what had happened.<br>&ldquo;Brother Shaoyu, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan came prepared. There are most likely a lot of experts among their people that came here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We cannot use force. We must outsmart them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Fortunately, the tracking talisman is still able to track Fumo Xin&rsquo;er. My world spirit techniques should come in handy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let us rescue your sister first,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Mn. Right. Let&rsquo;s rescue my lil' sis first. We can&rsquo;t allow her to be married to that sort of bastard,&rdquo; said Fumo Shaoyu.<br>After they made their decision, Chu Feng and Fumo Shaoyu set off.<br>They pursued Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&hellip;...<br>Heaven-devouring Starfield. Heavenly Lightning Upper Realm. Central region.<br>There was an ancient grand formation here.<br>There was no trace of spirit power in that grand formation. It was composed of piled up stone.<br>Those stones were no ordinary stones. They were extremely tough. They were uncommon treasures.<br>However, those stones were covered in cracks. They were so beaten that it seemed like they could shatter at any moment.<br>The stones were covered in runes and symbols.<br>If Chu Feng saw those runes and symbols, he would definitely gasp in admiration at how powerful the person who had left those runes and symbols was.<br>That place was the renowned Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.<br>It was said that the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation could help those with Heavenly Bloodlines reach a breakthrough.<br>Moreover, it was said that there were several people after the Ancient Era that had managed to achieve breakthroughs using the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.<br>That said, it was not that easy of a task to use the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.<br>Activating it was extremely expensive.<br>To put it simply, precious natural treasures were needed.<br>As such, there were a lot of people that wanted to use the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation to make a breakthrough. However, very few people were actually able to do so.<br>Furthermore, the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation had limited usage.<br>The cracks in the stones served as the best testimony.<br>Judging from the intensity of the cracks, the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation could most likely only be used one or two more times.<br>With that, the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation would be completely destroyed, and disappear from this world.<br>That said, the people from the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan were not concerned with whether or not the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation would be destroyed.<br>They were only concerned with whether or not Zuoqiu Tiancheng could make a breakthrough.<br>They felt that Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s inability to make a breakthrough was very likely because he had encountered the legendary Divine Lightning Affliction.<br>The Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan had only heard about the Divine Lightning Affliction, and had never witnessed it.<br>However, they knew of the Divine Lightning Affliction&rsquo;s benefits, and also knew that the earlier one encountered it, the more talented they were.<br>Because of that, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan did not hesitate to spend a huge sum to purchase natural treasures in order to activate the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.<br>They were determined to nurture Zuoqiu Tiancheng and have him lead their Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan to new heights.<br>Because of that, countless experts from the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan had come to the Heavenly Lightning Upper Realm.<br>Even the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had come.<br>The experts of the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan were all gathered outside the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.<br>They&rsquo;d set up camp outside the formation for the sake of activating it.<br>Many extravagant palaces were constructed here, surrounding the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.<br>The Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was standing at the top of a palace and looking down. He was able to see the entire Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.<br>Standing beside the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was a young man.<br>That young man had an extraordinary appearance.<br>He was the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s other genius, Zuoqiu Daoyi.<br>Zuoqiu Daoyi and Zuoqiu Tiancheng were brothers. They were both biological sons of the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>Moreover, they shared the same mother too.<br>Because of that, Zuoqiu Daoyi and Zuoqiu Tiancheng were blood brothers of the closest bloodline.<br>&ldquo;Daoyi, for the sake of having your brother successfully reach a breakthrough, I&rsquo;ve made a huge fuss over things. Do you think that father is being unfair?&rdquo; The Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief looked to Zuoqiu Daoyi.<br>&ldquo;Father, back then, you gave me the opportunity to learn the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is I who was insufficiently talented. I failed to master the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique. That&rsquo;s why I ended up learning the Heaven Punishment Mysterious Technique.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;My brother is able to learn the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique. That itself is proof that his talent is above my own.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;At such a young age, he encountered the legendary Divine Lightning Affliction. That serves to further prove how exceptionally talented he is. His future prospects are unbounded.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Father, not only should you fully support my brother&rsquo;s growth, even I should do the same,&rdquo; said Zuoqiu Daoyi.<br>The Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief sighed. &ldquo;Daoyi, you are truly sensible.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh how great it would be if your brother were as sensible as you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Tiancheng is also extremely hardworking with his cultivation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for women, he&rsquo;s a man. It is normal for him to like women,&rdquo; Zuoqiu Daoyi said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re also a man. How come you&rsquo;re not like your little brother? How come you don&rsquo;t marry a daughter-in-law for me every other day?&rdquo; the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>&ldquo;In the future, I will have to assist my brother.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since my talent is lacking, I will naturally have to work even harder. Else&hellip; how am I supposed to assist him?&rdquo; said Zuoqiu Daoyi.<br>Hearing those words, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief nodded in satisfaction.<br>Even though he also felt that Zuoqiu Daoyi was better suited to handle general affairs, better suited to be his successor, the world of martial cultivators was one where strength ruled.<br>As such, he had long decided that the future clan chief would be Zuoqiu Tiancheng.<br>Originally, he was afraid that the brothers would fight over who would be the clan chief.<br>But after seeing how sensible Zuoqiu Daoyi was, he felt at ease.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a figure flew over and landed at the main palace.<br>That person was none other than Zuoqiu Hanxun, the old man that had stolen the lightning pearl from Chu Feng and Fumo Shaoyu.<br></p></div>
