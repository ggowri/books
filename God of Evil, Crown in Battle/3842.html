        <div> - Another Match<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Zhuanghong, this is that young master Asura you spoke of?&rdquo;<br>The Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster did not pay any attention to the Mystic Cave Saints. Instead, she looked to Yin Zhuanghong.<br>She had to verify the matter.<br>Only through verification could she determine if Chu Feng was friend or foe.<br>&ldquo;Master, that&rsquo;s him.&rdquo; After saying those words, Yin Zhuanghong deliberately pretended to be shocked as she asked Chu Feng, &ldquo;Asura, how did you get here?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng thought to himself, &lsquo;Who would&rsquo;ve expected that this girl actually knows how to play dumb?&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;You clearly already knew that I&rsquo;d come long ago, yet you&rsquo;re asking me that sort of question. Quite the good show you&rsquo;re putting on here.&rsquo;<br>&ldquo;Young master Asura, how did you arrive at this place?&rdquo; The Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster also turned her gaze to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;My apologies, Lady Headmaster. I heard that the Red-dress Holy Land had an important gamble today and, out of curiosity, decided to come and check it out.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, as I was afraid of affecting you all with my presence, I decided to conceal myself with some abilities and snuck in here,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a clasped fist.<br>&ldquo;Some abilities?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young master Asura, you&rsquo;re truly extraordinary. Your abilities actually managed to pull the wool over our eyes.&rdquo; The elders of the Red-dress Holy Land said with smiles on their faces.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s ability to conceal himself had already caused them to have a whole new level of respect for him.<br>&ldquo;This Asura has come unsolicited. Seniors, please punish me for it.&rdquo; Chu Feng clasped his fist respectfully and spoke with an apologetic expression.<br>&ldquo;Young master Asura is an important guest. If you want to come here, we will naturally not stop you from doing so. You&rsquo;ve done nothing wrong at all." With a smile all over her face, the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster expressed that she had no intention to blame Chu Feng for what he had done.<br>&ldquo;Motherfucking hell! Damned brat, you actually dared to ignore us?! You&rsquo;re fucking courting death!&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a furious shout was heard. Then, an extremely powerful oppressive might rushed towards Chu Feng to attack him.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed.<br>The person who had sent forth the oppressive might to attack him was the Eleventh of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>It was unknown what sort of ability, he had used but he had removed the cape from his body.<br>Thus, he was able to use his martial power. That was the reason why he was able to send forth his oppressive might to attack Chu Feng.<br>His oppressive might was actually that of a peak Exalted.<br>Chu Feng did not expect that the Mystic Cave Saints would possess such powerful cultivations.<br>After all, although they were extremely shameless, they appeared very stupid, and did not resemble expert cultivators at all.<br>At the instant when Chu Feng was surprised, Eleventh&rsquo;s oppressive might arrived before him.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>However, the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster waved her sleeve, and the oppressive might immediately vanished.<br>Even though that Eleventh might be a peak Exalted, the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster was a rank three Utmost Exalted. Before her, that oppressive might was simply useless.<br>&ldquo;Mystic Cave Saints, what nerve you all have! You actually dared to unleash an attack in our Red-dress Holy Land?!&rdquo;<br>The Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s elders all glared at the Mystic Cave Saints angrily.<br>&ldquo;Humph. That brat robbed us of our treasures. What wrong is there in us teaching him a lesson?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Truly never would we have imagined that your Red-dress Holy Land is actually associated with such a shameless individual. It would appear that your Red-dress Holy Land is not some sort of upright place either," cursed the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Robbed?&rdquo;<br>After hearing what the Mystic Cave Saints said, the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s crowd grew even more confused.<br>Although the Mystic Cave Saints had bad reputations, they were still rather famous people in the All-heaven Starfield.<br>How could they possibly be robbed by Chu Feng, a person of the younger generation?<br>Confused, the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster turned to ask Chu Feng, &ldquo;Young master Asura, you have a prior conflict with the Mystic Cave Saints?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lady Headmaster, have you heard of there being cheaters that snuck their way into the Seven Suns Mountain Range&rsquo;s World Spirit Mansion Gate to snatch the treasures from the younger generations a couple days ago?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard about that," said the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster.<br>&ldquo;Senior, those cheaters that snuck their way into the World Spirit Mansion Gate are eleven." Chu Feng pointed to the Mystic Cave Saints as he spoke.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually them?&rdquo;<br>The people from the Red-dress Holy Land all felt surprised to hear those words.<br>However, their surprise only lasted for a brief moment, and was replaced by absolute certainty.<br>The reason for their rapid change in opinions was due to their understanding of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;I believe that seniors all know that the treasures in the World Spirit Mansion Gate are treasures Grandmaster Yuan Shu prepared for the people of the younger generation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Mystic Cave Saints went against the rules by sneaking in there.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of that, this junior used some tricks, and snatched back the treasures they had obtained in the World Spirit Mansion Gate.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What I&rsquo;ve done was upholding justice. It was no robbery at all," added Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, young master Asura has truly done a good thing," said the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster.<br>&ldquo;Humph! Brat, don&rsquo;t you make false accusations!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. How could we, the Mystic Cave Saints, do such a shameless thing?&rdquo;<br>The Mystic Cave Saints refused to admit to Chu Feng&rsquo;s claims.<br>&ldquo;I seem to recall that you Mystic Cave Saints have done a lot of shameless things?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thinking back to your notorious behavior, I am more willing to believe in young master Asura&rsquo;s claims," said the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re together to begin with, of course you&rsquo;ll believe him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Forget it, we won&rsquo;t bother wasting time arguing with you all. Pay the bet you&rsquo;ve lost and hand over the Spirit Formation Cultivation Bead,&rdquo; said the Mystic Cave Saints&rsquo; Eldest.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? You&rsquo;re planning to run away after winning once? Do you dare to go another round against me?&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br></p></div>
