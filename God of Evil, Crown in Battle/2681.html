        <div> - Sinister Death<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Fuck! This great sir is speaking to you?! Are you pretending to not hear me?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Your daddy, I, am telling you to scram immediately!&rdquo;<br>That robust man was immediately furious upon seeing that there was no reaction from Chu Feng. He pointed at Chu Feng and started to curse loudly. His attitude was extremely aggressive.<br>&ldquo;Have your parents not taught you that you should be polite when speaking to strangers?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;What? What are you trying to say?&rdquo;<br>The robust man revealed a confused expression. Evidently, he was startled by Chu Feng&rsquo;s words.<br>&ldquo;The reason for that is because you never know whether or not a stranger you don&rsquo;t know might be someone that you cannot afford to offend,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Motherfucker! Are you threatening me?!&rdquo; The robust man asked coldly.<br>Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, he said, &ldquo;Do you believe that I can rip your mouth apart without even moving?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Motherfucker! You dare speak to me in such a manner?! What makes you think you can do that?! With those, those two crap weapons?&rdquo; The robust man spoke mockingly.<br>The reason why he dared to act this rude toward Chu Feng was because he had never placed Chu Feng in his eyes.<br>He felt that Chu Feng was nothing more than a beggar. He found it truly ridiculous that a beggar dared to speak to him in such a manner.<br>&ldquo;Hahahaha&hellip;&rdquo; At that moment, many of the people present all burst into laughter.<br>As Chu Feng hadn&rsquo;t activated either his Divine Dragon&rsquo;s Blood Ruler or his Evil God Sword, no one was able to sense their power regardless of how strong they might be.<br>Furthermore, the outward appearance of the two weapons was indeed quite lousy.<br>&ldquo;Puchi~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, blood splattered from that robust man&rsquo;s mouth.<br>&ldquo;Ahhhhh~~~&rdquo;<br>The next moment, he let out a miserable scream.<br>At the beginning, the crowd was confused. However, when that robust man turned around, everyone was so shocked that their expressions all changed. Some even started to shiver in fear.<br>Blood covered that robust man&rsquo;s face. His chin had been completely torn to pieces. It was a very frightening sight.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? Did he do that?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, those people started to panic. It was only at that moment that they realized that the young man standing before them was not as simple as they imagined him to be.<br>Everyone removed their mocking smiles and looked to Chu Feng with fear in their eyes. It was as if they were seeing a demon.<br>Although they were all holding weapons in their hands and were still in a battle formation, not a single person dared to attack Chu Feng. On the contrary&hellip; they were all shivering and moving backwards.<br>Right at that moment, from the group of people, the person with the cultivation of rank five Martial Ancestor stood forth.<br>That person was an old man. Judging from his appearance, he should be the leader of the group. His cultivation was also the strongest among the group of people.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m from the Fallen Phoenix City&rsquo;s Zhao Mansion. I am called Zhao Pingyang,&rdquo; that old man said to Chu Feng.<br>The old man spoke with a very unyielding tone. His behavior simply did not resemble the behavior of someone trying to reconcile with someone. The only thing Chu Feng felt from his tone was a deep amount of threat.<br>Chu Feng had always been a person amenable to reason, but not coercion. Originally, he did not plan to make things difficult for those people. Even though those people had spoken rudely toward him from the very beginning, he did not do anything to them.<br>However, they were actually unable to differentiate good from bad, and dared to climb all over him, publicly insulting him. Naturally, Chu Feng would not continue to tolerate their behavior.<br>&ldquo;So what if you&rsquo;re from the Fallen Phoenix City&rsquo;s Zhao Mansion?&rdquo; Chu Feng spoke disapprovingly.<br>&ldquo;If you want to rob us, then you are most sorely mistaken. Our Zhao Mansion is not one that you can afford to provoke,&rdquo; That Zhao Pingyang said.<br>&ldquo;Oh? In that case, I&rsquo;ve already injured your man. What do you plan to do about that?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Kneel and apologize. After that, tear up your own mouth and get the hell out of here. Do not make me do it for you,&rdquo; that Zhao Pingyang waved his hand.<br>His appearance was truly arrogant. It was as if, if he wanted to, he could make Chu Feng suffer miserably at any time.<br>&ldquo;You truly do not know the immensity of the heaven and earth,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What did you say?!&rdquo; That Zhao Pingyang asked furiously.<br>Chu Feng did not answer him. Instead, he smiled coldly. The next moment, a surging oppressive might swept forth from his body toward that group of people.<br>The next moment, apart from the person with an appearance resembling Jiang Wushang that was whipped earlier, everyone else was forced onto the ground.<br>Chu Feng walked over to that old man and said, &ldquo;Do you understand what I said now?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Milord, please spare me, please spare me. I have eyes but failed to recognize Mount Tai. Please, Milord, please spare my life.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You can go ahead and take everything from this chariot. Milord, please, I beg of you, spare this lowly one.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, that old man no longer possessed his earlier threatening attitude. Instead, he began to beg for forgiveness nonstop.<br>Chu Feng actually noticed that his aged body was shivering nonstop.<br>He was also a coward who was scared of death.<br>&ldquo;Even if the things in your chariot are to be scattered on the road, I would not even bother to take a glance at them,&rdquo; Chu Feng mocked.<br>There were indeed quite a lot of treasures on the chariot. But, it was as Chu Feng said, those treasures on the chariot simply could not catch his eyes.<br>Then, Chu Feng arrived before the man with an appearance similar to that of Jiang Wushang.<br>Although Chu Feng&rsquo;s oppressive might did not affect him, he still shivered upon seeing Chu Feng approach him. Involuntarily, he began to back away from Chu Feng.<br>This was understandable too. After all, Chu Feng had revealed such overwhelming power. It would instead be strange if he wasn&rsquo;t afraid.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be scared. I have no malice against you,&rdquo; after saying those words, Chu Feng clasped his fist and said, &ldquo;I am Chu Feng. May I know how to address you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I-I-I am Song Xi,&rdquo; that man that greatly resembled Jiang Wushang was so scared that he started stuttering.<br>&ldquo;Song Xi, I have something that I need your help with. Might you be willing to help me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh. Of course, I wouldn&rsquo;t be asking for this help for free. As long as you&rsquo;re willing to help me, I will reward you for your help,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m w-willing. I&rsquo;m wi-willing to help,&rdquo; Song Xi said as he wiped away the cold sweat on his forehead.<br>Chu Feng was able to tell that this Song Xi was not willing to help. The reason for that was because he was very scared of him.<br>However, Song Xi did not dare to refuse Chu Feng. Likely, he feared that he would have his mouth torn up like that robust man should he refuse Chu Feng.<br>Unfortunately, no one else present caught Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes. It was only this Song Xi that Chu Feng felt a good impression of.<br>On the one hand, his appearance truly resembled that of Jiang Wushang. This gave Chu Feng a very familiar feeling.<br>On the other hand, Song Xi was the only good-natured individual among the group of people.<br>Only someone like this would be trustworthy.<br>Thus, Chu Feng grabbed Song Xi&rsquo;s shoulder and smiled, &ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng soared into the sky and left with Song Xi.<br>After Chu Feng left, the oppressive might that enveloped the area also disappeared.<br>The crowd that were forced onto the ground hurriedly stood back up.<br>&ldquo;Milord, are you alright?&rdquo;<br>With eager expressions on their faces, the crowd rushed toward that old man.<br>&ldquo;Scram, scram, scram!&rdquo; Zhao Pingyang shouted furiously at the crowd.<br>&ldquo;Milord, who is that brat? He actually dared to disregard our Zhao Mansion?&rdquo; An attendant asked the old man.<br>&ldquo;Paaa~~~&rdquo;<br>Right after that attendant said those words, that old man called Zhao Pingyang shot a slap at his face. The slap was so powerful that it deformed that attendant&rsquo;s entire face. His face became drenched with blood, and he started to wail in pain.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you all this, in this region, no one dares to disregard our Zhao Mansion!&rdquo; Zhao Pingyang spoke loudly.<br>The attendants were all trembling with fear. Hurriedly, they echoed, &ldquo;Yes, of course!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lil&rsquo; Six, have you remembered the appearance of that brat?&rdquo; Zhao Pingyang asked a youngster.<br>&ldquo;Milord, I have,&rdquo; that youngster by the name of Lil&rsquo; Six replied.<br>&ldquo;Immediately return to the mansion and report this matter to the Family Head. Draw a portrait of that brat and put out an order for his arrest immediately,&rdquo; Zhao Pingyang said.<br>&ldquo;Yes, Milord,&rdquo; that Lil&rsquo; Six replied. Then, he immediately turned around and began to rush toward the direction where they came from. In the blink of an eye, he had disappeared down the main road.<br>&ldquo;Motherfucker! He dared to cause a disturbance against the ruler of this place! I will definitely make him pay the price!&rdquo; Zhao Pingyang spoke as he gnashed his teeth angrily.<br>&ldquo;Ssssss~~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a strange sound emerged from the mountain.<br>&ldquo;Milord, it seems that there&rsquo;s something in the mountain,&rdquo; Someone said.<br>The crowd present all heard that voice. Involuntarily, they turned their gazes toward the direction of the voice.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a dark black gaseous flame shot out from the mountain and rapidly flew toward the crowd.<br>The speed of that dark black gaseous flame was extremely fast. In the blink of an eye, it knocked down everyone present.<br>&ldquo;Ahhh~~~&rdquo;<br>The next moment, miserable screams rose and fell in succession.<br>Soon, all the screams stopped. After the screams stopped, the dark black gaseous flame also disappeared into thin air.<br>As for the people from the Zhao Mansion, their clothes were all still completely intact. However, they were all lying on the ground with appearances similar to dried corpses. There was no trace of life to be found anywhere.<br>They had all died. Their eyes had rolled into the tops of their heads, and their mouths were wide open. It was as if all their flesh and blood was gone from their bodies. All of them were thin like skin and bones.<br>Their skin had turned greenish-black. Vein-like patterns had appeared on their greenish-black skin. The vein-like patterns were dark black in color.<br>From a glance, they looked even more frightening than ghosts. It was truly sinister.<br>That said, they were nothing more than corpses at that moment.<br><br><br></p></div>
