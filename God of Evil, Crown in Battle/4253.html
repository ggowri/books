        <h1>Chapter 4252</h1>
        <div> - Only Chance<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;I will give you all a chance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, it will be up to you as to whether or not you&rsquo;ll be able to grasp that chance.&rdquo;<br>After those words were said, the earth beneath the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain shattered completely.<br>The light coming from beneath the earth grew even more intense.<br>It was like there was a sun hidden beneath the grounds of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain.<br>Enveloped by the light, many people felt a stinging pain even with their eyes closed.<br>Even Chu Feng, someone who used the Heaven's Eyes, didn't dare look directly at the light. Instead, he closed his eyes and turned his head to avoid the light.<br>Soon, the intense light began to weaken. Once the light weakened, the crowd were once again able to look at the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain.<br>But, upon looking at it, they were all astonished.<br>Two grand formations had appeared above the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain.<br>Those two grand formations were identical. Both contained countless smaller formations within them. Mountains and rivers could also be seen inside them.<br>Rather than calling them formations, it would be more accurate to say that they were two worlds.<br>However, upon closer inspection, they discovered that they were not ordinary spirit formations. Rather, they were two chessboards.<br>However, no one present was able to tell exactly what sort of chessboard they were.<br>&ldquo;Are we supposed to solve these chess puzzles?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Will we be able to leave this place alive should we solve them?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Grandmaster Tang Chen, the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted and all the other powerful world spritists began using their strongest observational abilities to examine the two spirit formations.<br>They all wanted to quickly find a way to solve them.<br>Unfortunately, their observation methods were all ineffective. None of them were able to figure out how to solve the spirit formations.<br>Even people as powerful as Grandmaster Tang Chen were unable to do anything.<br>In fact, they didn't even know what those two spirit formations were.<br>&ldquo;Damn it! Exactly what sort of damned place is this?!&rdquo;<br>A sense of helplessness filled everyone&rsquo;s hearts and bodies.<br>One must know that, apart from the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted and the world spiritist from the Holy Light Clan, the strongest world spiritists of the Holy Light Galaxy were all gathered there, trapped there.<br>Yet, even those renowned powerful world spiritists were all powerless when facing the spirit formations before them.<br>It was a feeling akin to having one&rsquo;s cultivation crippled, and being powerless to face the threat before one&rsquo;s eyes.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that the heavens want us dead.&rdquo;<br>Overwhelmed by the feeling of powerlessness, some people began to despair.<br>They all felt that they would die here.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, special bodies of light shot out from the central region of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain.<br>Those were light spheroids. Every single one of them was only the size of an egg. Like rain, they flew over from all around.<br>Once the balls of light appeared, screams and weeping noises began to sound.<br>The crowd were surprised to discover that those balls of light were accurately aimed at every single person present.<br>Every single one of those balls of light was aimed at a single person.<br>The crowd all felt that they would be killed by the incoming balls of light.<br>The reason for that was because they were unable to stop the balls of light regardless of what sort of ability they used.<br>Finally, those bodies of light appeared before the crowd.<br>But, what the crowd was worried about didn&rsquo;t occur.<br>After those bodies of light arrived before the crowd, they all stopped. None of them caused any harm to the crowd.<br>Seeing the light spheroids before them, the crowd were all puzzled.<br>They didn't understand what was happening.<br>Right when the crowd were feeling most confused, the ancient voice sounded again.<br>&ldquo;It is now time for you all to decide your fate.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The light before you is the opportunity for you to choose your fate.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Cast your consciousness into it, and you will be able to make your choice,&rdquo; said the ancient voice.<br>&ldquo;What sort of choice do you want us to make?&rdquo; asked Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>His question was actually what the crowd all wanted to know too.<br>&ldquo;Choose two people,&rdquo; said the ancient voice.<br>&ldquo;Choose two people? To do what?&rdquo; asked the crowd.<br>&ldquo;Choose two people of the younger generation that you believe will be able to solve these chess boards.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The two of them will represent all of you. They will be in charge of breaching those spirit formations.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If one of them is able to breach a spirit formation, all of you will be able to escape alive.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, if neither of them are able to breach the spirit formations, all of you will die here,&rdquo; said the ancient voice.<br>&lsquo;Choose two people of the younger generation?&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;Only people of the younger generation?&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;Why two?&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;Must we hand our lives over to someone else?&rsquo;<br>The crowd&rsquo;s hearts were filled with misgivings and confusion.<br>However, they didn't bother to linger on those thoughts. Instead, they quickly cast their consciousnesses into the balls of light before them.<br>They began making their choices.<br>At practically the same time, light began to shine around Chu Feng.<br>Without any prior indication, without any warning, the light shone from Chu Feng and covered him like armor.<br>Besides Chu Feng, light also appeared on two other people.<br>They were Yu Ting and Lu Jie.<br>But, neither Yu Ting nor Lu Jie were emitting light as intensely as Chu Feng. In fact, Yu Ting&rsquo;s light was even dimmer than Lu Jie&rsquo;s.<br>The crowd had all immediately made their choices.<br>Tasked with choosing two people from the younger generations, Chu Feng became their first choice.<br>As for Lu Jie, although he had been defeated by Chu Feng, the reputation that he had accumulated over so many years was enough for him to gain the crowd&rsquo;s confidence.<br>Whilst there were also people that placed their hopes onto Yu Ting, the numbers were quite small.<br>In the end, the two people that had been tasked to carry the fate of the crowd ended up being Chu Feng and Lu Jie.<br>The ancient voice was heard again, &ldquo;The contents of the two chessboards are the same. The two of you are to enter either one.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is time for you two to put on a performance.&rdquo;<br>After the voice spoke, both Chu Feng and Lu Jie were surprised to discover that they were actually able to move again.<br>Not only were they able to move, they&rsquo;d also regained their strength.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, all our lives are in your hands. Please don&rsquo;t disappoint us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, make sure to be cautious. Do not be careless.&rdquo;<br>The crowd&rsquo;s voices sounded nonstop. Although they had chosen Chu Feng and Lu Jie, it was clear that they had more hopes for Chu Feng.<br>Lu Jie&rsquo;s expression turned ugly at this sight. Anger surged in his heart.<br>He knew very well that, in less than a day, his title as the Holy Light Galaxy&rsquo;s strongest world spiritist of the younger generation had been snatched away by Chu Feng.<br>&lsquo;I will have you all realize exactly who is the true genius.&rsquo;<br>With this thought in his mind, Lu Jie soared into the sky.<br>He did not directly enter the spirit formation. Instead, he began examining the chessboard from above.<br>Lu Jie was currently filled with fighting spirit.<br>The truth was, he didn&rsquo;t care about the life and death of the others at all.<br>But, he cared about the outcome of the match.<br>That&rsquo;s right. It was a match to him.<br>Although the match was unexpected, Lu Jie felt that it would be a great opportunity to prove himself.<br>After all, the lives of everyone present depended on him.<br>If he was able to keep them alive, it would be equivalent to him becoming their benefactor, their savior.<br>At that time, who would dare question his talent?<br>Because of that, Lu Jie felt that it was a match that he could only win, and not lose!<br></p></div>
