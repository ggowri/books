        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>&ldquo;Milord, is Chu Feng stronger than you?&rdquo; the other Blood-eyed Qilin Clansmen asked.</span><br><span>They were too weak to discern Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation, but they could tell how ridiculous his speed was from how he suddenly vanished into thin air.</span><br><span>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s most likely a rank nine Half-God level cultivator,&rdquo; Qi Weidao said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;How is that fellow so terrifying? Are we not going to avenge Lord Qi Luo and the others?&rdquo; The Blood-eyed Qilin Clansmen were reluctant to let things rest just like that.</span><br><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way we can let things rest just like that. We&rsquo;ll make them pay the price. </span><span>However, we can only exact vengeance if we have the strength for it. How else are we going to avenge them otherwise? By staking my life on the line? Or staking your lives on the line?&rdquo; Qi Weidao asked.</span><br><span>The person who had spoken earlier lowered his head in shame.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What should we do now?&rdquo; a Blood-eyed Qilin Clansman asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll continue working on the formations, but avoid the Totem Dragon Clansmen for the time being,&rdquo; Qi Weidao said before leading his clansmen off.</span><br><span>In truth, Chu Feng hadn&rsquo;t gone too far away. He wasn&rsquo;t too worried about getting discovered even though Qi Weidao&rsquo;s cultivation was higher than his due to Divine Concealment. He wanted to see how Qi Weidao would deal with this situation.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hahaha! Chu Feng, you sure are amazing. That fellow thinks that you&rsquo;re stronger than him!&rdquo; Eggy burst into laughter, thinking that the situation was hilarious.</span><br><span>Chu Feng, despite being weaker than Qi Weidao, managed to intimidate the latter through a series of maneuvers. Eggy found that more interesting than him directly crushing the other party.</span><br><span>In contrast, Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t as happy about it.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Eggy, I don&rsquo;t think that Qi Weidao is an easy person to deal with. He might have intentionally said those words for my ears. In any case, let&rsquo;s follow our original plan and avoid them as far as possible,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I concur. That fellow has a scheming face. He&rsquo;s bound to be much smarter than that ugly thing. It&rsquo;d be wise to tread carefully,&rdquo; Eggy said.</span><br><span>Chu Feng made his way toward the place he had told Long Chengyu and the others to head to. By the time he arrived, all of the Totem Dragon Clansmen were already gathered there.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, we&rsquo;re thankful to you.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Long Shanshan, Long Fulai, and the others walked up and bowed to Chu Feng. They had already heard about what had happened earlier on. If not for Chu Feng&rsquo;s timely intervention, Long Chengyu and Long Muxi might have died at the hands of the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan.</span><br><span>Chu Feng could be said to have rescued the future of their Totem Dragon Clan.</span><br><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for this. There&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;d leave Brother Chengyu and Miss Muxi to the lurch given my ties with them. Rather than dealing with such formalities, I&rsquo;d rather we have a hearty drink once we get out of here instead,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Right, let&rsquo;s have a hearty drink once we get out of here!&rdquo; Long Chengyu agreed.</span><br><span>Long Muxi stepped forward and seriously asked, &ldquo;Chu Feng, did they head there?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The surroundings immediately quietened down, for the others knew that Long Muxi was asking about the Blood-eyed Qilin Clansmen.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, Qi Weidao came over. He&rsquo;s indeed an exceptional individual. His strength is on par with that hideous fellow, and he&rsquo;s in possession of a God Armament too. I constructed a formation to bait him into making a move, but I suspect that his powers are even above that of the hideous fellow even without absorbing his clansmen&rsquo;s energy,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That fellow is that powerful?&rdquo; Long Chengyu was taken aback.</span><br><span>In truth, he had the upper hand in the fight against the rank five Half-God level </span><span>Blood-eyed Qilin Clansman, but the latter didn&rsquo;t hesitate to sacrifice his clansmen to empower himself, and that eventually led to Long Chengyu&rsquo;s defeat. If Qi Weidao was as powerful as Chu Feng said, Long Chengyu wouldn&rsquo;t be a match for him even at his peak, let alone in his current injured state.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t that mean that the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan has a prodigy on par with Xianhai Shaoyu?&rdquo; Long Chengyu frowned.</span><br><span>It was bad news to the Totem Dragon Clan that such a prodigy had appeared in the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan, considering the grudges between their clans.</span><br><span>&ldquo;However, I noticed a clear difference between Qi Weidao and that hideous monster after they raised their cultivation.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng proceeded to share the differences between the two of them after raising their cultivation.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan&rsquo;s guardian cultivation skill. The more powerful the cultivator is, the more humanoid their form would be when exerting the strength of their bloodline power. That was the cultivation skill the founder of the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan mastered that allowed him to stand to toe against our founder. Who could have thought that Qi Weidao practices the same cultivation skill?&rdquo; Long Chengyu said with a frown.</span><br><span>The signs were showing that Qi Weidao was a terrifying existence.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Brother Chengyu, do you not know who&rsquo;s the one who made the request with the Totem Dragon Clan?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>He vaguely sensed that Long Chengyu knew something, or else he wouldn&rsquo;t have reacted so strongly upon seeing the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan, even asking his big sister to return and report this matter to his father,</span><br><span>&ldquo;The rest of you leave first.&rdquo; Long Chengyu glanced at Long Yuhong and the others, except for Chu Feng and Long Muxi.</span><br><span>Knowing that Long Chengyu was going to talk about confidential matters, Long Yuhong and the others quickly took their leave. With that, the only ones left in the vicinity were Long Chengyu, Chu Feng, and Long Muxi.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master,&rdquo; Long Chengyu replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master?&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart skipped a beat.</span><br><span>He had heard of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master. His name was Jie Tianran, whereas his wife was named Jie Nianqing. The two of them had an incomparably talented daughter. Jie Tianran named her after the final syllable of his and his wife&rsquo;s name: Jie Ranqing.</span><br><span>And Jie Ranqing was none other than Chu Feng&rsquo;s mother, meaning that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master was his maternal grandfather.</span></p></div>
