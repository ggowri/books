        <div>: Little Women<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;You have a companion with you? The two of you are the most beautiful Asura World Spirits I have ever seen, but you sure talk big.&rdquo;<br>The woman from the Fairy Spirit World glanced at Eggy and Xue Ji. She subconsciously thought that their relationship was similar to that between her and Daoist Ninth Dragon&rsquo;s world spirit. Their masters might be allied with each other, thus forming the foundation of their partnership too.<br>She knew that the two of them couldn&rsquo;t have been serving under the same world spiritist as each world spiritist could only send a single world spirit in here.<br>In fact, of the army of world spirits with her earlier, the only one whom she was acquainted with was Daoist Ninth Dragon&rsquo;s Demon World Spirit. As for the other world spirits, she had simply encountered them along the way and dominated them.<br>&ldquo;Are you talking about this little girl? We aren&rsquo;t on the same side,&rdquo; Xue Ji immediately refuted her relationship with Eggy with a wintry face.<br>&ldquo;That little girl looks like she wants to help you though,&rdquo; the woman remarked.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need her help,&rdquo; Xue Ji replied sharply.<br>She began making her move once more, but for some reason, her fighting prowess appeared to have gone up by a little.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>However, the woman from the Fairy Spirit World scoffed at her attempt.<br>Shoosh shoosh!<br>Pah pah!<br>She began flicking her wrist, causing her whip to produce deafening sonic booms that quaked the entire hall. These sonic booms came one after another, and they exploded on contact, making them incredibly difficult to deal with.<br>Faced with such an attack, Xue Ji could only flee in a fluster. It was difficult, but she was able to evade most of the sonic boom. That being said, she wouldn&rsquo;t last too long against the stream of attacks if she could only take evasive maneuvers.<br>&ldquo;Stop being so obstinate and beg this Queen for help. Who knows? I might just take pity on you and deal with her on your behalf.&rdquo;<br>Eggy leisurely shouted to Xue Ji by the side as if she was nothing more than a spectator. She even started laughing at some point in time, though her sweet laughter hardly sounded jarring at all despite its mocking nature.<br>It couldn&rsquo;t be helped given how adorable she was. Her smile was enchanting regardless of her mood.<br>Xue Ji gritted her teeth and persisted.<br>Boom!<br>One of the sonic booms flew in the direction where Xue Ji was heading to and landed in advance. She managed to dodge it in the nick of time, but she wasn&rsquo;t able to avoid getting caught by the shockwave of its explosion.<br>Any normal cultivator in her position would have been knocked out by the shockwave, but through her adept maneuvers, Xue Ji was able to avoid slamming into the wall and even gracefully landed on the floor. It was just that the shockwave&rsquo;s force caused her to skid for a long distance across the hall, leaving behind a long trail of blood.<br>Xue Ji had also sustained significant internal injuries, causing her to spew blood.<br>&ldquo;Are you still going to keep on the tough act? I never knew that you&rsquo;re so stubborn. Haven&rsquo;t you heard of the adage that a man should know when to adapt to his tides?&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a man anyway,&rdquo; Xue Ji replied.<br>&ldquo;Then what are you?&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re asking the obvious,&rdquo; Xue Ji replied.<br>&ldquo;I guess that you&rsquo;re a little woman then. It&rsquo;s no wonder they say that there&rsquo;s nothing more difficult to deal with in this world other than despicable men and little women,&rdquo; Eggy replied.<br>&ldquo;What the hell are you prattling on about? Aren&rsquo;t you a woman too?&rdquo;<br>The woman from the Fairy Spirit World couldn&rsquo;t stand listening to Eggy&rsquo;s nonsense anymore. For some reason, she felt insulted by Eggy&rsquo;s words too because she was a woman too.<br>&ldquo;This Queen is different from the rest of you. You&rsquo;re all little women, but I&rsquo;m a noble queen,&rdquo; Eggy replied.<br>&ldquo;Look who&rsquo;s calling other little,&rdquo; Xue Ji scoffed as she glanced at Eggy&rsquo;s chest.<br>Eggy reacted by puffing out her chest.<br>&ldquo;I might be small, but I&rsquo;m still big where it counts,&rdquo; Eggy replied proudly.<br>She wasn&rsquo;t wrong.<br>&ldquo;Lass, who are you trying to show off to? There aren&rsquo;t any men here. Besides, you&rsquo;re speaking as if the rest of us don&rsquo;t have anything to show.&rdquo;<br>The woman from the Fairy Spirit World also puffed out her chest. While her looks weren&rsquo;t on par with Eggy and Xue Ji, her chests&hellip; weren&rsquo;t small either.<br>&ldquo;Are you certain that you aren&rsquo;t going to help her? I&rsquo;ll be killing her if that&rsquo;s the case.&rdquo;<br>Throughout her conversation with Eggy, the woman from the Fairy Spirit World didn&rsquo;t halt her attacks against Xue Ji. However, for some reason, her aggression had reduced by a fair bit. This gave the severely injured Xue Ji a chance to catch a breather.<br>&ldquo;Feel free to kill her. We&rsquo;ll have a showdown to decide the final victor afterward,&rdquo; Eggy replied.<br>&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo;<br>The woman from the Fairy Spirit World accepted the offer, but for some reason, her attacks remained sluggish compared to before. It was almost as if there were a pair of shackles tying her down.<br>Shoosh!<br>The woman from the Fairy Spirit World suddenly turned her whip toward Eggy and unleashed multiple golden dragons.This was an attack even stronger than the sonic booms.<br>Eggy&rsquo;s confident attitude suggested that she wasn&rsquo;t any weaker than Xue Ji, possibly because she had obtained external power from the earlier trial too. Sensing that Eggy was a threat, she secretly prepared a move in hopes of eliminating Eggy with an unexpected assault.<br>As long as she was able to get rid of Eggy, Xue Ji wouldn&rsquo;t pose a problem at all.<br>Boom!<br>The golden dragons traveled with incredible prowess at an amazing speed. It crashed right into the spot where Eggy was standing on, stirring up huge shockwaves.<br>Yet, the woman from the Fairy Spirit World frowned instead.<br>It turned out that Eggy had risen into the air, perfectly evading the attack.<br>&ldquo;She was guarded against me all this while?&rdquo; the woman muttered regretfully.<br>She realized that Eggy&rsquo;s attention hadn&rsquo;t wavered in the least even though she had been talking nonstop all this while. This meant that Eggy would be a far more troublesome opponent for her than she had initially thought.<br>Her earlier guess about Eggy&rsquo;s strength was also on the dot.<br>Golden light similar to the one around Xue Ji had shrouded Eggy&rsquo;s body, and her strength rose all the way to peak Half-God level.<br>However, what surprised the woman the most was still the fact Eggy had dodged her attack. She had put a lot of her energy into this attack in order to take down Eggy in a single move, such that the latter shouldn&rsquo;t have been able to dodge her attack so easily.<br>She did notice that Eggy had exerted a strong force for the briefest of moments when she dodged the attack, but it happened too quickly for her to discern what had exactly happened.<br>In any case, there was no doubt that Eggy was going to be much harder to deal with than Xue Ji.<br></p></div>
