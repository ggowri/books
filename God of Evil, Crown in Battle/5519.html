A hint of a smile could be seen hanging in his mouth. His arrogance provoked the nine-colored lightning, prompting it to intensify its attack, but none of its means worked on him. In the end, it had no choice but to fuse together with him.</span><br><span>When Chu Feng finally opened his eyes, there were still traces of lightning in the vicinity. Eggy saw the nine-colored lightning&rsquo;s remnants and immediately understood what had happened.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, did you make a breakthrough for both your spirit power and your martial cultivation?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the fortuitous encounter I received from the compass. I&rsquo;m now a rank three Half-God level cultivator and a Gold Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Heavens! Is that compass that formidable? It&rsquo;s practically a cultivation treasure!&rdquo; Eggy was overjoyed to hear that.</span><br><span>It was one thing for the compass to contain martial enlightenment, but to think that it harnessed the impetus for a spirit power breakthrough too! This showed just how incredible the compass was.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s indeed something good, but I feel like there&rsquo;s something amiss about it,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he continued observing the compass.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with it?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not too sure either. Forget it. The compass will probably show its transformations again during the next break time, so I&rsquo;ll just figure it out then,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;d be great if you can grasp another impetus for a breakthrough when that time comes.&rdquo; Eggy rubbed her hands expectantly.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hahaha! That would be for the best!&rdquo; Chu Feng exclaimed.</span><br><span>He didn&rsquo;t think that it was likely, but that didn&rsquo;t hinder him from looking forward to it.</span><br><span>Now that he had finished making his breakthrough, he decided to resume his search for Long Chengyu. He knew that the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan wasn&rsquo;t an easy foe to deal with, so he wanted to meet up with Long Chengyuy and the others as soon as possible. It felt like something bad might happen otherwise.</span><br><span>Soon, Chu Feng arrived at a formation.</span><br><span>There were Totem Dragon Clansmen there, but Long Chengyu, Long Muxi, Long Yuhong, and Long Zhizhi were nowhere to be seen. These Totem Dragon Clansmen were busy infusing their auras into the formation.</span><br><span>For some reason, their overall strength was roughly equivalent to Long Shanshan and Long Fulai&rsquo;s group, but the speed at which they completed the formation was ten times faster.</span><br><span>Chu Feng noticed dragon avatars above their heads. These avatars emanated an aura similar to the formation here, which led him into thinking that it was related to why they were able to complete the formation so quickly.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s with that avatar above your heads?&rdquo; Chu Feng walked up to them and asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The Totem Dragon Clansmen had been so focused on completing the formation as soon as possible as it was one of the few uncontested ones that they didn&rsquo;t notice Chu Feng&rsquo;s arrival. It was only when Chu Feng spoke that they noticed his presence.</span><br><span>Some of the Totem Dragon Clansmen here were previously part of Long Yuhong&rsquo;s </span><span>and Long Zhizhi&rsquo;s groups, so they had witnessed how fast Chu Feng could complete the formation, as well as him shaking off Feng Jiuyue and Feng Tiansheng despite being at rank two Half-God level.</span><br><span>Even though they could complete the formation much faster now, they knew that they were still no match for Chu Feng. More than happy to let Chu Feng make the move, they willingly stepped out of the formation core.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s with the avatars too. They suddenly appeared over our heads after break time. We can&rsquo;t touch them at all,&rdquo; a Totem Dragon Clansman said as he waved his hands over the dragon avatar, proving that it was intangible. &ldquo;But ever since the avatar appeared, the speed at which we completed the formation greatly increased. It must have something to do with the formation here.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is it still as painful as before?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>He noticed that the Totem Dragon Clansmen were still hissing in pain even though they were much more efficient now.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s still painful,&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clansman replied. &ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, don&rsquo;t you feel any pain when you infuse your aura into the formation?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m good at enduring pain,&rdquo; Chu Feng randomly cooked up an excuse as he couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to explain the matter.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng is indeed extraordinary.&rdquo;</span><br><span>The Totem Dragon Clansmen unconditionally believed Chu Feng&rsquo;s words.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Let me do it,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>He stepped into the formation core and began releasing his red lightning aura.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Heaven above! Isn&rsquo;t young hero Chu Feng too formidable?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The Totem Dragon Clansmen gasped in shock, both men and women alike. Even those who had previously witnessed Chu Feng&rsquo;s means were stunned too. The gap between them was simply too huge!</span><br><span>It didn&rsquo;t take long for Chu Feng to complete the formation, and a light pillar crackling with red lightning surged into the sky. The formation was completed with great ease.</span><br><span>The Totem Dragon Clansmen stared at one another with dazed expressions. They seemed to be wondering why there was such a huge gap between them.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Long Zhizhi and Long Yuhong?&rdquo; Chu Feng walked out of the formation core and asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Miss Yuhong and Miss Zhizhi have gone to look for the young master and the others,&rdquo; a Totem Dragon Clansman replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You can head in and cultivate,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; The Totem Dragon Clansmen quickly headed into the formation core.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hm? Young hero Chu Feng, look!&rdquo;</span><br><span>The Totem Dragon Clansmen excitedly pointed at the avatar above their heads, which had become much clearer upon stepping into the formation core. Their ability to complete the formation had been further enhanced!</span></p></div>
