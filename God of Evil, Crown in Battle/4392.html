        <h1>Chapter 4391</h1>
        <div>: Father and Son<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once again, the attack from the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster was deflected. It was the doing of the Sagacious Grandmaster&rsquo;s barrier around the dueling ring once more.<br>However, the battle had already ended, thus concluding the tournament.<br>&ldquo;Sagacious Grandmaster, why are you helping him? This fellow is a scum of the cultivation world, he deserves to die! Why are you siding with such a person?&rdquo; the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster howled indignantly.<br>He was extremely furious at this very moment, such that he couldn&rsquo;t hold back his emotions and shouted at the Sagacious Grandmaster. Zhao Xuanhe was simply too important to him!<br>If not for the Sagacious Grandmaster protecting Chu Feng, he would have already killed that bastard, and Zhao Xuanhe wouldn&rsquo;t have died in the first place. As such, he felt that the Sagacious Grandmaster had a part to play in Zhao Xuanhe&rsquo;s death too.<br>It was just that the Sagacious Grandmaster was too powerful, such that he wasn&rsquo;t a match for the other party. So, he could only vent his frustration by shouting at the other party.<br>Nevertheless, he still didn&rsquo;t dare to say anything too ugly.<br>This was simply the helplessness of a person standing before an absolute rift in strength.<br>Before the Sagacious Grandmaster, no matter how despicable or vicious the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster was, there was nothing he could do at all.<br>&ldquo;Sagacious Grandmaster, why are you protecting a person like him?&rdquo;<br>Someone else echoed the words of the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster too. It was the Eight Immortal Swordswomen of the Dao Sea.<br>The rest of the crowd didn&rsquo;t dare to stand up against the Sagacious Grandmaster, but they still directed intrigue looks toward the latter, as if they were unable to understand the rationale behind his actions.<br>Based on what they knew about the Sagacious Grandmaster, the only times he used his spirit power was to uphold the rules of the tournament on the dueling ring. As for personal grudges and the sort, he couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to intervene at all.<br>So, the attitude he was putting on today was very unnatural.<br>Just what was so special about Chu Feng that he had made an exception to protect him?<br>&ldquo;Your disciple agreed to the bet prior to the duel. Since he has lost, shouldn&rsquo;t he fulfill the end of his promise?&rdquo; the Sagacious Grandmaster glanced at Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster and answered his doubt.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Regarding this matter, the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster had nothing to say. He couldn&rsquo;t argue about this since Zhao Xuanhe had agreed to it on his own volition.<br>So, he instead changed the topic and said, &ldquo;Sagacious Grandmaster, Xuanhe has already paid for my folly with his life, so the conflict between the two of them has already come to an end. Why are you still protecting Chu Feng then? Am I to simply let this fellow off after he has killed my disciples and stolen my treasure&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You can settle the score, but not in my territory. He came to participate in the tournament I organized, so I am responsible for his safety. I can&rsquo;t allow you to touch him here.<br>&ldquo;Go out.&rdquo;<br>The Sagacious Grandmaster waved his sleeves lightly.<br>Fwoosh!<br>A mystical power enveloped everyone present, and for a moment, it felt like the entire ancient castle was shaking lightly.<br>Before most people could even understand what was going on, they suddenly found themselves standing outside the ancient castle.<br>The Sagacious Grandmaster had teleported them out of the ancient castle.<br>The crowd from the Soaring Flower Gazebo, the Eight Immortal Swordswomen of the Dao Sea, Liu Shangwu, and everyone else, including the Sagacious Grandmaster&rsquo;s servant, Ordinary, were all teleported out of the ancient castle.<br>Doing a quick head count, except for Chu Feng and the Sagacious Grandmaster, it appeared that everyone had been teleported out.<br>&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Facing such a sight, everyone was feeling deeply bewildered and intrigued.<br>There were even some who directed looks of pity toward the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>Everything that had happened thus far was more than enough to display the Sagacious Grandmaster&rsquo;s intention to side with Chu Feng on this matter.<br>And if the Sagacious Grandmaster had chosen to protect Chu Feng, the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster wouldn&rsquo;t stand a chance at all.<br>&ldquo;Elder Ordinary, is the Sagacious Grandmaster acquainted with Chu Feng?&rdquo; a person amongst the Eight Immortal Swordswomen of the Dao Sea asked.<br>They were simply too curious about this matter.<br>And as it would have it, every single person who was in the ancient castle earlier shared the same emotions too.<br>This was the first time they were seeing the Sagacious Grandmaster siding with someone so blatantly. This made them realize that the young man named Chu Feng might have a peculiar relationship with the Sagacious Grandmaster.<br>&ldquo;He has never met Chu Feng before,&rdquo; Ordinary replied.<br>&ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t know one another, why did the Sagacious Grandmaster protect him then?&rdquo; the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster exclaimed with a howl.<br>Had it been on normal occasions, he would have never dared lashed out at Ordinary like that.<br>As the saying went, before beating a dog, look at its master first. Not to mention, Ordinary had been serving the Sagacious Grandmaster for many years, and he possessed great strength too.<br>However, the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster was too furious to care that much about it anymore. His teeth were gnashed together, veins were popping from his temple, and even his eyes had turned blood-red. It was almost as if he was going to murder someone.<br>This was the first time the crowd had seen such a side to the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster. They could vividly feel his rage.<br>However, they could empathize with him too.<br>Zhao Xuanhe was his beloved disciple, and just a moment ago, the other party was killed right before his eyes. How could he not be enraged over this?<br>&ldquo;Sectmaster Xu, I know that he&rsquo;s your beloved son, but you have failed to bring him up well. You turned a blind eye to him when he harmed Liu Shangwu, and you didn&rsquo;t pay any heed when he recklessly put his life on the line for a duel. Since that&rsquo;s the case, you should have already resolved yourself for the possibility that he might have lost and been killed as a result of that.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that you&rsquo;re in a position to blame the Grandmaster for this. Your son isn&rsquo;t innocent either.&rdquo;<br>The amicable smile on Ordinary&rsquo;s face vanished as he spoke. Clearly, the words of the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster displeased him.<br>&ldquo;What? Son?&rdquo;<br>And as soon as Ordinary said those words, it immediately stirred up a huge commotion in the area.<br>That word in itself was more than enough to explain why the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster was completely agitated at the moment.<br>In truth, there were already rumors regarding this matter. There had been word going around that the reason why the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster doted on Zhao Xuanhe so much was because the latter was his son.<br>However, the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster had never admitted it, so the rumors remained unverified all these years.<br>But what kind of person was Ordinary?<br>He might be the servant of the Sagacious Grandmaster, but one would have to be a fool to underestimate his abilities. His strength in itself was more than enough to qualify him as one of the powerhouses of the Nine Soul Galaxy.<br>Someone of his standing wouldn&rsquo;t stoop to the level of spouting lies.<br>Since Ordinary had already put it like that, there was a good chance that what he had said was indeed the truth.<br>Hearing those words, the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster broke out crying, &ldquo;Xuanhe, I have let you down. I failed to protect you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>His wails were so sorrowful that it caught the attention of many people within the city.<br>On top of that, he didn&rsquo;t deny what Ordinary said. In a sense, that could be considered as an acknowledgment of what Ordinary said about his relationship with Zhao Xuanhe, affirming that they were father and son.<br>It was in this instant that everyone was able to understand why the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster was in such great grief. It turned out that what he lost wasn&rsquo;t just his beloved disciple but his only son too.<br>The Eight Immortal Swordswomen of the Dao Sea even stepped forward to console him. After all, their organizations were on close terms with one another.<br></p></div>
