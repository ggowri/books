        <div>: Fortuitous Encounter<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As jarring as the Divine Deer&rsquo;s words were, Chu Feng thought that they made perfect sense.<br>The Divine Deer was in no way obliged to help him. He could ask others to help him save Xian Miaomiao, but he had no right to blame the other party if they refused to help.<br>&ldquo;Thank you for your help today, elder,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>He then turned his gaze toward Shengguang Buyu and the others. They had been looking at Chu Feng all this while with complicated looks in their eyes. They knew that it was thanks to Chu Feng that they were able to escape from Master Yin Ren&rsquo;s grasp earlier on.<br>It was with an absurdly fast speed that they had escaped from the territory of the Zhuge Clan. Once again, Chu Feng had completely surpassed their imagination.<br>This left them curious as to what kind of means Chu Feng had used to allow him to easily escape from someone as powerful as Master Yin Ren.<br>No, it wouldn&rsquo;t even be appropriate to call it an escape. With such speed, Chu Feng could head wherever he wanted without impediment. Master Yin Ren wouldn&rsquo;t be able to contain him at all.<br>They had only chosen to keep their silence because they noticed the grim look on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face. They were waiting for the latter to explain to them on his own.<br>&ldquo;Elders, I shan&rsquo;t hide the truth from you. I managed to obtain great power during a fortuitous encounter. I&rsquo;m not too sure about the origin of the power, and to this date, I haven&rsquo;t been able to fully comprehend its nature either. This power has saved me several times when I&rsquo;m in a desperate situation, but it&rsquo;s not under my control yet.<br>&ldquo;Take the earlier situation for example, we were only able to escape due to the power it has bequeathed to me. If I had control over the power, I would have surely taken Princess Xiaoxiao away with me. That&rsquo;s also the reason why I couldn&rsquo;t escape from Elder Baimei back then at the Holy Light Clan too.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible for me to escape using this power, but it&rsquo;s conditional on whether the power is willing to help me or not,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>He didn&rsquo;t think that there was any need for him to hide the truth from them, especially since they had braved through life and death together.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng is indeed a person with great luck. You need not get so disappointed. That power of yours must have originated from an extraordinary background. You must have won it over with your talent, and I believe that it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before you put it under your control,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei complimented Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng smiled in response to the compliment, but it was a strained smile.<br>He knew that he had managed to catch the eye of the Divine Deer with his talent, but he felt utterly helpless as he was unable to freely use this power. It felt so frustrating how he couldn&rsquo;t do anything to Master Yin Ren.<br>It reminded him of how he had only managed to survive in the Holy Valley due to the presence of a mysterious expert guarding him, whom he guessed to be the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>It felt like he had always been relying on others, and his own weakness frustrated him.<br>There was no doubt that he had been swiftly growing thus far, and he had defeated countless enemies who stood in his way. Yet, it felt like there was always a stronger opponent in front of him.<br>The only way for him to turn things around was to reach the very top of the world of cultivation, or else the same situation would only continue to happen.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, I can tell that you care a lot for Princess Miaomiao. In view of your relationship with her, our Holy Valley will do our best to help you. That old bastard Yin Ren is not a pushover, but he&rsquo;s not much of a threat either. Even the Nine Souls Sacred Clan doesn&rsquo;t pose a threat to us. Once our Holy Monarch emerges from his closed-door training, we&rsquo;ll be able to redress your grievances.<br>&ldquo;For the time being, I don&rsquo;t think Princess Xiaoxiao is in danger. Yin Ren clearly has some use for her, so she should be safe. You don&rsquo;t need to worry too much about it for now,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei said.<br>However, that did little to improve Chu Feng&rsquo;s mood.<br>Master Yin Ren emanated a sinister vibe. Given how he dared to even lay his hands on Princess Xiaoxiao and the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, it was likely that he was hatching a huge scheme.<br>Chu Feng had no idea what that scheme was, but if one thing was for sure, Master Yin Ren was an extremely dangerous individual. It was impossible for him not to be worried when Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s life was in the hands of someone like that.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I&rsquo;ve already talked things over with Lord Baimei. I&rsquo;ll return to the Holy Valley first. Once our Holy Monarch comes out of his closed-door training, I&rsquo;ll report the matter to him,&rdquo; Shengguang Buyu said.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, elders,&rdquo; Chu Feng clasped his fist and earnestly thanked them.<br>Master Yin Ren was a difficult opponent to deal with, not just because of his strength but his cunningness too. Most people wouldn&rsquo;t be willing to make an enemy out of such a person.<br>Not to mention, the Nine Souls Sacred Clan was the overlord of the Nine Souls Galaxy, and they had suppressed the Holy Light Clan for many years now.<br>Yet, the two elders of the Holy Valley were willing to make an enemy out of Master Yin Ren and the Nine Souls Sacred Clan for his sake, and it appeared that they weren&rsquo;t just words. How could Chu Feng not feel touched by their sentiments?<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re being too distant. We wouldn&rsquo;t have survived the earlier ordeal if not for you. If anything, we owe you our lives,&rdquo; Shengguang Buyu said.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, I view you as one of our own. This isn&rsquo;t just your private affair anymore. This is a grudge between our Holy Light Galaxy and Nine Souls Galaxy. Even if not for you, our Holy Valley wouldn&rsquo;t have tolerated the arrogance of the Nine Souls Galaxy for much longer,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei said.<br>&ldquo;Elder, I shan&rsquo;t bother with pleasantries since that&rsquo;s the case. However, I&rsquo;d like you to know that I, Chu Feng, am not an ingrate. I won&rsquo;t let you down,&rdquo; Chu Feng said solemnly.<br>Then, he added, &ldquo;Are we heading back now?&rdquo;<br>Given a choice, Chu Feng would rather rely on himself. However, he was too worried about Xian Miaomiao and wanted to save her as soon as possible. If the Holy Valley was willing to lend him a helping hand, he was more than happy to accept their help.<br>&ldquo;Of course not. I&rsquo;ll be returning to the Holy Light Galaxy alone. You, Lord Baimei, and Brother Niantian have another place where you have to be.&rdquo;<br>A mysterious smile emerged on Shengguang Buyu&rsquo;s lips.<br>&ldquo;Another place where I have to be?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was confused.<br>He quickly noticed Shengguang Baimei and Daoist Niantian were looking at him with the same cryptic smile too, especially for Daoist Niantian. It looked as if they had a huge surprise prepared for him.<br></p></div>
