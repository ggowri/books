        <h1>Chapter 4151</h1>
        <div> - Ruthless Character<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Grandmaster Liangqiu&hellip;&rdquo;<br>With an apologetic look, Long Daozhi arrived before Grandmaster Liangqiu. He wanted to say something. But, after he arrived before Grandmaster Liangqiu, he started to hesitate and was unable to speak.<br>As the entrance had a restriction of ten people per entrance, it would close after the tenth person entered, the five powers had arranged beforehand that each power could only bring in two people.<br>Long Daozhi was most definitely going to enter. As for the other person, they would need to be a powerful helper.<br>If Chu Feng hadn&rsquo;t been there then Grandmaster Liangqiu would naturally be the most optimal candidate. But since Chu Feng was present, he would have no choice but to step aside.<br>This was the reason why Long Daozhi had such a look of guilt on his face.<br>&ldquo;City Master Long, this old man understands.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to say anything. I don&rsquo;t blame you. After all, I came here with the hope of being able to help you. My wish is for your success.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, this old man has a request. The Endless Abyss is filled with danger. City Master Long, you must properly protect young friend Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Whilst the Endless Abyss&rsquo;s Dragon Vein Source Stone is the hope of your Ancestral Martial Dragon City, Chu Feng is the hope of our Ancestral Martial Starfield.&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Liangqiu was extremely sincere and earnest as he said those words.<br>He even took a deliberate glance at Chu Feng as he spoke.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng's heart was flooded with emotions.<br>To be acknowledged in such a manner by a senior of his was also an act of honor for him.<br>After all, Grandmaster Liangqiu used to be a tall mountain to Chu Feng in the past.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, please rest assured. I will definitely ensure young friend Chu Feng&rsquo;s safety.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if something is to happen to me, I would not allow anything to happen to him,&rdquo; Long Daozhi guaranteed.<br>Then, he looked at the four other alliance powers&rsquo; leaders, &ldquo;Everyone, my Ancestral Martial Dragon City will proceed ahead of you all. Let us meet inside.&rdquo;<br>Long Daozhi then brought Chu Feng along with him and flew into the entrance of the Endless Abyss.<br>The four other leaders were not in a rush to enter. Instead, they looked at the four world spiritists that were still screaming in pain.<br>&ldquo;Stop screaming. We weren&rsquo;t ruthless in our attacks. Those are nothing more than superficial wounds. Was there really a need to scream like that?&rdquo;<br>Not only were their tones very stern, but annoyance also filled their faces.<br>They had really taught the four world spiritists a lesson.<br>After all, they had been very dissatisfied with their performance.<br>If they could, they would&rsquo;ve directly killed them.<br>After all, they'd only managed to activate the keys using their own lifespan and bloodline powers.<br>But if it wasn&rsquo;t for Chu Feng&rsquo;s appearance, the four world spiritists would&rsquo;ve wasted their opportunity to enter the spirit formation entrance, and all that they&rsquo;d paid to obtain such an opportunity.<br>Because of that, they had already been extremely angry with the four world spiritists.<br>It was simply that they had no other choice as they still needed aid from the four world spiritists.<br>No matter how strong Chu Feng might be, he was still Long Daozhi's helper. He couldn&rsquo;t possibly help them instead of him.<br>Because of that, they had held back when they attacked the four world spiritists earlier.<br>&ldquo;An extraordinary humiliation. Truly an extraordinary humiliation.&rdquo;<br>At that moment the four world spiritists all stood up in succession.<br>Merely by touching their mouths, they were able to completely recover from their injuries. Their severed tongues were restored, and even the blood on their faces was wiped clean.<br>Sure enough, their earlier screams had been nothing more than an act. What they had suffered were nothing more than superficial wounds that they could easily recover from.<br>However, looks of grievance still filled their faces.<br>They had not anticipated that the four leaders would, for the sake of entering the Endless Abyss, attack them.<br>However, after they had been attacked, they had no choice but to tolerate it. After all, there was nothing else they could do.<br>In the end, they were still afraid of those four leaders.<br>&ldquo;The four of you failed to breach the spirit formation, yet it was breached by a single brat. That is indeed an extraordinary humiliation for you four.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that we still need the four of you you would be four corpses right now,&rdquo; said the four leaders fiercely.<br>The four leaders had revealed their true colors by saying those words.<br>They did not care about the life and deaths of the four world spiritists.<br>The reason why they hadn&rsquo;t killed them was because they still needed them.<br>Hearing those words, the four world spiritists did not dare utter any words of refute. They were so scared that they started shivering.<br>They knew very well that their lives were now in the hands of those four leaders.<br>Since the four leaders had decided to have a falling-out with them, they simply did not dare resist then at all. If they resisted, they would only be courting death.<br>&ldquo;That said, we are not people that lack feelings and sentiments. We will now give the four of you an opportunity to make up for your earlier failure. Follow us into the Endless Abyss.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The four of you best make sure to be of use inside the Endless Abyss.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you do not properly cherish this opportunity we will definitely take your lives.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, the four leaders grabbed the four world spiritists and entered the Endless Abyss.<br>This spectacle had been fully observed by Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>Seeing the four world spiritists that had joined hands to bully and humiliate him being berated in such a manner, afraid to even utter a single word in response, he felt truly delighted; truly refreshed.<br>However, he also came to understand the true nature of the four leaders.<br>They were all vicious and merciless. They were all ruthless characters that would act unscrupulously to obtain their goals.<br>It was not a good thing for Long Daozhi to join hands with them.<br>However, Grandmaster Liangqiu was not worried.<br>He was aware of Long Daozhi and Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength and character.<br>Even though the four leaders were all ruthless characters, and those four world spiritists were all treacherous fellows, he knew that Chu Feng and Long Daozhi were not fish on the chopping block.<br>Even though Chu Feng and Long Daozhi treated their friends with sincerity, they were more ruthless than tigers and wolves towards their enemies.<br>Even amongst ruthless characters, they would be considered ruthless.<br></p></div>
