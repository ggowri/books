        <h1>Chapter 697</h1>
        <div> - Shocking Everyone<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>No one on the Misty Peak knew of the things Chu Feng experienced within the Martial Marking Immortal Realm. All of them believed Chu Feng had already died.<br>Though Chu Feng&rsquo;s death made a few people grieved, a large portion of the people were not concerned with the matter because another gate of the Martial Marking Immortal Realm had opened&mdash;the entrance to exchange Martial Markings for martial skills.<br>At that very instant, many people had already entered in a stream to exchange their marks for martial skills. When a person entered, a number would appear on the entrance's Spirit Formation gate. The number represented the amount of Martial Markings the person obtained. As for what sort of martial skill was obtained, this would not appear.<br>&ldquo;Waa, seventy Martial Markings! As expected of Murong Xun&rsquo;s younger sister. Truly, &lsquo;like brother, like sister&rsquo;.&rdquo; After Murong Wan entered, the number &ldquo;seventy&rdquo; appeared. No matter male, female, old, or young, all of the people on top of the peak let out exclamations.<br>In comparison to the number of Martial Markings from others, seventy Martial Markings was definitely an impressive number. Although to Zhan Feng&rsquo;s ninety Martial Markings from before, it was quite a bit inferior, it was extremely exceptional to the people on the peak.<br>&ldquo;Lady Murong, not bad! You&rsquo;ve actually gotten seventy Martial Markings! Quite a bountiful harvest, huh? You should have obtained quite a decent rank nine martial skill, right?&rdquo; After Murong Wan walked out of the Martial Marking Immortal Realm, Zhan Feng smugly smiled.<br>&ldquo;Zhan Feng, don&rsquo;t be so complacent. If you didn&rsquo;t take all of your subordinates&rsquo; portion, could you capture ninety Martial Markings? Can you capture so many alone?<br>&ldquo;Back then, my second brother did not rely on anybody, nor did he pocket away his companions&rsquo; portion. He relied on himself to capture a hundred twenty Martial Markings. In comparison to him, you are very far away,&rdquo; Murong Wan said in a very derisive manner.<br>Zhan Feng&rsquo;s complexion was very unsightly upon hearing those words, because as Murong Wan said, the reason he had his achievement of ninety Martial Markings was because he did not equally divide Martial Markings with his subordinates, and indeed monopolized a large portion for himself. Otherwise, it&rsquo;d be impossible for him to have such a number.<br>&ldquo;So what? The winners are declared kings and the losers are made thieves. The one in first place in this Martial Marking Immortal Realm is me, not you.&rdquo; Seeing his actions exposed, Zhan Feng denied nothing and just bluntly admitted it. Since he was also a peak genius of the Immortal Execution Archipelago, from the bottom of his heart, he did not fear Murong Wan.<br>&ldquo;Hmph. Shameless person.&rdquo; Murong Wan coldly snorted and paid attention to him no longer. Although they were both from the Immortal Execution Archipelago, she had always felt disgusted at Zhan Feng&rsquo;s style of doing certain things. Although she had also taken away her subordinates&rsquo; Martial Markings, she definitely would not have been as excessive as Zhan Feng.<br>&ldquo;Look! It&rsquo;s ninety-eight markings! It would have reached a hundred Martial Markings with just a tiny bit more!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Impressive, truly impressive! With just two more she could have exchanged the markings for a Mortal Taboo martial skill!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ya Fei is indeed Ya Fei. No wonder she&rsquo;s called the strongest genius in the Immortal Execution Archipelago with the exception of Murong Xun. Looking at her today, the rumours were indeed true.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It looks like first place in this event will belong to none other than her!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, bursts of yells rang out from the crowds; Ya Fei was actually able to capture ninety-eight Martial Markings.<br>&ldquo;Haha, who just said he was first?&rdquo; Seeing that, Murong Wan laughed loudly. Although she did not like Ya Fei that much, since she was her second brother&rsquo;s fianc&eacute;e, she did not dislike her as much as Zhan Feng. So, if she had the choice, she would rather Ya Fei be first rather than Zhan Feng.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo; At that instant, Zhan Feng&rsquo;s face became ashen. He had just finished boasting, yet now, he was surpassed by Ya Fei. It was tantamount to being slapped before the crowd, making him embarrassed in public.<br>Afterwards, the others entered the Martial Marking Immortal Realm in succession. Apart from the three peak geniuses from the Immortal Execution Archipelago, Xia Yu, Qiu Zhu, and Dong Xue had obtained quite some achievements.<br>Xia Yu and Dong Xue both captured thirty-five Martial Markings. Although this was not something that could be compared on the same level as Ya Fei and the others, it was relatively decent.<br>As for Qiu Zhu, she had captured seventy Martial Markings. The reason she had more than Xia Yu and Dong Xue was because both of them, in order so she wouldn&rsquo;t lose to Ya Fei, intentionally gave more to Qiu Zhu. In reality, when the three of them captured Martial Markings together, Qiu Zhu was the one who put more effort. She laboured more so thus she obtained more, so it was reasonable.<br>But actually, the reason why Qiu Zhu had the achievement of obtaining seventy Martial Marking was more so because she collected quite a few within the Temple of Reproduction. However, even so, there was still a very large distance between her and Ya Fei.<br>After all, Xia Yu and Dong Xue weren&rsquo;t as<br>selfless<br>as Ya Fei&rsquo;s subordinates, who gave their portion of Martial Markings all to Qiu Zhu.<br>&ldquo;Junior Chun Wu, people cannot revive after death. I feel very sorrowful at Junior Wuqing&rsquo;s death, but you must be stronger,&rdquo; Qiu Zhu advised Chun Wu after coming out of the Martial Marking Immortal Realm.<br>At that instant, actually, everyone&rsquo;s gazes were cast towards Chun Wu. After assuming Chu Feng had passed away, Chun Wu was very saddened. Tears constantly appeared streaming down on her face, and even her eyes swelled from the sobbing. This made her feel disinterest towards the most important section of the Martial Marking Immortal Realm.<br>At present, everyone who had entered the Martial Marking Immortal Realm to capture Martial Markings already exchanged martial skills belonging to themselves. Only Chun Wu herself had not entered yet.<br>&ldquo;Chun Wu, go ahead.&rdquo; Just at that moment, Lady Piaomiao spoke.<br>The heartbroken Chun Wu, though silent, took one step after the other into the Martial Marking Immortal Realm for exchanging martial skills.<br>&ldquo;Heavens! This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>In the instant Chun Wu stepped into that place, however, everyone&rsquo;s expression changed greatly. Even surprise appeared on Lady Piaomiao&rsquo;s visage.<br>Because at that very instant, the number appearing at the Spirit Formation entrance was &ldquo;one hundred and eight&rdquo;!<br>&ldquo;Heavens! It&rsquo;s a hundred and eight Martial Markings! There&rsquo;s only a difference of twelve markings to the record Murong Xun maintained!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Impressive. We thought the situation had already be set, but in the end, the most impressive one is actually Lady Chun Wu. A hundred and eight Martial Markings! That should already be enough for a Mortal Taboo martial skill, right?&rdquo;<br>The originally tranquil mountain peak boiled up in excitement again. No matter who, they did not expect Chun Wu to give them such a great surprise. A hundred and eight markings! That was really too surprising. To know, in comparison to Ya Fei, Zhan Feng, Murong Wan, Qiu Zhu, and the others, Chun Wu was an entire level below them! She was only a rank four Martial Lord!<br>At that instant, the others and even Ya Fei had faces full of astonishment. No matter what, she would not have thought in the end, she was defeated by Chun Wu, a rank four Martial Lord, even though Qiu Zhu did not surpass her, and Zhan Feng was inferior to her!<br>In reality, in comparison to Ya Fei and the others, Xia Yu and Dong Xue were more shocked because they had personally saw Chun Wu only capturing around a dozen Martial Markings within the Temple of Reproduction. Logically speaking, she shouldn&rsquo;t have so many Martial Markings. What exactly was going on?<br></p></div>
