        <h1>Chapter 5241</h1>
        <div>: I&rsquo;ll Let You Die a Knowing Death<br>&ldquo;Were you the one who said those words earlier?&rdquo; Situ Jingchuan asked furiously.<br>&ldquo;To think that you&rsquo;d ask such a question. Are you really a world spiritist?&rdquo; Chu Feng replied disdainfully.<br>He was mocking Situ Jingchuan for asking the obvious.<br>&ldquo;How did a black sheep like you appear in our Situ World Spiritist Clan?&rdquo;<br>Despite Situ Jingchuan&rsquo;s severe injuries, he was so infuriated that he wanted to make a move on Chu Feng. It was then that a horrified voice suddenly echoed amongst the crowd.<br>&ldquo;I-it&rsquo;s him! It&rsquo;s that fellow who crippled many of our brethrens&rsquo; cultivation in the Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm. H-h-h-he&hellip; isn&rsquo;t from our Situ World Spiritist Clan!&rdquo;<br>One of the juniors who had returned from the Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm recognized Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t a member of our Situ World Spiritist Clan, and he even crippled our brethrens&rsquo; cultivation?&rdquo;<br>A huge commotion broke out amongst the juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan.<br>Even those who hadn&rsquo;t heard of Chu Feng could tell from what they had just heard that he was a dangerous person. They quickly stepped further away, leaving Chu Feng completely isolated.<br>&ldquo;It really is him! How did he get in there?&rdquo;<br>More and more juniors who had returned from the Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm confirmed Chu Feng&rsquo;s identity.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s simple. Anyone who has your Situ World Spiritist Clan&rsquo;s bloodline is able to enter this place.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng took out a glass container that was much larger on the inside than what it showed on the outside. He activated the formation cast on the glass container, causing the aura inside to leak out.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our Situ World Spiritist Clan&rsquo;s bloodline! Why is it so condensed?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;D-doesn&rsquo;t this mean that he has already killed a lot of our people?&rdquo;<br>The juniors trembled with rage as they finally realized what was going on.<br>&ldquo;You beast! You deserve to be killed a thousand times over!&rdquo;<br>One of the rank eight Dragon Transformation Sensation prodigies exerted his spirit power on Chu Feng with the intention to crush him to death. Yet, he found that Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t fazed in the least by his spirit power.<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo;<br>The prodigy was stunned. He realized that Chu Feng might have been stronger than he had initially anticipated.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered.<br>He raised his hand and swiftly constructed a formation. The formation morphed into a massive hammer that smashed down on the prodigy.<br>The prodigy hurriedly constructed a protective formation to fend against the hammer, but it was futile. With a loud bam, he was smashed to bits along with his protective formation.<br>He was one of the three greatest prodigies of the Situ World Spiritist Clan, but he was killed just like that.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritist too?&rdquo; Situ Jingchuan asked in astonishment.<br>&ldquo;Are you an idiot? Why are you asking so many obvious questions? Kneel down!&rdquo;<br>As soon as Chu Feng exerted his spirit power, Situ Jingchuan fell to the ground like a dog. Even though the two of them were at rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation, Situ Jingchuan was completely helpless before Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Run!&rdquo;<br>Seeing that even Situ Jingchuan wasn&rsquo;t a match for Chu Feng, the other juniors immediately turned tail and fled.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late for you to be thinking about running away now,&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered.<br>With a casual wave of his hand, he formed a barrier around the area, trapping all of the juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan within. While the barrier was created on a whim, the juniors found themselves helpless before it. They couldn&rsquo;t break it down at all.<br>Knowing that they were already meat on a chopping board, their faces crumbled in despair.<br>The spectators outside were stunned as well, especially those who hadn&rsquo;t made sense of the situation yet.<br>&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Where did such a highly talented prodigy come from?&rdquo;<br>The eyes of the crowd were fixated on Chu Feng. They had never seen a junior as powerful as Chu Feng in the True Dragon Starfield before. Someone of his strength could easily build up a reputation for himself in the Totem Galaxy.<br>In contrast, Shengguang Daokui immediately grasped the situation. He finally understood why Chu Feng told him to conceal his appearance.<br>&ldquo;It turns out that his enemies are none other than the Situ World Spiritist Clan.&rdquo;<br>However, the revelation only spurred his excitement. He was enthused at the notion that such a formidable junior had come from their Holy Light Galaxy. While he was aware that Chu Feng was unlikely to be anyone ordinary, he had assumed the latter to be on the same caliber as the juniors of the Holy Valley, perhaps beneath them even.<br>Yet, Chu Feng turned out to be so powerful that Shengguang Daokui doubted if he would be a match for him.<br>He finally understood why the elders of the Holy Valley, including the proud Shengguang Baimei, were willing to befriend Chu Feng. Given how formidable Chu Feng was, they would have to be outright dumb to not befriend him!<br>&ldquo;Lord Tingye, it&rsquo;s clear that he&rsquo;s out to deal with our Situ World Spiritist Clan. Hurry up and use the formation to deal with him, or else our juniors might all die in his hands! That man won&rsquo;t show any mercy to our people!&rdquo; Situ Hongbo urged.<br>He knew that Situ Tingye was in possession of another formation their founder had left behind. This activation of this formation would suppress the cultivation and spirit power of all juniors inside the mountain valley to the same level. This ensured that all juniors had a fair chance of hunting down the spirit beasts.<br>It was just that their Situ World Spiritist Clan had never truly believed in fairness, so they rarely resorted to it.<br>However, that formation was the only way they could curb Chu Feng and save their juniors.<br>In truth, by the time Situ Hongbo started talking, Situ Tingye had already taken out the other formation token and invoked it. With the activation of the formation, a surge of spirit power spread across the entire mountain range.<br>Weng!<br>&ldquo;This feeling&hellip;my cultivation is being suppressed?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng could feel a powerful force lowering both his martial cultivation and spirit power down to rank one Martial Exalted level. The same applied for the juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan and the powerful spirit beasts too.<br>That was the power of the founder&rsquo;s formation.<br>&ldquo;Listen up, juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan. That vicious man before you has come with hostile intentions. You mustn&rsquo;t let him get away scot-free. I have suppressed his cultivation down to rank one Martial Exalted level alongside the rest of you. Use this opportunity to get rid of him and exact vengeance for our brethren!&rdquo; Situ Tingye projected his voice inside the mountain valley via the formation.<br>The juniors were aware of the existence of this formation and understood that this was a good opportunity for them to deal with Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Construct formation!&rdquo; Situ Jingchuan roared.<br>The juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan quickly channeled their spirit power together to form a massive formation. The massive formation shimmered with golden light as a ten thousand meters tall armored giant slowly climbed out from within.<br>The armored giant stood with an air of valiance as it pointed its spear at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Awakening General Offensive Formation! The prowess of the formation depends on how much the constructed general resembles a true living person.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As expected of the most formidable prodigy of the Situ World Spiritist Clan! Not only did he master the formation, but he was also able to construct it within the blink of an eye. It looks like he hasn&rsquo;t been slacking off on his training!&rdquo;<br>Some of the sharp-eyed onlookers recognized the formation and offered their compliments.<br>&ldquo;The person who barged into the spirit beast mountain valley is amazing too. With his talent, he could have easily become one of the powerhouses of the Totem Galaxy in the future, but it&rsquo;s a pity that he doesn&rsquo;t have a good brain.<br>&ldquo;The spirit beast mountain valley is the Situ World Spiritist Clan&rsquo;s territory. Even if the elders are unable to enter the mountain valley, they are still able to manipulate the conditions within via their founder&rsquo;s formations. With his fighting prowess suppressed to the same level as the other juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan, he&rsquo;s now in a disadvantageous position.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s already difficult enough as it is to deal with multiple cultivators of the same level at once, but the prodigy of the Situ World Spiritist Clan actually constructed such a formidable formation on top of that. That person is doomed to die here.&rdquo;<br>The crowd believed that Chu Feng was a goner here.<br>Boom!<br>Chu Feng suddenly thrust his palm out, unleashing a huge palm made out of spirit power. The juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan immediately toppled over, and the formation they had constructed in unison swiftly dissipated.<br>&ldquo;The hell! He was able to shatter such a powerful formation just like that?&rdquo;<br>The onlookers were dumbfounded.<br>The elders of the Situ World Spiritist Clan were also rendered speechless as that was already their most powerful formation. If Chu Feng was able to overcome even that, their juniors truly didn&rsquo;t stand a chance at all here.<br>The juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan stared at Chu Feng with bulging eyes as if he was some kind of monster. They could understand how they were powerless against Chu Feng earlier considering how they had been outclassed, but that wasn&rsquo;t the case here.<br>How in the world was Chu Feng able to breach their collaborative formation when they were all at the same spirit power? Was there really such a huge difference between true prodigies and ordinary cultivators?<br>&ldquo;Shameless fellow! You must have resorted to unorthodox means!&rdquo; Situ Jingchuan bellowed.<br>His fear couldn&rsquo;t be concealed despite his angry voice.<br>&ldquo;Do you label everything stronger than you as unorthodox means? You&rsquo;re truly a bunch of trash who doesn&rsquo;t know how big the world is,&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered.<br>&ldquo;How could you be so powerful if you didn&rsquo;t resort to unorthodox means?&rdquo; Situ Jingchuan questioned.<br>It was due to his inability to comprehend Chu Feng&rsquo;s overwhelming power that he was labeling it as an unorthodox means.<br>&ldquo;You want to know why? All right, I&rsquo;ll let you die a knowing death. Look at them. Do you know why they are all gathered here?&rdquo; Chu Feng pointed at the spirit beasts and asked.<br>&ldquo;This place was constructed by our founder. Needless to say, the spirit beasts must be gathered here for us. What does this have to do with you?&rdquo; Situ Jingchuan replied.<br>He still firmly believed that they were the ones who had caused the anomaly of the spirit beasts.<br>&ldquo;What does this have to do with me? Open your eyes and look closely!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng turned to the spirit beasts and said, &ldquo;Bow down.&rdquo;<br>The spirit beasts cried out in response before kneeling down before Chu Feng. This was already a shocking sight as it was, but what happened next was even more so.<br>The spirit beasts began to morph into surges of spirit power that gushed toward Chu Feng, reinforcing his spirit power.<br>The crowd felt goosebumps all over their bodies.<br>By this point, it was already clear that Chu Feng was the cause of the anomalies that had happened thus far. Why else would the spirit beasts obediently heed his orders?<br>They shuddered to imagine just how monstrously talented Chu Feng was!<br>Putong!<br>Situ Tingye fell to the ground. His eyes were almost bulging out of their sockets, and his mouth was so wide that it could fit an egg in. He was suffering a mental breakdown.<br>He thought that the anomalies spelled the rise of their Situ World Spiritist Clan, but it turned out that they were caused by an outsider instead. How could he possibly accept that?<br></div>
