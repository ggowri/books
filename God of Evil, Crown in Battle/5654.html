        <h1>Chapter 5654: Underhanded Means</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng was very fond of the sword in his grasp. He had been desiring the sword for a long time now, and he was fond of the power it bestowed upon him. He would have loved more than anything to monopolize it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Good sword!&rdquo; Chu Feng exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He began charging toward the black humanoid figure while dragging the sword on the ground, producing bright sparks of friction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Let me see what you&rsquo;re capable of,&rdquo; the black humanoid figure replied in excitement as he raised his saber in retaliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shockwaves rippled as Chu Feng and the black humanoid figure clashed. The latter was evidently stronger than when he confronted Fu Xing earlier, a sign that he had gotten serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the enhancements from the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Sacred Pill, the black sword, and Fu Xing&rsquo;s support formation, Chu Feng still fell into a disadvantageous position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nevertheless, Chu Feng was still able to hold his ground through his combat experience and ingenious swordsmanship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect a young lad like you to possess such outstanding combat skills! What a pity. I might have lost if </span><span>your</span><span> fighting prowess was just a little stronger,&rdquo; the black humanoid figure remarked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, you&rsquo;re speaking awfully arrogantly. Even if I&rsquo;m unable to defeat you, it&rsquo;s also true the other way around. Otherwise, why haven&rsquo;t you defeated me yet?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Is that so? It&rsquo;s too easy for me to defeat you,&rdquo; the black humanoid figure replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of teleportation energy enveloped him, and he instantaneously appeared in front of Fu Xing. Without any hesitation, he swung his massive saber down upon her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that he was unable to subdue Chu Feng, he decided to turn his attention to Fu Xing so that the latter couldn&rsquo;t support him anymore. It was the same plan as before!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Fu Xing didn&rsquo;t back down. With a roar, she infused even more power into the support formation, making it stronger than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black humanoid figure was confused. While Fu Xing was indeed weaker than Chu Feng, she should have noticed his attack. It didn&rsquo;t make sense for her not to dodge it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was then that he sensed a sharp pain in his saber-wielding hand. It had been sliced off!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly turned around and saw Chu Feng behind him with the massive black sword in hand. By then, Chu Feng was already pushing his black sword toward his chest, viciously pinning him down to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng could have claimed the black humanoid figure&rsquo;s life with that attack, but he chose to only subdue the latter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;My apologies, elder. I have no choice but to do this in order to win the battle,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Hahahaha!&rdquo; The black humanoid figure burst into laughter. &ldquo;I see, I see! The two of you intentionally hid your true prowess in order to make me lower my guard. You were biding your time for an opportunity to take me down. What an underhanded trick. You must do this often, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, it has nothing to do with me. It was his plan. He sent a voice transmission telling me to refrain from exerting the full prowess of the support formation till I receive his signal,&rdquo; Fu Xing said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was not trying to pin the blame on Chu Feng but just joking around. She realized that the black humanoid figure had been going easy on them despite his harsh attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, it&rsquo;s indeed my idea. It isn&rsquo;t Miss Fu&rsquo;s fault. You were too strong. We had no choice but to resort to such an underhanded method in order to defeat you. However, you&rsquo;re right to say that I use this method often,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a mischievous grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He often feigned weak in a battle, just so to catch his opponent off guard when he abruptly went all out. It was an exceptionally effective method.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good actor. I thought that you have already gone all out. I would have never thought that you were still holding back. Forget it, you&rsquo;re qualified to take the fruits.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of spirit power gathered around the black humanoid figure, as he freed himself from Chu Feng&rsquo;s sword and regenerated his severed arm. Neither Chu Feng nor Fu Xing was surprised to see that, as they had already known that he couldn&rsquo;t have only been at Royal Dragon God-cloak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black humanoid figure had only suppressed his spirit power to Royal Dragon God-cloak in order to match the two of them, which was also why Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t attempt to take his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the one hand, it would have been a futile attempt. On the other hand, he would only leave a bad impression behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black humanoid figure reached for the tree behind him, and two black fruits fell into his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;These two fruits are yours, but do think things through before consuming them,&rdquo; the black humanoid figure said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fu Xing frowned. She sensed that something was amiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black humanoid figure flicked his finger, and the two fruits fell into Chu Feng </span><span>and Fu Xing&rsquo;s hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, this fruit isn&rsquo;t poisoned, right?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t poisoned,&rdquo; the black humanoid figure replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good.&rdquo; Chu Feng swallowed the black fruit without any hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng!&rdquo; Fu Xing exclaimed in astonishment. She was worried since the black humanoid figure had already warned them against carelessly consuming the black fruit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Forget it!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she quickly made up her mind and consumed the black fruit too. She couldn&rsquo;t figure out what was wrong with the black fruit, so she decided to take a risk together with Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A black imprint appeared on Chu Feng&rsquo;s and Fu Xing&rsquo;s bodies as soon as they swallowed the black fruit. Not only did they enjoy a huge boost in their psyche, but their intelligence was greatly enhanced too. They quickly sat down, closed their eyes, and focused on self-reflection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wanted to grasp some enlightenment from the temporary boost in their intelligence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Fu Xing felt the effects of the intelligence boost fading, so she opened her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly turned to Chu Feng, only to see that his eyes were still closed. That made her widen her eyes in shock. Chu Feng had consumed the fruit earlier than her, so his intelligence boost should have faded earlier than her. How was it that Chu Feng was still cultivating even when her intelligence boost had already faded?</span></p></div>
