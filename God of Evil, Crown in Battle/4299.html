        <h1>Chapter 4298</h1>
        <div> - Mysterious Organization<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were over three hundred people standing in the starry sky and staring at the terrifying lump of clouds.<br>They were all wearing the same attire -- a dark grey gown. Special sort of black vein lines filled the gowns.<br>If one pays close attention, one would notice that the black vein lines resemble lightning.<br>But, as those black colored vein lines was very similar in color to the dark grey colored gown, one would not notice them if one didn&rsquo;t pay close attention.<br>Worthy of mentioning...<br>These people that were all standing orderly in midair, practically every single one of them were emitting an unfathomable aura.<br>Furthermore, every one of them was wearing hoods. Their hoods were joined to their gowns. Not only did the hoods cover their hair, it also covered half their face.<br>But, truth was, one could not clearly see their lower half of their faces not covered by the hoods either.<br>The reason for that was because they were all wearing masks, black colored masks.<br>Those masks were very strange looking. Not only did it cover their faces, it also covered their eyes.<br>But, their visions were not blocked by the masks at all.<br>&ldquo;Woosh---&rdquo;<br>Not long after, a figure flew over from the direction of the terrifying lump of clouds.<br>That person was wearing the same attire as this group of people. It was evident that the incoming individual belonged to the same group as these people.<br>After flying over, that person kneeled before the group of three hundred plus.<br>Turned out, even though this group of people were all emitting unfathomable auras, there was a disparity in status between them.<br>Among them, the two strongest individuals were standing at the foremost of the group.<br>These two people were most likely the group&rsquo;s leaders.<br>If one didn&rsquo;t pay extra close attention, one wouldn&rsquo;t notice there to be any difference in their attire from the rest of the group.<br>But, paying close attention, one could notice that the black vein lines on their gowns were more concentrated.<br>But, different from the others, the two of them had revealed a small amount of their hair from under their hoods.<br>One possessed white hair and the other possessed red hair.<br>&ldquo;Milords, I&rsquo;ve confirmed that it is two young men that are devouring that power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;One of them is the son of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Xianhai Shaoyu,&rdquo; reported the man who flew over from the terrifying lump of clouds.<br>&ldquo;So it really was Xianhai Shaoyu?&rdquo;<br>Hearing Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s name, the crowd grew restless.<br>Subconsciously, they all turned their gazes to the white-haired person of the two leaders.<br>Even that red-haired leader also looked to the white-haired leader.<br>But, compared to the others, the white-haired leader was rather calm.<br>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the other youngster?&rdquo; asked the white-haired leader.<br>&ldquo;This subordinate is unaware.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, he is likely not a young master of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan,&rdquo; said the person kneeling before the group.<br>&ldquo;You are certain that he&rsquo;s not from the Immortal Sea Fish Clan?&rdquo; asked the white-haired leader.<br>&ldquo;This subordinate has never seen that man among the people from the Immortal Sea Fish Clan,&rdquo; said the person kneeling on the ground.<br>&ldquo;Continue to monitor,&rdquo; said the white-haired leader.<br>&ldquo;Yes, Milord.&rdquo;<br>The person kneeling on the ground stood up and flew toward the terrifying lump of clouds again.<br>In a blink of an eye, he disappeared into the starry sky...<br>&ldquo;Is it really the power that you spoke of?&rdquo;<br>At this moment, the red-haired leader turned to ask the white-haired leader.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no mistake. Although it is the first time I see it too, that is most definitely that power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Immortal Sea Fish Clan has been searching for that treasure the entire time. They&rsquo;ve finally found it now,&rdquo; said the white-haired leader.<br>&ldquo;The Immortal Sea Fish Clan has always been a conceited group of people. They would not cooperate with outsiders.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, it seemed like the other youngster was not someone from the Immortal Sea Fish Clan. Who is he then?&rdquo; Curiosity filled the voice of the red-haired leader.<br>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have to worry about that. After all, the two of them are both within our grasp,&rdquo; said the white-haired leader.<br>&ldquo;Xianhai Shaoyu is the successor to the Immortal Sea Fish Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since he showed himself, there&rsquo;s most definitely someone protecting him from the shadows. Are we really going to act?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t we return to seek help from Lord Clan Chief and others?&rdquo; asked the red-haired leader.<br>&ldquo;There wouldn&rsquo;t be anyone protecting him from the shadows,&rdquo; said the white-haired leader.<br>&ldquo;Are you really certain about that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If he is being protected, we&rsquo;ll end up suffering miserably,&rdquo; said the red-haired leader.<br>&ldquo;Who else could know about the Immortal Sea Fish Clan better than me?&rdquo; The white-haired leader looked to the red-haired leader.<br>Even though his face was hidden by a mask and one cannot see his eyes, the red-haired leader could sense his gaze as he was being stared at.<br>That white-haired leader&rsquo;s gaze was filled with confidence.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, very few people understand the Immortal Sea Fish Clan better than you,&rdquo; The red-haired leader reached terms.<br>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll proceed according to my plan,&rdquo; said the white-haired leader.<br>&hellip;...<br>Meanwhile, Chu Feng and Xianhai Shaoyu were joining hands to take on the terrifying power.<br>But, doing so was no easy task. If they were slightly careless, they would be in fatal danger.<br>But, with the great effort put forth by the two men, the terrifying power that enveloped an entire region in the starry sky were finally all absorbed into their bodies.<br>At this moment, Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s complexion was deathly pale and he was gasping for breath. His condition was extremely weak. He resembled someone on the verge of dying.<br>But, excitement filled his face.<br>&ldquo;Finally, success. I, Xianhai Shaoyu, succeeded,&rdquo; sighed Xianhai Shaoyu emotionally.<br>When he turned his gaze to Chu Feng, he had a look of concern and distress on his face but also a selfish look of joy.<br>No matter how weak Xianhai Shaoyu was, he was at least conscious.<br>Chu Feng, on the other hand, had lost consciousness...<br></p></div>
