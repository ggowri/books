        <h1>Chapter 4865</h1>
        <div>: The Marriage Will Proceed As Agreed<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the main palace of the Dragon Clan, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief paced around the room with an anxious look on his face.<br>He knew that the Holy Light Clan&rsquo;s wedding procession had arrived, but Shengguang Yunyue and Long Xiaoxiao weren&rsquo;t around. There wasn&rsquo;t anyone for him to hand over.<br>Under normal circumstances, he would have opted to sell Chu Feng out so as to shake the blame off him. However, there was no way he could do that anymore after witnessing Chu Feng&rsquo;s capabilities and what he had done to Shengguang Yunyue, not to mention the poison he had been fed with.<br>He would be courting his own doom if he dared to sell Chu Feng out!<br>But he couldn&rsquo;t afford to mess with the Holy Light Clan either!<br>What was he supposed to do when he was stuck between a rock and a hard place?<br>&ldquo;That darned Chu Feng! Why does he have to meddle in things that are none of his business?&rdquo;<br>The Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief berated Chu Feng, but he only dared to whisper it out. His actions looked truly hilarious.<br>The Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was the only one in the main palace at the moment, but there were many other elders gathered outside. They were all from the upper echelons of the Dragon Clan, just that their usual grace and composure was nowhere to be seen.<br>They were pacing around nervously, worried as to why their clan chief hadn&rsquo;t stepped out of the main palace to welcome those from the Holy Light Clan yet. They were afraid that their clan chief might have regretted his decision to marry Long Xiaoxiao into the Holy Light Clan after seeing Shengguang Jiahao&rsquo;s appearance.<br>So, they tried to persuade him.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, I know that you dote on Princess Xiaoxiao, but you need to prioritize our clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, those who seek to make it big will have to sacrifice things they hold dear to them. We can&rsquo;t afford to offend the Holy Light Clan!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Shut your mouths!&rdquo; the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief bellowed.<br>Everyone immediately zipped up their mouths, but somehow, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief only looked even more troubled.<br>He wanted to prioritize the Dragon Clan too, but the ball was no longer in his hands.<br>&ldquo;Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, why do you look so troubled?&rdquo;<br>A voice suddenly echoed within the palace.<br>The complexion of the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief lit up immediately upon hearing the voice. He knew right away who it was from.<br>He turned his head toward the source of the voice, and indeed, it was no other than Chu Feng.<br>Long Xiaoxiao and her mother were with him too.<br>Of course, Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother had already morphed into Shengguang Yunyue&rsquo;s appearance, and the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference at all.<br>Not that he really cared though, considering that his eyes were focused on just Chu Feng.<br>He knew that Chu Feng was the one who would determine the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s fate from this day onward.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re finally back! Our Dragon Clan is facing the greatest crisis in many years. You have to save us!&rdquo;<br>The Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief looked at Chu Feng as if he was their savior. Had Chu Feng asked him to kneel down, he would probably do so without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation.<br>&ldquo;Calm down. The wedding ceremony will proceed as planned,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Proceed as planned? Young hero Chu Feng, are you really intending to let Xiaoxiao marry into the Dragon Clan? But look at Shengguang Jiahao&rsquo;s appearance! That&rsquo;ll only demean Xiaoxiao!&rdquo;<br>The Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief put on the image of a doting father, as if he was reluctant to let Long Xiaoxiao go to the Holy Light Clan.<br>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that the only way to save your Dragon Clan? If you really dote on Xiaoxiao, why don&rsquo;t I take her away from here right now so that she could be spared from all of this trouble?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng grabbed Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s wrist as he said those words, seemingly ready to walk away.<br>&ldquo;Wait wait wait! Young hero Chu Feng, you have always treasured our Xiaoxiao more than anything. I believe that you have your plans for marrying Xiaoxiao into the Holy Light Clan. I&rsquo;ll follow your arrangements.&rdquo;<br>The Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief immediately dropped the act and kneeled down to Chu Feng.<br>At this point, it was already clear to everyone that he harbored hardly a shred of feeling for Long Xiaoxiao. All of his care and concern were nothing more than an act. In truth, he would rather sell Long Xiaoxiao out than face the wrath of the Holy Light Clan.<br>That was just the kind of person he was.<br>It was only a relief that Long Xiaoxiao no longer harbored any expectations for her father, such that she no longer felt upset to see his reaction anymore.<br>The Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief heeded Chu Feng&rsquo;s instruction and entrusted Long Xiaoxiao to the Holy Light Clan&rsquo;s wedding procession.<br>Shengguang Jiahao might appear to be a fool, but he, too, knew that he was marrying someone today. He couldn&rsquo;t see Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s face due to a veil, but just her physique was more than enough to make him salivate.<br>With a shout of &lsquo;Wife!&rsquo;, he dashed straight toward Long Xiaoxiao.<br>Pah!<br>But before he could get close, Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother threw a slap on his face, sending him tumbling across the air.<br>&ldquo;Preposterous! You&rsquo;re bringing shame to the Holy Light Clan!&rdquo;<br>It was a heavy slap that left Shengguang Jiahao bawling pitifully. It went without saying that Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother was exploiting this opportunity to vent her anger, but no one dared to say a thing because she was disguised as Shengguang Yunyue at the moment.<br>No one would dare to cross Shengguang Yunyue carelessly, not even her fellow clan members.<br>When Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother declared that she would be riding in the same carriage as Long Xiaoxiao, no one dared to pose any objections either.<br>Chu Feng also snuck into the carriage as well. Once all three of them were inside, he quickly set up a barrier to seal off the area within the carriage before bringing the real Shengguang Yunyue and Shengguang Haifu out.<br>Due to the effects of the barrier, the two of them couldn&rsquo;t see Long Xiaoxiao and her mother. They could only see Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, please&hellip; let us go.&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Haifu and Shengguang Yunyue jolted in horror the moment they saw Chu Feng. Shengguang Haifu quickly kneeled onto the ground, and Shengguang Yunyue quickly followed suit.<br>The current Shengguang Haifu was covered in injuries, and the fear in his eyes looked even deeper than Shengguang Yunyue&rsquo;s. Naturally, the reason behind that was due to the torture of the black snakes.<br>Under such cruel torture that threatened to erode their sanity, it didn&rsquo;t take long for them to lose their dignity and willpower. At this point, all they wanted was the torture to end.<br>&ldquo;Look outside. See who it is,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>The two of them quickly did as they were told, and they saw the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, the elders of the Dragon Clan, as well as the few clan members of the Holy Light Clan.<br>Just by looking at their dress-up, they were able to swiftly figure out what was going on.<br>&ldquo;This is&hellip; the wedding procession sent by our Holy Light Clan? Has time&hellip; passed so quickly?&rdquo; Shengguang Haifu remarked in a daze.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;m intending to use the two of you as bargaining chips against the Holy Light Clan, so I need the two of you to be obedient. Otherwise&hellip; I&rsquo;m sure you know what will happen,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br></p></div>
