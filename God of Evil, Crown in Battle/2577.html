        <h1>Chapter 2576</h1>
        <div> - They&rsquo;re All Acquaintances<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;It would seem that not only is brother Chu Feng exceptionally talented, but even brother Chu Feng&rsquo;s friends are exceptional.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Truly, birds of a feather flock together. The friends of geniuses are also geniuses.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the crowd began to spout praises nonstop. No matter what, the Zhou Heavenly Clan and Kong Heavenly Clan were only able to trap Ying Mingchao and destroy Hero City by joining hands.<br>Although they had not planned to exterminate the entire Zhou Heavenly Clan, they also did not plan to spare the Zhou Heavenly Clan.<br>To take revenge against the Zhou Heavenly Clan was something that they had already been making plans for.<br>As for the current situation, it had saved them a lot of effort and time. As such, they would naturally rejoice.<br>&ldquo;Exceptional? That&rsquo;s more than exceptional, that person is simply stronger than Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>Lil Ball spoke eccentrically again.<br>Unlike others, he was not simply praising the person who extinguished the Zhou Heavenly Clan, he was mainly belittling Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It is the first time that we&rsquo;ve meet. Why are you so against me?&rdquo; Finally, Chu Feng was unable to contain himself, &ldquo;Could it be that it really is because of the position of Vice City Master?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, I can tell you that I have no interest in the position of Vice City Master. I have never planned to join Hero City.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng still hasn&rsquo;t joined Hero City?&rdquo;<br>The crowd were all startled by Chu Feng&rsquo;s words.<br>They had originally thought that Chu Feng had already joined Hero City.<br>Never did they expect that not only had Chu Feng not joined Hero City, but he never planned to join Hero City to begin with.<br>If that was the case, wouldn&rsquo;t it mean that their discussions and agreement to have Chu Feng become the Vice City Master simply meaningless?<br>Lil Ball was also very surprised. However, his surprise only lasted for a short moment. The reason for that was because he did not believe Chu Feng.<br>Thus, he asked, &ldquo;If you never planned to join Hero City, why did you build a palace especially for yourself in Hero City?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I am the one who built that palace for Brother Chu Feng. It was also true that he mentioned that he does not wish to join Hero City,&rdquo; Right at that moment, Ying Mingchao spoke.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually true?!&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the crowd all sucked in a mouthful of cold air. With Ying Mingchao verifying it, this meant that the matter was real.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng,&rdquo; Ying Mingchao looked to Chu Feng. Judging from his appearance, he seemed to want to persuade Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng naturally knew what he wanted to say. He most definitely wanted to persuade him to join Hero City and become the Vice City Master.<br>However, Chu Feng was already determined. Thus, before Ying Mingchao could say anything, Chu Feng said, &ldquo;Senior Ying, I appreciate your kindness. But, didn&rsquo;t we agree earlier that I will not be joining Hero City? Senior, you are truly making things difficult for this junior.&rdquo;<br>Hearing what Chu Feng said, Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s expression stiffened. Evidently, he felt quite apologetic.<br>After being silent for a moment, he said, &ldquo;I am the one in the wrong here. I should have consulted with you beforehand. For me to decide things without your approval, I have indeed made things difficult on you. Brother Chu Feng, I hope that you do not take offense to my actions.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, as long as you do not force this junior, you will not be making things difficult for me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Forget about it. If you do not wish to join, then you do not need to join. However, Hero City will forever remain your home,&rdquo; Ying Mingchao said.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Seeing that Ying Mingchao had decided to not urge Chu Feng to join, the others present started to become restless.<br>They knew very well how talented Chu Feng was. Even without mentioning how Chu Feng had saved Ying Mingchao, merely by how talented Chu Feng was, they wanted to rope him into Hero City.<br>Thus, the people present all wanted to speak to urge Chu Feng to join Hero City.<br>Seemingly able to tell what the crowd were thinking, Ying Mingchao looked to everyone and said, &ldquo;Since Brother Chu Feng is not planning to join Hero City, everyone, do not make things difficult for Brother Chu Feng either.&rdquo;<br>With Ying Mingchao having spoken, even though the crowd felt regret in their hearts, they could not disobey Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s orders. Thus, they nodded, and no longer tried to attempt to persuade Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Senior, this junior is somewhat exhausted from the journey outside. If there&rsquo;s nothing else, I will return to rest.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng clasped his fist to the crowd. Then, he took a glance at that Lil Ball and turned around to leave.<br>&ldquo;Senior Ball, now you know that you&rsquo;ve been overly worried, no?&rdquo; Li Haoyang turned to ask Lil Ball.<br>Lil Ball did not answer. Merely, his expression turned increasingly ugly. As matters stood, he had also realized that he had targeted Chu Feng wrongly.<br>As for Chu Feng, he did not return to his palace to rest. Instead, he planned to take a breath of fresh air outside Hero City.<br>On the way out, Her Lady Queen said, &ldquo;Chu Feng, do you think that person really was Zhao Hong?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If it really was her, it would a very good thing.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Chu Feng naturally knew that it would be a good thing. After all, if it really was Zhao Hong, this would mean that she currently possessed the strength to eliminate a True Immortal and extinguish the Zhou Heavenly Clan. In other words, her current cultivation would be at least that of a True Immortal.<br>Merely, for some unknown reason, Chu Feng felt that the person who did that was not Zhao Hong.<br>However, if it was not Zhao Hong, then who did it?<br>Chu Feng walked very fast. As he pondered, he had already arrived at the gates to Hero City.<br>The outside of Hero City could be described as extremely crowded. Countless people had arrived to pay their respects. There were those that had come to pay respect to Ying Mingchao, and those they had come to pay respects to Chu Feng.<br>However, more than either of those, were the people that wanted to join Hero City or become an ally of Hero City.<br>Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s reputation was truly grand. Even though he had disappeared for over a thousand years, there were still countless people that wanted to hug his thigh.<br>After all, the news of him extinguishing the Kong Heavenly Clan alone had already spread through the entire Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>Furthermore, as a True Immortal, he had managed to regain the power of his Divine Body.<br>Everyone knew that upon reaching the True Immortal realm, the power of one&rsquo;s bloodline or Divine Body would all be restricted.<br>If one was able to undo the restriction upon their power, they would become more powerful than other True Immortals.<br>However, very rarely would people be able to accomplish that sort of thing. Currently in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, only Ying Mingchao had managed to accomplish that.<br>As such, Ying Mingchao had already become the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm&rsquo;s number one expert in the hearts of the crowd.<br>Chu Feng did not wish to create a sensation, and also did not wish to chat with others. Thus, he concealed himself, making it so that others would not notice him.<br>If it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that Hero City was covered with a spirit formation making it so that people could only come and go through its several gates, Chu Feng would&rsquo;ve directly soared into the sky. He would not have gone through the trouble of walking among the crowd.<br>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that Liu Xiaoli?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed.<br>He had saw a familiar face among the crowd. It was the Society Master of the Red Butterfly Society, Liu Xiaoli. The members of the Red Butterfly Society were also with her.<br>Liu Xiaoli had come with the intention of joining Hero City with her Red Butterfly Society and becoming their subsidiary power.<br>However, judging from her appearance, Liu Xiaoli had been rejected.<br>&ldquo;That was truly looking down upon another with their cur eyes. Never would I expect for there to also be that sort of scum in Hero City,&rdquo; Seeing that scene, Chu Feng felt extremely furious. It was not only because Liu Xiaoli was his friend, but it was also because the person who had rejected Liu Xiaoli was mocking and ridiculing her.<br>In fact, that person even spoke to insult Liu Xiaoli and the rest of her Red Butterfly Society.<br>Although Hero City did consider strength when choosing powers to become allies with, to insult another was against the rules of Hero City.<br>Furious, Chu Feng planned to reveal himself and criticize that individual that was insulting Liu Xiaoli and the others.<br>&ldquo;Truly, a small sect like this wants to become allies with Hero City? Scram immediately. Do not waste our time.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a large hand suddenly extended from behind Liu Xiaoli. That hand grabbed Liu Xiaoli&rsquo;s shoulder and directly flung her away.<br>A strong wind was raised at the same time Liu Xiaoli was flung away. The others from the Red Butterfly Society were all thrown to the ground with her.<br>Although the power behind that fling and the wind was not very strong, and Liu Xiaoli and the others were not injured, Liu Xiaoli and the others rolled on the ground multiple times before finally being able to stabilize themselves.<br>As there were a lot of people present there, they all witnessed the scene. At that moment, mocking laughter began to resonate.<br>Regardless of whether they might be from Hero City, people that had come to pay respects or people that had come to become allies, they all began to laugh at Liu Xiaoli and the others.<br>Chu Feng was able to clearly notice that Liu Xiaoli and the others had very embarrassed expressions on their faces.<br>Their expressions indicated that they were wishing to immediately get up and leave that place. They felt that they had been truly humiliated.<br>Chu Feng felt very pained upon seeing that scene. However, more than feeling pain, he felt anger.<br>When Chu Feng cast his furious gaze to the person that flung Liu Xiaoli and the others away, his gaze changed again.<br>That&hellip; was actually also a familiar face.<br><br></p></div>
