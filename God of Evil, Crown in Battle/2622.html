        <div> - Overflowing Demonic Aura<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Killing me? What makes you think you can kill me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that you think the Incomplete Imperial Armament in your hand will be able to kill me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh, my mistake, that&rsquo;s not an Incomplete Imperial Armament that you&rsquo;re holding. Rather, that&rsquo;s a Demon Armament. I&rsquo;ve heard that it&rsquo;s quite powerful too. Wasn&rsquo;t it said that it could kill True Immortals?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I&rsquo;ve also heard that you will suffer from a backlash from your Demon Armament after using it. Furthermore, it seems that backlash is quite intense too,&rdquo; The Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster said to Chu Feng mockingly.<br>Even though Chu Feng had unleashed his Evil God Sword, the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster was still looking at Chu Feng with the same sort of expression that he was looking at Ying Mingchao with earlier -- an expression of disdain.<br>He had simply never placed Chu Feng&rsquo;s Evil God Sword in his eyes at all.<br>&ldquo;You will soon know what sort of power it possesses,&rdquo; Chu Feng said coldly.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that you are determined to fight against me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, don&rsquo;t say that I haven&rsquo;t warned you. Even if you are to use your Evil God Sword, you will still simply not be a match for me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason for that is because the Dragonscale Dagger in my hand is an actual Incomplete Immortal Armament!!!&rdquo;<br>As the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster spoke, he raised the Incomplete Immortal Armament in his hand. A golden ray shot into the sky. Upon reaching the sky, that golden ray started to spread. In the blink of an eye, it fused with the black gaseous flames.<br>The golden radiance and the black gaseous flames were reflecting upon one another. As they covered the sky, it was as if light had fused with darkness. It gave off a peculiarly shocking sensation.<br>Most importantly, the enormous power of that Incomplete Immortal Armament was fully revealed.<br>Not only was the appearance of the sky changed, but one could feel the might of the Incomplete Immortal Armament from several miles away.<br>The allied army that was in the center of the Incomplete Immortal Armament&rsquo;s might was pushed back repeatedly. Even Zi Xunyi was unable to withstand it.<br>That said, it was fortunate that Zi Xunyi was here. Otherwise, Chu Feng and the others would&rsquo;ve already been completely destroyed by that oppressive might.<br>Sure enough, that was a weapon that Ancestral Armaments could not compare against. Even rank two True Immortals were unable to contend against it.<br>&ldquo;No matter how strong a Demon might be, it is still powerless before an Immortal. For your Demon Armament to encounter my Dragonscale Dagger, it is like a rain dragon encountering an true dragon. The only possible end will be for it to be suppressed,&rdquo; The Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster spoke proudly.<br>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, Chu Feng tightened his grasp on his Evil God Sword. Then, his power started to flow into the Evil God Sword.<br>The next moment, the Evil God Sword that originally appeared to be extremely ordinary started to emit crimson gaseous flames. Wave upon wave, the flames twisted about the sword.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Immediately afterward, with the sky above Chu Feng&rsquo;s head as the center, crimson clouds appeared in the sky covered by the dark black gaseous flames and the golden radiance.<br>The crimson clouds were surging violently. In the blink of an eye, they completely swallowed the dark black gaseous flames and the golden radiance.<br>At this moment, the only thing present in the sky were the crimson clouds.<br>The crimson clouds surged about in a very imposing and domineering manner. It was as if they were telling everyone that this was its domain.<br>The crimson clouds were overflowing with demonic aura. Before this demonic aura, the heinous air emitted by the dark black gaseous flames that covered the sky earlier were simply unable to compare.<br>At this moment, not to mention the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster, even the people behind Chu Feng turned pale with fear.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng&rsquo;s body was currently completely covered by crimson gaseous flames. Chu Feng was also emitting boundless amounts of demonic aura from his body.<br>That demonic aura was simply too frightening. It was simply the most frightening aura that all these people had ever felt.<br>Even though Chu Feng was not targeting them, they felt their blood run cold and felt fear from the bottoms of their hearts.<br>In fact, even the previous complacent Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster revealed a frown on his face after seeing the sky covered by the crimson clouds.<br>When he looked to Chu Feng&rsquo;s Evil God Sword again, there was no longer the disdain he revealed earlier in his eyes. Instead, a restraining fear had emerged in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Quite an imposing aura. Merely, I wonder if it is true ability, or a bluff,&rdquo; The Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster said.<br>&ldquo;You will soon know whether it is a bluff or not,&rdquo; Chu Feng said indifferently. After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes suddenly turned sharp.<br>He suddenly pointed his Evil God Sword at the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster. Then, from the crimson clouds in the sky, several hundred clusters of crimson gaseous flames were shot down.<br>Those crimson gaseous flames were very peculiar. They were like vines. They were connected to the crimson clouds, but were also extending rapidly. With an unimaginable speed, they pierced toward the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster.<br>The Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster had originally thought that Chu Feng&rsquo;s attack would strike toward him directly from the Evil God Sword when Chu Feng pointed it at him.<br>As such, he never anticipated for the crimson clouds to contain the Evil God Sword&rsquo;s power. Moreover, he never expected that Chu Feng would be able to control that power to unleash such a fierce attack.<br>Being caught off-guard, he immediately slashed with his Dragonscale Dagger and sent forth many golden blade rays to slice apart the crimson gaseous flames. However, even with that being the case, he was still pierced by a crimson gaseous flame.<br>That crimson gaseous flame pierced into the arm that he was grabbing Ying Mingchao with. Then, a &lsquo;rip&rsquo; was heard as gaseous flames emerged from his arm.<br>&ldquo;Ahhh!!!&rdquo;<br>At the same time that happened, the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster let out a painful scream.<br>Half of his arm had already been sliced off by the crimson gaseous flames. To be exact, it was not sliced off, but rather burned off.<br>After the arm was burned, the crimson gaseous flames actually wound around Ying Mingchao and tossed him toward Chu Feng and the others.<br>That said, even though they were both covered by the crimson gaseous flames, the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster ended up having his arm burned off, whereas Ying Mingchao was completely unharmed.<br>&ldquo;Exactly what the hell is this?!&rdquo;<br>At this moment, the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster was still grimacing in pain. When he looked to the location of his burned arm, he started to panic even more.<br>At this moment, crimson gaseous flames were still present on his arm. Although the speed was very slow, they were still burning away at his arm.<br>The Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster tried to use the black gaseous flames from his demonic technique to try to extinguish the crimson gaseous flames to relieve his pain, heal his injuries and regrow his arm.<br>However, even though he possessed an extremely vast amount of dark black gaseous flames in his body, so much that it was like the vast sea against a little stream when compared to the crimson gaseous flames burning away at his arm, when his dark black gaseous flames moved toward the crimson gaseous flames, they not only failed to extinguish it, but they instead increased its size and intensity.<br>The dark black gaseous flames emitted by the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster were actually devoured by the crimson gaseous flames.<br>Not only had the crimson gaseous flames devoured the dark black gaseous flames, but they also transformed its power to its own.<br>The strangeness of the crimson gaseous flames had completely surpassed the anticipation of the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo;<br>The Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster raised the Dragonscale Dagger in his hand and hacked it down upon his burning arm.<br>He had directly sliced off the portion of his arm that was affected by the crimson gaseous flames.<br>This was the only option he had. Otherwise&hellip; if the crimson gaseous flames were to continue spreading, they would sooner or later cover his entire body. At that time, he might be killed.<br>After he sliced off his arm, he was now able to heal his injury. In the blink of an eye, he reformed his arm.<br>Merely, at this moment, there was no longer only restraining fear in his eyes when he looked to Chu Feng&rsquo;s Evil God Sword. Instead, there was deep fear.<br><br></p></div>
