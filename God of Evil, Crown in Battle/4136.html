        <div> - Absolute Suppression<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, the lightning began to dissipate.<br>Soon, Zuoqiu Tiancheng began to appear before the crowd.<br>Upon closer inspection, the crowd noticed that the armor Zuoqiu Tiancheng wore had practically shattered.<br>Furthermore, signs of being struck by lightning were present all over him.<br>He was also injured.<br>Yet, his overall condition appeared to be fine.<br>Even though he was injured, the injuries did not reach deep into his core. Whilst appalling in sight, the injuries were light in their severity.<br>&ldquo;Woooahhh~~~&rdquo;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Success! Young Master Tiancheng succeeded!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young Master Tiancheng managed to successfully withstand the legendary Divine Lightning Affliction!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, jubilant shouts exploded from the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen. They were all overjoyed.<br>They&rsquo;d all managed to confirm that their young master Tiancheng had successfully broken through.<br>&ldquo;Wait, something&rsquo;s amiss&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The cheering noises soon came to a sudden stop.<br>As more lightning continued to dissipate, another figure appeared.<br>That person was Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s armor had shattered completely.<br>The extent of the destruction to his armor was much more thorough than Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s armor.<br>Moreover, his body was also covered in wounds that had been caused by the lightning.<br>However, the injuries on Chu Feng&rsquo;s body were clearly lighter than Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s injuries.<br>This greatly surprised the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>As Chu Feng had been the Lightning Guide he should&rsquo;ve died.<br>Furthermore, from the condition of his armor it showed that he should&rsquo;ve received even fiercer lightning strikes than Zuoqiu Tiancheng.<br>Thus, why would his injuries be lighter?<br>Furthermore, it was not only slightly lighter, but much lighter than Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s injuries.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, young master Tiancheng&rsquo;s aura doesn't seem to have changed,&rdquo; Zuoqiu Hanxun said all of a sudden.<br>Once he heard those words, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s expression turned extremely ugly.<br>Zuoqiu Hanxun was correct. Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s aura was still the same.<br>He was still a rank two Utmost Exalted.<br>However, two lightning tribulations had clearly struck the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.<br>This should&rsquo;ve meant that Zuoqiu Tiancheng had received two successive breakthroughs.<br>Unless...<br>Suddenly, everyone reacted to what had happened. They all turned their eyes to Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng had originally been concealing his cultivation.<br>However, after he sensed the crowd&rsquo;s gazes he revealed a long-awaited smile.<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng&rsquo;s clothes began to flutter.<br>In the next instant, his aura surged violently from his body like a ferocious beast.<br>In the blink of an eye, Chu Feng&rsquo;s aura rushed out from the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation and covered the entire region.<br>All the people present were able to sense his aura.<br>The current Chu Feng was no longer a rank eight Exalted.<br>He had become an Utmost Exalted-level expert.<br>Even though his cultivation was only that of a rank one Utmost Exalted, it was sufficient to cause the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen to vomit blood in anger.<br>It turned out that it was not Zuoqiu Tiancheng who had made two successive breakthroughs. Instead, it was Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually not Zuoqiu Tiancheng?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that guy that was meant to be the Lightning Guide?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Seems like an even more amusing show is about to start.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Good, good. This show is simply getting too good.&rdquo;<br>Above the clouds, the girl from the Dragon Clan became exceptionally excited and even started cheering.<br>Seeing the unexpected change, even the old man who stood behind her revealed a look of expectation.<br>He had felt that being able to witness the legendary Divine Lightning Affliction had been a great show.<br>However, the current situation was much more exciting than he had imagined.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&hellip;!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;!&rdquo;<br>Zuoqiu Tiancheng had turned red with anger.<br>He pointed at Chu Feng with a trembling hand. However, he was unable to say anything.<br>He was simply unable to accept everything before his eyes.<br>Chu Feng smiled. Then, he said, &ldquo;My apologies. That Divine Lightning Affliction was not triggered by you. Instead, it was triggered by me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Actually, it&rsquo;s simply impossible for you to trigger a Divine Lightning Affliction. Even if you are able to successfully make a breakthrough, you&rsquo;ll only be able to trigger ordinary Tribulation Lightning.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique that you&rsquo;ve trained in is incomplete. As such, how could you possibly encounter the legendary Divine Lightning Affliction?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng did not mask his ridicule towards Zuoqiu Tiancheng in the slightest.<br>After all, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan had wanted to use his life as Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s stepping stone.<br>There was no reason for him to show mercy towards such a clan.<br>&ldquo;Bullshit! You stole the breakthrough opportunity that should&rsquo;ve belonged to me! Yet you dare say that my Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique is incomplete?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You despicable bastard! I&rsquo;ll kill you!&rdquo;<br>Zuoqiu Tiancheng grew mad with rage, and sent forth an explosive punch at Chu Feng.<br>His punch contained extremely strong martial power.<br>That martial power was filled with killing intent.<br>Zuoqiu Tiancheng was unable to tolerate what Chu Feng had done.<br>Thus, he was not holding back in the slightest. He fully intended to kill Chu Feng with that one punch.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>However, his overwhelming martial power disappeared before Chu Feng.<br>This scene shocked everyone, especially the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Zuoqiu Tiancheng, Zuoqiu Daoyi and Zuoqiu Hanxun.<br>As the upper echelons of the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan, they all knew that Zuoqiu Hanxun had placed a treasure capable of restricting world spirit techniques inside the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.<br>Logically, Chu Feng shouldn&rsquo;t be able to use his world spirit techniques, and thus shouldn&rsquo;t be able to block Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s punch.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip; this is impossible!&rdquo;<br>Soon, the crowd realized what had happened.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation had changed.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation was no longer that of a rank one Utmost Exalted, but rather a rank two Utmost Exalted.<br>The reason for Chu Feng&rsquo;s change in cultivation was due to the mark that had appeared on his forehead.<br>It was precisely what appeared on his forehead that shocked the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen so much that they were unwilling to accept it.<br>A Lightning Mark had appeared on Chu Feng&rsquo;s forehead.<br>The dazzling &lsquo;Divine&rsquo; character baffled all of the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>No matter what, they would&rsquo;ve never imagined that Chu Feng had also trained in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.<br>Most importantly, practically all the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen could tell that the Lightning Mark on Chu Feng&rsquo;s forehead was much more dazzling than Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s Lightning Mark.<br>The oppression they felt in their bloodlines that they were under Chu Feng&rsquo;s Lightning Mark suppression was also substantially more powerful.<br>They were clearly both Divine-level Lightning Marks. Why would there be such an enormous distinction?<br>Could it be that Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique was really incomplete?<br>&ldquo;This&hellip; this is impossible, impossible!&rdquo;<br>Compared to the others, Zuoqiu Tiancheng was even more incapable of accepting it.<br>He was completely stunned.<br>&ldquo;You must&rsquo;ve discovered it too.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an enormous distinction between your Lightning Mark and mine.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The distinction serves as the best proof as to the fact that you&rsquo;ve not trained your Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique wholly,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Zuoqiu Tiancheng.<br>&ldquo;Bullshit!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You despicable bastard! I&rsquo;ll have you die!&rdquo;<br>As Zuoqiu Tiancheng spoke, his body shifted and shot straight for Chu Feng.<br>Furthermore, an additional item had appeared in his hand. It was a silver sword.<br>That was not an ordinary sword. Instead, it was an Incomplete Exalted Armament.<br>Holding that sword in hand, Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s battle power increased significantly.<br>The silver sword began sending out ripples.<br>That was not an ordinary attack. It was an Immortal Technique specifically meant for swords.<br>However, facing such an attack, Chu Feng&rsquo;s body merely shifted to the side as he easily dodged it. Then, he flicked his fingers explosively, like two dragons rushing out from the ocean.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Using only his two fingers, Chu Feng actually managed to lock Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s Incomplete Exalted Armament infused with his Immortal Technique in place.<br>&ldquo;You dared to use me as the Lightning Guide?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Tried to use my life to aid you in making a breakthrough?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet you actually have the nerve to call me despicable?&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng twisted his fingers and Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s Incomplete Exalted Armament trembled violently.<br>Then, Chu Feng waved his arm.<br>With that, Zuoqiu Tiancheng, together with his Incomplete Exalted Armament, were flung away in a crushing defeat.<br>Not only was he thrown into the air, but his Incomplete Exalted Armament had also flown out of his hand.<br>Even though Zuoqiu Tiancheng had ultimately managed to stabilize himself and landed on the ground in a steady unembarrassing manner, those with discerning eyes all noticed that the palm that he had held his Incomplete Exalted Armament with had been bloodied.<br>This scene deeply shocked all the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>One must know that Zuoqiu Tiancheng was their Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s greatest talent.<br>Whether it be his battle power or his battle experience, Zuoqiu Tiancheng had fully revealed his genius-level caliber without restraint.<br>Under the same cultivation, simply no one was able to contend against him.<br>Yet, their absolute genius had been absolutely suppressed!<br>Even though they were outside the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation, the suppression from Chu Feng was still enough to nearly suffocate them.<br>How could there be such a terrifying person of the younger generation in the world?<br>How could their young master Tiancheng be suppressed to such a degree?!<br></p></div>
