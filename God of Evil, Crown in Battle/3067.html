        <h1>Chapter 3066</h1>
        <div> - Extremely Ridiculous<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Chu Feng, isn&rsquo;t that Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing the image of Chu Feng, the crowd were all astonished. After all, Chu Feng was an existence known to everyone in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>Merely, Chu Feng had already died. As such, how could he appear in the Upper Realm Gate and defeat the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations?<br>Not to mention being dead already, even if he were still alive, he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to accomplish that. In the crowd&rsquo;s knowledge of Chu Feng, no matter how powerful Chu Feng might be, he would still not be a match for the current Chu Zhiyuan.<br>The Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations were surprised by the astonished reactions from the people of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. It was Li Youbin who managed to react first. With a low voice, he said, &ldquo;Chu Feng, that&rsquo;s a familiar-sounding name.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Chu Xuanyuan have a son called Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Chu Xuanyuan does have a son by the name of Chu Feng. However, wasn&rsquo;t it said that his son had been imprisoned in the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s forbidden area together with him and died because he was unable to withstand the power of the forbidden area?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, I&rsquo;ve also heard that Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son had already died. Moreover, even if that really is Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son, wasn&rsquo;t his son labelled as trash incapable of cultivating? How could he possibly defeat us?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations were unable to contain themselves, and began to talk among themselves.<br>After all, Chu Xuanyuan was simply too grand of an existence. Thus, Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son was an existence the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield had paid attention to.<br>After discussing it among themselves, the strongest among them, Li Yan, stood forth. He pointed to Chu Feng&rsquo;s portrait and asked Chu Hanpeng, &ldquo;Senior, is that man Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He is indeed Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; Chu Hanpeng said.<br>&ldquo;It really is Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son?!&rdquo; The Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations were all astonished upon finding out about this. After all, they had heard rumors of Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son before.<br>According to what they knew, not only was Chu Feng already dead, but he was even someone incapable of cultivating when he was still alive.<br>If the one that defeated them was truly Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son, it would be an extremely serious situation.<br>At the very least, it would mean that Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son was not a nobody.<br>&ldquo;However, for you to say that it is him who defeated you all, it is very unlikely for that to be the case,&rdquo; Chu Hanpeng said.<br>&ldquo;Unlikely? Why would it be unlikely? It was clearly him who made things difficult for us inside the Upper Realm Gate. That is something that we have personally witnessed. Are you implying that we&rsquo;ve mistaken him for someone else?&rdquo; Li Tianyou said.<br>&ldquo;The reason for that is because Chu Feng is already dead,&rdquo; Chu Hanpeng said.<br>&ldquo;Senior, my brothers can verify that the one that injured them in the Upper Realm Gate was indeed that Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This matter is absolutely true. Yet, you&rsquo;re using the pretext of Chu Feng being dead to shield him. I feel that you&rsquo;re looking down on us too much here, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, could it be that you&rsquo;re really considering us as fools?&rdquo; Li Yan asked.<br>He simply did not believe that Chu Feng had died. Thus, he only felt what Chu Hanpeng said to be an excuse from their Chu Heavenly Clan to protect Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Strange, wasn&rsquo;t little friend Chu Zhiyuan the one who entered the Upper Realm Gate? Why would the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations insist on saying that it was Chu Feng, and not little friend Chu Zhiyuan?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that Chu Feng really didn&rsquo;t die, and that it is Chu Zhiyuan that&rsquo;s lying?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, faced with the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations sticking to their statement, many people of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm began to suspect Chu Zhiyuan.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng has died. This matter is absolutely certain. Moreover, the one who destroyed the Upper Realm Gate&rsquo;s main formation is someone else. Thus, we are not shielding Chu Feng. Rather, little friends, you all are deliberately stirring up trouble without cause,&rdquo; Chu Hanpeng said.<br>&ldquo;We are deliberately stirring up trouble without cause? The way I see it, it is you all that are deliberately stirring up trouble without cause.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What did you all say earlier? That the Upper Realm Gate&rsquo;s main formation was destroyed by that guy? In other words, you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s him who defeated us?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How could someone like him even be qualified to defeat us?&rdquo; Li Tianyou pointed to Chu Zhiyuan. His words were filled with contempt.<br>At that moment, everyone turned their gazes to Chu Zhiyuan.<br>Even though they all knew that Chu Feng had died, they were unable to help but suspect if Chu Zhiyuan had really entered the Upper Realm Gate based on the attitude of the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>At that moment, Chu Zhiyuan was placed in a very difficult situation, and was feeling an enormous headache.<br>Ignoring the question of Chu Feng being alive, merely the question of who it actually was that destroyed the Upper Realm Gate&rsquo;s main formation was already an enormous worry to him.<br>However, there was nothing he could do about it. He could not admit before all these people that he had not entered the Upper Realm Gate, that the main formation was not destroyed by him.<br>If he were to admit that, it would not only be a question of humiliation, all of his credit would be ruined, and he would become the laughingstock of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>At that moment, Chu Zhiyuan was no longer capable of stopping midway. He could only force himself to cling to his claims.<br>Otherwise, his illustrious name would be completely destroyed.<br>Chu Zhiyuan pointed at the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations and loudly shouted, &ldquo;Enough of your endless pestering. I am the one who destroyed the main formation in the Upper Realm Gate. Furthermore, when I entered the Upper Realm Gate, I simply did not see you there at all, much less injure any of you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For you all to inexplicably appear here now and declare that the one who destroyed the main formation was a dead person, exactly what is your intention? Even if you&rsquo;re looking for trouble, you should&rsquo;ve found a better justification than that.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do not use such an absurd excuse to justify your trouble-seeking!&rdquo;<br>Chu Zhiyuan was truly a person who had endured humiliation for many years for the sake of his goal. In terms of putting on a show, he was truly proficient.<br>Thus, he was not only speaking with righteousness, but he was also speaking with a very reprimanding tone. It was as if the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations were truly lying and there to seek trouble.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? You&rsquo;re truly capable of speaking.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Please, do not plaster gold all over your face. Why don&rsquo;t you look at your own strength first. How could someone like you possibly dare to declare themselves to be the one to destroy the Upper Realm Gate&rsquo;s main formation?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, stand the hell aside. You should go and find a mirror to look properly at yourself, and judge exactly what you&rsquo;re capable of.&rdquo;<br>Chu Zhiyuan&rsquo;s words were immediately met with ridicule from the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>After all, they were not lying. What they had said was the truth.<br>Thus, to them, what Chu Zhiyuan said was simply a joke, an extremely ridiculous and funny joke.<br></p></div>
