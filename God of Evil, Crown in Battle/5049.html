        <div>: The Way to Save the Galaxy<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Chu Feng and Wang Yuxian had already entered the passageway beyond the spirit formation gate. The structure of the passageway was quite simple, and it wasn&rsquo;t very long either, but the two of them were having trouble passing through it.<br>Every step they took was incredibly arduous, resulting in a slow speed of progression.<br>Waves of spirit power were battering down on them ceaselessly from all directions, leaving them feeling as if needles were stabbing into their bodies. The aggression was exceptionally intense from the front as if it was trying to deter them from advancing any further.<br>Chu Feng moved his arm swiftly to form a barrier whereas Wang Yuxian took shelter by his side. Despite the two of them traveling together, Chu Feng was single-handedly blocking the attacks coming from the formation.<br>There were two reasons for that.<br>One, it was impossible to block off the spirit power battering down on them. Chu Feng and Wang Yuxian had tried using spirit power, martial power, treasures, and weapons to protect themselves, but nothing could stop the aggression of the spirit power.<br>In other words, they had to suffer the battering of the spirit power. There was no way to circumvent that.<br>Two, while the spirit power would deal damage to both Chu Feng and Wang Yuxian, Chu Feng fared relatively better than Wang Yuxian in taking the damage. That was why Wang Yuxian&rsquo;s complexion looked worse even though she was being shielded here.<br>If Wang Yuxian had to take the full brunt of the spirit power over an extended period of time, she would have died without a sliver of doubt.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I&rsquo;m sorry. I came here wanting to help you, but I ended up becoming a burden.&rdquo;<br>Hiding behind Chu Feng&rsquo;s arm, Wang Yuxian could only watch helplessly as Chu Feng frantically flung his arms around to shield her from the spirit power. It made her feel guilt-ridden.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say such foolish words. Since we came in together, we should leave this place together too,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.<br>Despite bearing the full brunt of the spirit power, he wasn&rsquo;t fazed by the pain at all. Any other people would have probably found it intolerable, but it only felt like a prickling pain to him. It was still bearable to him.<br>This was the greatest strength that Chu Feng possessed from undergoing countless trials&mdash;willpower. It allowed him to persevere in times of hardship and suffering.<br>On top of that, for some reason, this spirit power was also less damaging to him than Wang Yuxian. It would have been fatal to Wang Yuxian if she tried to forcefully endure it.<br>Chu Feng had no idea what had resulted in this difference, but he wasn&rsquo;t in the mood to ponder about it. He knew that he had to leave this place as soon as possible. That was the only way for them to ensure their safety.<br>Fortunately, the only ordeal he had to face here was this prickling spirit power. There were no other defensive mechanisms along the way. While it took them a while, they were able to get out of the passageway safely.<br>On the other side of the spirit formation gate was a brand new world.<br>It resembled nature&rsquo;s paradise, filled with fragrant flowers, lush trees, and chirping birds. There were uniquely-designed buildings amidst the trees.<br>Yao Cheng was standing right beside the spirit formation gate, waiting for the two of them. From the smile on her face, it looked like they had succeeded.<br>&ldquo;You actually managed to do it. It has been eight hundred years since anyone outside of our Monstrous Spirit Clan has passed through the spirit formation gate and entered this place.&rdquo;<br>Yao Cheng looked at Chu Feng and Wang Yuxian with eyes brimming with tears as if this was something huge.<br>&ldquo;Elder, why do you say that it has been eight hundred years? Hasn&rsquo;t the Monstrous Spirit Clan already gone into seclusion for tens of thousands of years?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked curiously.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng and Miss Wang, the two of you wish to know the way to saving the Nine Souls Galaxy, right? I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is right now.<br>&ldquo;The rumors are true. Our Monstrous Spirit Clan obtained powerful energy from an esteemed lord, which allowed us to become much stronger in a short period of time. The Nine Souls Sacred Clan learned about it and thought that we were a threat to them, so they sought to destroy us. Fortunately, our clan chief was prepared for that. She ordered our clan members to move the energy to this place.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a pity that we were still too late. The Nine Souls Sacred Clan has already made its move before our Monstrous Spirit Clan can migrate over to this place. Only the clan members responsible for moving the energy survived by chance.<br>&ldquo;To be frank, the ones who survived are all the weaker ones. We have no idea how to control the energy, and we didn&rsquo;t dare to leave this place and exact vengeance on the Nine Souls Sacred Clan either.<br>&ldquo;But eight hundred years ago, a highly talented man visited our Monstrous Spirit Clan. He learned how to control the energy within a short period of time. Combining the energy together with the bloodline of our Monstrous Spirit Clan, he created an army of puppets for us before taking his leave. This army of puppets is the key to saving the Nine Souls Galaxy,&rdquo; Yao Cheng said.<br>&ldquo;Elder, how strong are these puppets?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>The cultivators from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect were extremely powerful, such that even the Netherworld Envoy wasn&rsquo;t a match for them. He wasn&rsquo;t certain if the puppet army was really a match for them.<br>&ldquo;There are 9832 puppets in total. 4000 of them are at rank seven Martial Exalted level, 3000 are at rank eight Martial Exalted level, 2000 are at rank nine Martial Exalted level, and the remaining ones are at Half-God level,&rdquo; Yao Cheng replied.<br>Chu Feng and Wang Yuxian were shocked to hear that. Wouldn&rsquo;t that mean that 832 of the puppets are at Half-God level?<br></p></div>
