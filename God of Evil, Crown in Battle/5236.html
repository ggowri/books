        <h1>Chapter 5236</h1>
        <div>: Meeting Someone From the Same Homeland<br>It was not that Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t feel pain but that he was enduring it.<br>There was no way around it. He was worried that if he couldn&rsquo;t even grasp the simplest Divine Concealment with ease, the Divine Deer might just be reluctant to teach him the other two secret skills.<br>That further reinforced his willpower and pain tolerance.<br>In a single breath, he absorbed the entire light bundle that the Divine Deer had given to him.<br>&ldquo;Elder, I can continue on,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with an outstretched hand.<br>&ldquo;Are you certain?&rdquo;<br>The Divine Deer stared at him with eyes that looked almost as if she was staring at a lunatic.<br>&ldquo;Yes, I am certain,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.<br>Fearing that the Divine Deer didn&rsquo;t trust him, he quickly wiped off the beads of sweat that had formed around his forehead.<br>&ldquo;I know that you can continue, but I have already imparted the energy for Divine Concealment to you. Even if you suck me dry, I have nothing else to give you,&rdquo; the Divine Deer replied.<br>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked in surprise.<br>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; the Divine Deer replied speechlessly.<br>She didn&rsquo;t think that Chu Feng would actually be able to fully assimilate her energy in a breath. In her view, he would have taken at least a few months to a few years for that. Yet, he actually completed the process within less than an hour.<br>&ldquo;This brat is truly a monster,&rdquo; the Divine Deer thought in her heart.<br>Meanwhile, Chu Feng tried sensing the energy he had just assimilated. Using that energy was no easy feat. It would be impossible for ordinary cultivators to utilize it, and talented cultivators would take quite some time for it.<br>However, Chu Feng was sharp-witted and had a fair amount of experience in this. He could quickly grasp the crux of the energy and practice with it. Before long, he was able to draw out the divine energy and wrap it around his own body.<br>That resulted in his aura completely disappearing.<br>&ldquo;Elder, is this a success?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>The Divine Deer stared at Chu Feng in utter bewilderment. It took a long time before she finally snapped out of it. Never in her wildest dream did she imagine that Chu Feng would be able to pull it off so easily.<br>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t feel it yourself?&rdquo; the Divine Deer asked.<br>It went without saying that Chu Feng was able to feel it himself. His aura was so thoroughly hidden that he was confident that no one would be able to find him if he used it together with his concealment formation.<br>In the art of concealment, concealing one&rsquo;s aura was much more important than concealing one&rsquo;s body. Be it a cultivator&rsquo;s martial power or a world spiritist&rsquo;s spirit power, their detection mainly relied on sensing auras.<br>&ldquo;Haha, I&rsquo;m asking you because I&rsquo;m not sure about it,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a joyous smile.<br>As long as he used Divine Concealment together with his concealment formation, he was confident that not even those from the Situ World Spiritist Clan would be able to do anything about him.<br>&ldquo;How is my Divine Concealment?&rdquo; the Divine Deer asked.<br>&ldquo;Not too bad. Elder, can I try learning Divine Flitting too?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to reach Half-God level before learning Divine Flitting, or else your body wouldn&rsquo;t be able to take it. That being said, you can give it a try if you want to.&rdquo;<br>The Divine Deer opened her palm and manifested a sliver of white light.<br>&ldquo;Try refining it. Remember, you should do it bit by bit,&rdquo; she warned before sending the sliver of white light toward Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng quickly sat down and tried assimilating the sliver of white light.<br>Weng!<br>As soon as he took in the sliver of white light, it erupted into a humongous flood of energy that frenziedly rampaged within his body. It felt as if countless needles were trying to tear him apart inside out.<br>Even so, Chu Feng gritted his teeth and bore with it. He was able to pull through it, but he found himself completely drained by the time he rose to his feet once more.<br>&ldquo;Hu&hellip; It&rsquo;s truly hard to bridge a difference in cultivation level,&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head and replied.<br>He was indeed too weak to withstand the power of Divine Flitting.<br>He wasn&rsquo;t aware that the Divine Deer was looking at him with eyes filled with disbelief. She had only told him to give it a try, but he had actually assimilated all of it in a single breath.<br>While she hadn&rsquo;t put much of her energy into the sliver of light, the clear gap in cultivation level here should have made it impossible for Chu Feng to bear it regardless of how strong his willpower was. In fact, she expected him to immediately back down after giving it a quick try.<br>Yet, Chu Feng actually managed to endure it.<br>&ldquo;You may leave now. Don&rsquo;t bother calling me when you&rsquo;re in danger&mdash;I won&rsquo;t help you. I&rsquo;ll impart to you Divine Flitting after you reach Half-God level,&rdquo; the Divine Deer said.<br>The power of teleportation wrapped itself around Chu Feng and expelled him from her realm. After he was gone, a smile slowly crept on the Divine Deer&rsquo;s face.<br>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think that he would be able to grasp Divine Concealment that quickly. Despite being in a lower cultivation level, he was also able to withstand the power of Divine Flitting. He&rsquo;s truly a monster amongst monsters. I never thought that I would be this lucky. To think that I nearly missed out on such a talent.&rdquo;<br>The Divine Deer had a radiant smile on her face.<br>&hellip;<br>&ldquo;Elder, don&rsquo;t you want to talk with me a little longer? Aren&rsquo;t you bored?&rdquo;<br>Despite having his consciousness expelled from the Divine Deer&rsquo;s realm, Chu Feng still tried to reach out to her, only to be ignored.<br>&ldquo;Elder, feel free to look for me whenever you&rsquo;re bored. I&rsquo;ll be your conversation partner.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was overjoyed to have grasped Divine Concealment. He didn&rsquo;t feel as worried now that he knew that he had cleared the Divine Deer&rsquo;s trial and could learn Divine Flitting once he reached Half-God level.<br>Once he grasped Divine Flitting, there wouldn&rsquo;t be as many people who could pose a threat to him anymore.<br>Now that he had secured an escape means, what he had to do next was to find a junior of the Situ World Spiritist Clan. Fortunately, he did know of a place where he could head to.<br>From scanning the vicinity of the mountain range with his spirit power earlier, he learned that there was a famous tavern nearby that was somewhat similar to the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber that the Netherworld Envoy had previously brought him to.<br>It was a mobile tavern that purely sold alcohol, and it was known as the Qian Clan Tavern.<br>Despite its humble name, the Qian Clan Tavern was actually second only to the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber in terms of reputation in the Totem Galaxy. It wasn&rsquo;t as hard to drink its wine as the Dragon Spring, but a crowd was guaranteed to form whenever it appeared.<br>Chu Feng was certain that he would find juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan there, so he quickly made his way to the Qian Clan Tavern.<br>The Qian Clan Tavern consisted of a floating cluster of palaces constructed out of golden bricks, looking both extravagant and crude at the same time. Wine could be purchased from any of the palaces, but there was a long queue outside every single one of them.<br>Only when those inside the palaces were done drinking could those queuing outside enter.<br>This was a rare sight for Chu Feng. None of the cultivators queuing in front of the palaces were weaklings or bumpkins. It would have taken something extraordinary for them to patiently queue up like ordinary mortals.<br>However, Chu Feng quickly noticed that no one was queuing in front of the most resplendent palace. Curious, he made his way over.<br>&ldquo;Welcome to our Qian Clan Tavern. Young hero, are you here to have a sip of wine?&rdquo; an elder stepped forward and greeted him.<br>&ldquo;I have heard of the fragrance of the Qian Clan Tavern&rsquo;s wine and would like to give it a try,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Our Qian Clan Tavern&rsquo;s wine is indeed fragrant. However, young hero, you should queue at the other palaces if you wish to have a sip of our wine. I recommend heading over to that side; there are fewer people there. You should be able to get in within two days&rsquo; time,&rdquo; the elder said.<br>&ldquo;Does this palace not sell any wine?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>He raised his head and looked at the plaque hanging above the palace. It contained the words &lsquo;Superior Immortal Wine Pavilion.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You see, young hero, our Superior Immortal Wine Pavilion sells immortal wines that have been aged for over ten thousand years, so the prices could be exorbitant. A bowl of Superior Immortal Wine costs an Exalted Armement.&rdquo;<br>The elder looked at Chu Feng playfully, seemingly waiting for the latter to reveal a shocked or embarrassed expression. However, Chu Feng&rsquo;s face remained perfectly impassive.<br>&ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;<br>Right after saying those words, he began making his way into the Superior Immortal Wine Pavilion.<br>The elder quickly raised his hand to stop him.<br>&ldquo;Young hero, were my words unclear? A single bowl of Superior Immortal Wine costs an Exalted Armament,&rdquo; the elder emphasized.<br>&ldquo;I heard you loud and clear,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Young hero, it&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m looking down on you, but our tavern rules dictate that customers have to fork out an Incomplete Exalted Armament before they are allowed to access our Superior Immortal Wine Pavilion.&rdquo;<br>Despite maintaining a smiling face, the elder&rsquo;s skepticism couldn&rsquo;t have been any clearer. From the very start, he had already deemed Chu Feng to be a poor bloke.<br>Chu Feng took out an Incomplete Exalted Armament and tossed it toward the elder. It was a top-quality Incomplete Exalted Armament!<br>&ldquo;Young hero, this way please.&rdquo;<br>The elder&rsquo;s smile changed into a genuine one, and his tone became respectful and courteous.<br>An Incomplete Exalted Armament was worth a fortune too. Some of the smaller clans might even regard it to be their family heirloom. A person who was willing to fork out an Incomplete Exalted Armament as an entrance fee had to be either rich or had a powerful background, let alone someone who was willing to give out a top-quality one.<br>Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t bothered by the elder&rsquo;s change in attitude. After all, it was the elder&rsquo;s job to chase away those who weren&rsquo;t qualified to enter the Superior Immortal Wine Pavilion.<br>Incomplete Exalted Armaments used to be treasures to Chu Feng, but there was now a huge collection inside his Cosmos Sack. He also had quite a few ordinary Exalted Armaments too.<br>Needless to say, he got those from robbing others.<br>The tavern was large but there weren&rsquo;t many people inside. Some of them had already started drinking. These people were definitely no ordinary personages, considering how they were willing to trade an Exalted Armament for a bowl of wine.<br>It didn&rsquo;t take long for a person to catch Chu Feng&rsquo;s attention.<br>It was a white-haired old man with a domineering air. From his facial features, he was likely to be a dashing hunk in his younger years. There was a black token hanging on his waist with the words &lsquo;Holy Valley&rsquo; inscribed on it.<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s from the Holy Valley?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was surprised to meet someone from the Holy Valley here.<br>In truth, he had the worst impression of the Holy Light Clan. There was even a period of time when he identified himself as a member of the Ancestral Martial Galaxy because he didn&rsquo;t think that the Holy Light Clan was worthy of ruling over the galaxy.<br>But after he got acquainted with Shengguang Baimei and Shengguang Buyu, his impression of the Holy Valley improved a little. It was out of respect for them that he chose to identify himself as a member of the Holy Light Galaxy afterward.<br>Those from the same homeland would often feel an inexplicable sense of intimacy with one another when meeting in a foreign land. It was the same for Chu Feng too, which prompted him to head straight for the old man&rsquo;s table.<br>&ldquo;Elder, may I share a table with you?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Of course, young friend. Please have a seat,&rdquo; the old man replied warmly.<br>&ldquo;Elder, are you from the Holy Valley?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;You have heard of our Holy Valley?&rdquo; the old man asked in surprise.<br>Chu Feng could tell from the old man&rsquo;s reaction that he was from the Holy Valley.<br>&ldquo;To be honest with you, I am from the Holy Light Galaxy too. I have befriended a few friends and elders from the Holy Valley,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Oh? May I know whom you are acquainted with?&rdquo;<br>The old man&rsquo;s interest was piqued.<br>&ldquo;Shengguang Baimei, Shengguang Buyu, Daoist Niantian&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng listed the people whom he was closer to in the Holy Valley.<br>&ldquo;Young friend, you actually know them? If that&rsquo;s the case, you should have heard of me too, right?&rdquo; the old man asked in delight.<br>&ldquo;Elder, may I know your name?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I am Shengguang Daokui.&rdquo;<br>The old man spoke those words with utmost confidence. He even straightened his back and tidied up his clothes, waiting for Chu Feng to recognize him.<br>However, his face crumbled the next moment when it became apparent from Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression that he didn&rsquo;t recognize him.<br></div>
