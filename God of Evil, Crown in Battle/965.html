        <h1>Chapter 965</h1>
        <div> - The Slash that Destroys Everything<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>Duels demanded individual strength.<br>Group combat demanded mutual understanding of each other.<br>When millions of people were fighting, all varying in cultivation strength, taking care of one another would greatly reduce the degree of injury and the number of dead.<br>At that moment, the Crippling Night Demon Sect was attacking the Immortal Execution Archipelago and the Three Great Monstrous Clans. Although there was a vast disparity in numbers, no matter individual strength or collective strength, the Crippling Night Demon Sect was far superior to their opponents.<br>This was like dozens of millions of cultivation experts in comparison to ten million trained elites. The one weaker and the one stronger was absolutely evident.<br>&ldquo;AHH&mdash;&rdquo;<br>A never-ending stream of painful cries resounded in the sky. An endless number of people fell dead from the air within the battlefield. However, amongst ten dead there were at least nine and a half who were from the Immortal Execution Archipelago or the Three Great Monstrous Clans. In the exchange just now, the Immortal Execution Archipelago&rsquo;s army had already entered a very perilous situation. If nothing were changed, their defeat was inevitable.<br>&ldquo;This is too terrifying. It&rsquo;s said the Crippling Night Demon Sect&rsquo;s army not only holds horrifying strength, they are very well trained as well. That seems to be absolutely true. Even though the Immortal Execution Archipelago allied with the Three Great Monstrous Clans, they are no match for the Crippling Night Demon Sect.&rdquo; As the observers watched the brilliant coordination, they were very amazed.<br>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not all. There&rsquo;s no doubt that the Crippling Night Demon Sect is powerful, but who would dare to say the Immortal Execution Archipelago and the Three Great Monstrous Clans are weak?<br>&ldquo;The reason for such an oppressing advantage is partially due to the commands of the Four Protector, but the most important thing is still because the entirety of the Crippling Night Demon Sect rose in strength.<br>&ldquo;And the reason for that is because of the Demon Sealing Sword. Just now, I felt it. The power it released has made the Crippling Night Demon Sect fierce; however, the person who grasps the Demon Sealing Sword is Chu Feng!<br>&ldquo;So, in the end, the reason for their overwhelming advantage is Chu Feng!&rdquo; explained a shrewd person to the crowd.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng?!&rdquo; After hearing those words, several hundreds of millions of people couldn&rsquo;t help casting their gazes towards Chu Feng. Only then did they discover he remained as calm as the very beginning, looking as if he knew he would win. Such absolute confidence was worn on his face.<br>&ldquo;Using a formation to raise their strength&hellip; Truly shameless.&rdquo; Murong Mingtian&rsquo;s complexion was very unsightly. After a furious roar, he raised his palm, and pushed it forward. Layers of King-level Martial power flew towards the Crippling Night Demon Sect. In the end, he couldn&rsquo;t help himself from attacking.<br>*whoosh* However, in the instant Murong Mingtian made his move, Chu Feng suddenly waved the Demon Sealing Sword in his hand. A black blade of energy sliced through the air, and also through Murong Mingtian&rsquo;s attack.<br>&ldquo;Murong Mingtian, do you not want face? Didn&rsquo;t you say you would allow them to fight, and you wouldn&rsquo;t do anything? Do you not know what &lsquo;keeping true to your word&rsquo; is after living for several hundred years?&rdquo; Chu Feng mocked after cutting through the attack.<br>&ldquo;Keeping true to one&rsquo;s word? I, Murong Mingtian, do not do anything like that to enemies. I only know the victor is king, and the loser is the villain. The world only remembers the side that won,&rdquo; Murong Mingtian shouted, and as he wielded the Royal Armament in his hand, he attacked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;The victor is king, and the loser is the villain. However, that does not mean nothing else matters. Today, I will openly defeat you!&rdquo; Chu Feng brought a smile to his face as he faced Murong Mingtian, who held a Royal Armament and exuded the pressure of a rank seven Martial King. He was not the slightest bit afraid.<br>*whoosh*<br>Suddenly, slight movements came from Chu Feng&rsquo;s body, then he instantly disappeared. When he reappeared, he had already come up to Murong Mingtian. Moreover, the Demon Sealing Sword was mercilessly slicing down.<br>Even though Chu Feng had already shown extremely powerful strength, Murong Mingtian was not afraid. Waving the Royal Armament in his hand, he slashed towards Chu Feng&rsquo;s Demon Sealing Sword. He was meeting force with force&mdash;Royal Armament with Royal Armament. With this, he was going to display his strength of a rank seven Martial King to guard his dignity.<br>*clang*<br>Finally, the two collided, but after a huge explosion, Murong Mingtian&rsquo;s wrist actually trembled, and his body quivered slightly as well. Like an arrow, he was shot back.<br>&ldquo;How is this possible? This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Murong Mingtian was stupefied. He could very clearly feel the Royal Armament in his hand violently trembling. It was not just a simple fear&mdash;it was very deep fear, so much it lost its will to fight.<br>The reason for such a reaction was naturally because of the Demon Sealing Sword in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand. The king of Royal Armaments&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t as simple as just a mere title. The deterrence it exuded would truly make other Royal Armaments fear it.<br>At first, Murong Mingtian even thought he could compensate for the Royal Armament&rsquo;s disadvantage with his rank seven Martial King strength and thus suppress Chu Feng. But no matter what, he would not have expected that he underestimated Chu Feng&mdash;a very severe underestimation. With the assistance of the Demon Sealing Sword, Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength had far surpassed his own.<br>*whoosh*<br>When Murong Mingtian was shocked back, light shone beneath Chu Feng&rsquo;s feet, and he once again flew over and came up to Murong Mingtian. The Demon Sealing Sword had been emanating pressure. It was prepared to attack Murong Mingtian again.<br>&ldquo;Brat, don&rsquo;t underestimate me!&rdquo;<br>Even though he knew of Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength, Murong Mingtian was furious&mdash;Chu Feng was not cautious at all as he continued to chase after him. He was clearly looked down on him.<br>Amidst bitterness, he too attacked. Although he held the Royal Armament in his hand, he did not wave it. Instead, he waved his sleeve, and released a boundless Martial power.<br>It immediately started coalescing, became innumerable weapons.<br>Blade, spear, sword, halberd, hatchet, axe, hook, fork, dagger, rod, lance, club, whip, truncheon, hammer, claw&hellip;<br>Every single one of the myriad weapons contained strength no inferior to a Royal Armament. When over ten thousand weapons equal to Royal Armaments gathered together, one could imagine its power.<br>This was not a simple attack&mdash;it was a martial skill. It was not a simple martial skill either&mdash;it was a very profound rank nine martial skill.<br>Its might was very frightening, and everyone was deeply drawn towards this martial skill&rsquo;s strength.<br>But the most shocking thing was Chu Feng&rsquo;s lack of intention to stop, even when facing a martial skill like that. He wasn&rsquo;t even planning to use a martial skill of his own to counterattack. He was aiming to use the Demon Sealing Sword to meet these weapons equivalent to Royal Armaments.<br>*whoosh*<br>Finally, Chu Feng made his move. The Demon Sealing Sword in his hand quickly slid through the air, and a black blade of energy flew out.<br>It was simple invincible and unstoppable. It brought forth destruction in all the areas it passed. It was absolutely devastating as it shattered all the Royal Armaments made by the martial skill.<br>With just one strike, Chu Feng destroyed Murong Mingtian&rsquo;s rank nine martial skill.<br></p></div>
