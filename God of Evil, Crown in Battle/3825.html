        <h1>Chapter 3824</h1>
        <div> - All Trash<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though those people of the younger generation all felt enormous hatred for Chu Feng, they did not dare to provoke him again, and could only act obediently while cursing him out in their hearts.<br>As for Chu Feng, he seemed to be able to see through their thoughts. Thus, whenever he felt anyone to be displeasing to his eyes, he would give them a tongue-lashing.<br>However, those people of the younger generation simply did not dare to go against him.<br>Those people reacted as if they were seeing Yama, the King of Hell, when they saw Chu Feng. They could only try to avoid him in fear of provoking him.<br>Feeling helpless, they turned their gazes to Meng Rufei and Yin Zhuanghong multiple times.<br>They even went as far as to send voice transmissions to them...<br>They wanted to ask for help from Meng Rufei and Yin Zhuanghong. They wanted them to curb Chu Feng.<br>After all, among the people present, only they would be capable of restraining Chu Feng.<br>However, Meng Rufei and Yin Zhuanghong completely ignored their pleas for help.<br>Meng Rufei was completely focused on Yin Zhuanghong.<br>As for Yin Zhuanghong, she was completely focused on the spirit formation ahead of them.<br>At the beginning, Meng Rufei had been breaching the spirit formations with his own strength.<br>Later on, he started to rely more on Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s guidance and indications.<br>Of course, it was likely that only Chu Feng was able to tell. The others were simply unable to tell at all.<br>The others all felt that it was due to Meng Rufei alone that they were able to continue journeying onward without being impeded.<br>As they continued onwards, they passed through forests, crossed over mountains, went deep underground and traversed cave tunnels.<br>Currently, the crowd found themselves in a tunnel. The surroundings of the tunnel were composed entirely of bronze.<br>At the end of the tunnel were sixteen copper gates. All the gates were the same size. Even their keyholes were exactly the same.<br>The only differences lay in the talismans on the copper gates.<br>The talismans were very peculiar. They seemed like drawings and words at the same time. If one were to look closely, one would notice that they were actually squirming. However, once one pulled their gaze back, they would see that they were still immobile. In short, the talismans were very mystical.<br>It should be mentioned that the keyholes matched the key held by Fan Chou.<br>Because of that, the crowd realized that if they wanted to open the copper gates, they merely needed to use Fan Chou&rsquo;s key.<br>However, it seemed like there was only a single chance. Thus, they must strike the right target on the first go. If the wrong gate was opened, the consequences might be unthinkable.<br>&ldquo;Fan Chou, give me the key.&rdquo;<br>After examining the gates, Meng Rufei seemed to have an answer. He extended his hand and demanded that Fan Chou hand him his key.<br>&ldquo;The key belongs to Fan Chou, why should he give you it?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng did not have any antipathy for Meng Rufei. However, he was not fond of his aloof and conceited attitude.<br>The tone he used when he spoke to Fan Chou earlier was extremely demanding, as if Fan Chou was his servant. The key clearly belonged to Fan Chou. Yet, Meng Rufei did not speak with a tone of request. Instead, he was simply ordering Fan Chou.<br>Faced with Chu Feng standing up for Fan Chou, Meng Rufei narrowed his brows. Displeasure flashed through his eyes. However, he did not say anything, and instead looked to Fan Chou again, &ldquo;Open the third gate.&rdquo;<br>However, right after his words left his mouth, Chu Feng said, &ldquo;Open the fourth one.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are you deliberately opposing me?&rdquo; Meng Rufei looked to Chu Feng. Anger surged in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;I am not trying to oppose you. I am merely making the correct choice," said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Correct choice? What makes you qualified to make the correct choice? Who do you think you are?&rdquo; Meng Rufei asked with a stern voice.<br>Chu Feng ignored Meng Rufei. He looked to Fan Chou, &ldquo;Brother Fan, trust me. Open the fourth gate.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, an oppressive might suddenly started wreaking havoc. Many people of the younger generation were overturned by it.<br>Upon reacting to what had just happened, the crowd&rsquo;s expressions all changed enormously. That said, what appeared in their eyes was not only shock. There was also joy.<br>The reason for that was because that oppressive might had come from Meng Rufei.<br>Meng Rufei had decided to act. Finally, he had decided to act. Most importantly, they were able to feel Meng Rufei&rsquo;s cultivation.<br>Rank one Exalted. Meng Rufei was a rank one Exalted.<br>The people of the younger generation felt that Meng Rufei, with that cultivation, was a peak-level existence among the Reincarnation Upper Realm&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>Although they could not handle Chu Feng, Meng Rufei was capable of handling him. After all, he was a rank one Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Earlier, you were showing off your strength and bullying others. I, Meng Rufei, gave you enough face to not bicker with you about it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet, you dare to meddle in my business? With that, I must make you realize who is actually in charge here.&rdquo;<br>Meng Rufei narrowed his sword-like brows. His long hair fluttered in the wind. He resembled a god of slaughter, and appeared very majestic and imposing.<br>However, Chu Feng showed no trace of fear facing such a Meng Rufei. In a very calm and undisturbed manner, he said, &ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the case, I might as well make things clear to you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The people present here are all trash in my eyes.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course, that&rsquo;s excluding him and her.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng pointed to Fan Chou, who stood beside him, and Yin Zhuanghong, who stood behind Meng Rufei.<br>After he finished saying those words, he looked back to Meng Rufei, &ldquo;You understand what I mean?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t, I can clarify things even more for you. You are included in the people I consider trash.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Courting death!&rdquo;<br>Meng Rufei exploded with anger. His boundless oppressive might swept forth. His oppressive might turned into hundreds of millions of ferocious beasts as they rushed towards Chu Feng to attack him.<br>Meng Rufei was not only planning to simply teach Chu Feng a lesson. He was simply trying to kill Chu Feng.<br>The reason for that was because his attack emitted a very intense killing intent. Everyone present was able to sense it.<br>&ldquo;Humph.&rdquo;<br>Faced with the killing intent-filled Meng Rufei, Chu Feng let out a cold snort. Then, a strong wind swept out from his body and straight toward Meng Rufei&rsquo;s attack.<br>In an instant, the ferocious beasts all shattered. Meng Rufei&rsquo;s oppressive might was dispersed, and his attack was easily crushed by Chu Feng.<br>As for Meng Rufei, he was sent flying, and crashed ruthlessly into a wall.<br>When he fell to the ground, he started coughing nonstop. Blood was even present in his cough.<br>&ldquo;Sssss~~~&rdquo;<br>Seeing such a thing, the crowd all gasped in shock and fear.<br>They'd never imagined that even the rank one Exalted Meng Rufei would be defeated by a single attack from that Asura.<br>Exactly what level of cultivation did this Asura fellow possess?<br>Could it be that he was a rank two Exalted?<br>As the crowd looked to Chu Feng, the fear in their eyes grew even more intense.<br></p></div>
