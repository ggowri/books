        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>&ldquo;Daoist Demon Crane, does this mean that the Demon Crane has opened?&rdquo; someone asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Of course, of course. I was just joking with everyone earlier. I brought the Demon Crane here because I knew it was about to be opened. I did some calculations and figured that&hellip; there are fated people here.&rdquo; Daoist Demon Crane suddenly changed his attitude and smiled.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Milord, does this mean that we can enter now?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The world spiritists present were starting to get excited. They knew that they would benefit from entering the Demon Crane.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Of course. You are all allowed to enter the Demon Crane since it has opened,&rdquo; Daoist Demon Crane said.</span><br><span>Countless silhouettes rushed toward the Demon Crane&rsquo;s mouth right away.</span><br><span>Uwa!</span><br><span>Cries of agony ensued.</span><br><span>Some of the world spiritists who had eagerly rushed forward crashed into an invisible wall. The majority of them got off with a hiss of pain, but a few of them had their heads bleeding from the impact.</span><br><span>Furthermore, the formation hadn&rsquo;t blocked everyone. Juniors were still able to enter the Demon Crane&rsquo;s mouth without impediment.</span><br><span>&ldquo;An invisible formation.&rdquo;</span><br><span>The crowd quickly realized what had happened. A restriction had been imposed to limit who could enter the Demon Crane, but this was bizarre as there had never been any restrictions on the Demon Crane before.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Milord, why did you impose a restriction on the Demon Crane?&rdquo;</span><br><span>A few confused world spiritists turned to Daoist Demon Crane.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Cough cough.</span><br><span>As I have mentioned earlier, I brought the Demon Crane because there&rsquo;s a fated person here. I imposed the restriction on the Demon Crane because the fated person is a junior,&rdquo; Daoist Demon Crane said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Milord, do you mean that the rest of us aren&rsquo;t allowed to enter the Demon Crane?&rdquo; someone in the crowd asked.</span><br><span>Daoist Demon Crane didn&rsquo;t answer the question right away. He leaped down from the Demon Crane and touched the invisible barrier before answering, &ldquo;Mm.&rdquo;</span><br><span>The excited world spiritists lowered their heads in disappointment.</span><br><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something off with Daoist Demon Crane,&rdquo; Eggy said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I think so too. I can&rsquo;t tell whether he&rsquo;s feigning ignorance or that he&rsquo;s no longer in control of the Demon Crane,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>Daoist Demon Crane was obviously acting awkwardly as if he didn&rsquo;t know what was going on with the Demon Crane. It looked like he was unaware of the opening of the Demon Crane and the restriction formation but was trying to appear to be in the know.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Father, can we go as well?&rdquo; Long Chengyu asked the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.</span><br><span>The Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief first looked at the Immemorial Star Sea before turning to Long Chengyu.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look like there&rsquo;ll be a change with the Immemorial Star Sea anytime soon, whereas the Demon Crane will only remain open for two to four hours. It shouldn&rsquo;t impede our plans. You can go in if you wish,&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.</span><br><span>The juniors were excited to hear that, especially given how well-known the Demon Crane was. They wanted to take a look inside even though they weren&rsquo;t world spiritists.</span><br><span>Long Chengyu turned to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, let&rsquo;s head in and take a look.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Mm,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>In spite of Daoist Demon Crane&rsquo;s odd behavior, there was no denying that the Demon Crane was a treasure. It should be worthwhile to pay it a visit if there were fortuitous encounters inside.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Father, are we allowed to reveal our presence here?&rdquo; Long Chengyu asked the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Of course. It&rsquo;s only out of convenience that we are concealing ourselves; we aren&rsquo;t afraid of trouble. You may reveal yourself right now if you wish to,&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief replied with a domineering tone.</span><br><span>The Totem Dragon Clan was the overlord of the Totem Dragon Galaxy, after all.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I prefer to maintain a low profile,&rdquo; Long Chengyu replied with a smile.</span><br><span>Chu Feng and the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s juniors, still in a concealed state, flew toward the Demon Crane. As expected, the invisible formation around the Demon Crane didn&rsquo;t obstruct the passageway of juniors like them, allowing them to enter without a hitch.</span><br><span>While the Demon Crane appeared to be a monstrous beast on the surface, it was no different from a remnant on the inside. Its mouth first led into a long passageway that was connected to a majestic palace filled with many closed doors.</span><br><span>There were already quite a few juniors gathered inside the palace. They were examining the area, hoping to figure out a way to open the doors, but there weren&rsquo;t any clues to be found.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, how do we open these doors?&rdquo; Long Chengyu and the other Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s juniors turned to look at Chu Feng.</span><br><span>They had grown to trust Chu Feng&rsquo;s capabilities after witnessing what he had pulled off in the God Taboo Battlefield. They thought that Chu Feng might have a solution here even though they were stumped.</span><br><span>&ldquo;There might be a quota on the number of challengers. The entrance will close once the quota is reached, and the other doors will open,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the point of this mechanism?&rdquo; a Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s junior posed his question.</span><br><span>&ldquo;This mechanism is usually implemented to ensure fairness amongst the challengers, so as to ensure that everyone is on the same starting line. There could be other reasons too, so it&rsquo;s still too early to say for sure,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>As if fulfilling a prophecy, the entrance soon closed after a few more people entered the palace. Moments later, all of the shut doors inside the palace opened up.</span><br><span>Some amongst the crowd tried to charge in.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>Tremendous pressure suddenly crashed down on the palace, sealing off all of the doors and developing the crowd. Everyone quickly turned their attention toward the source of </span><span>the pressure. There, they saw space distorting, followed by the appearance of over a thousand figures.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Heavens! Could those be&hellip;?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Shock and disbelief could be seen in the crowd&rsquo;s eyes as they began to lose their composure. Even the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s juniors revealed stunned and grim looks.</span><br><span>Those figures were dressed in exquisite and extravagant red robes that were clearly treasures. They were all extremely good-looking individuals with unique eyes and ears. A similar imprint could be seen on their foreheads.</span><br><span>It was clear from their appearances that they weren&rsquo;t humans.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Totem Phoenix Clan! They are still around? I thought that they had died out!&rdquo; a Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s junior blurted out.</span><br><span>Outsiders couldn&rsquo;t hear his voice as they were still in concealment, but Chu Feng and the others heard those words loud and clear. From the discussions around him, Chu Feng quickly gained a rough grasp of the Totem Phoenix Clan.</span><br><span>The Totem Phoenix Clan was a long-standing clan that had existed since the inception of the current era. Its name was once spoken alongside that of the Totem Dragon Clan.</span><br><span>But as time passed, the Totem Dragon Clan continued to grow stronger, whereas the Totem Phoenix Clan gradually fell into decline. As the gap between the clans continued to widen, the Totem Phoenix Clan suddenly disappeared from the face of the world one day.</span><br><span>It has been tens of thousands of years since the disappearance of the Totem Phoenix Clan now.</span><br><span>There were many rumors regarding their disappearance.</span><br><span>Some claimed that the Totem Phoenix Clan had gone into seclusion. Some asserted that the Totem Phoenix Clan had been destroyed by their enemies.</span><br><span>The fact that over a thousand Totem Phoenix Clan&rsquo;s juniors had appeared here, and most of them were decently strong, suggested that they had chosen to go into seclusion on their own accord.</span><br></p></div>
