        <h1>Chapter 5634: The Standing of the World Spiritist Immortal King</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The formation was special in the sense that it wasn&rsquo;t manifested solely out of spirit power but a material that bore some resemblance to metal and stone too. It looked like a sharp sword, but it wasn&rsquo;t a sword. It gave off an imposing air, but it didn&rsquo;t conform to anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most important of all, the formation gave off an aura that induced deference in all of the world spiritists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beneath the formation were three closed spirit formation gates with a plaque hanging above them. Written on the plaques were &lsquo;Psyche&rsquo;, &lsquo;Construction&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Breach&rsquo;. Both the plaques and their words were so small that they looked insignificant compared to the entire formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the very center of the formation were eight words that shook Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, World Spiritist Immortal King</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng knew who the World Spiritist Immortal King was. His superior ability to breach formations stemmed from his bloodline, but the power of the nine dragons stemming from the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak played a role too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak was created by the World Spiritist Immortal King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Who&rsquo;s the World Spiritist Immortal King?&rdquo; some people amidst the crowd asked in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could see how powerful the formation was, which made them realize that the World Spiritist Immortal King was a formidable person. However, they had never heard of the latter before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Shh, quieten down. You don&rsquo;t even know the World Spiritist Immortal King? You must be tired of living!&rdquo; Those people were immediately silenced by those around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most people had heard about the World Spiritist Immortal King, and some of them began sharing his story to the others. The content of their stories were mostly similar, so Chu Feng figured that their stories were most likely accurate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just that he didn&rsquo;t expect the World Spiritist Immortal King to be so formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He should have become the Seven Realm Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master, but he turned down the position because he valued his freedom. Nevertheless, he declared that he would nurture the next mansion master for the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked ten people in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion and took them as his personal disciple. One of them, Jie Tianran, became the incumbent Seven Realms </span><span>Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master. The other nine became extraordinary individuals too, but eight of them lost their lives in a huge battle that happened in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only two of the World Spiritist Immortal King&rsquo;s disciples remained. One was Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master Jie Tianran, and the other one was Daoist Starseizer, who specialized in prophecies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daoist Starseizer had long left the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion due to ideological differences with Jie Tianran.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These showed how formidable the World Spiritist Immortal King was. Someone who had the capability to become the mansion master himself and nurture the next mansion master couldn&rsquo;t possibly be weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just that the World Spiritist Immortal King left the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion thirty thousand years ago to wander the world, and he hadn&rsquo;t returned till this day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were many speculations about his absence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some believed that the World Spiritist Immortal King was thoroughly enjoying his freedom now that his disciple was holding the fort in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. Perhaps, he might have even entered the Immemorial Domain of Gods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were also those who believed that the World Spiritist Immortal King had already returned, just that it wasn&rsquo;t announced to the rest of the world. Some went as far as to postulate that he had made a breakthrough to become a Heavenly Dragon World Spiritist, making him the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s greatest backing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus far, the World Spiritist Immortal King had disappeared from public sight for thirty thousand years now. More formidable prodigies such as Jie Mubai, Jie Tiannian, and Jie Ranqing had appeared in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, but the World Spiritist Immortal King remained nowhere to be seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>I never thought Elder World Spiritist Immortal King would be so formidable. Would he become my enemy if I declare war against the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion in the future?&rdquo; Chu Feng wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to bring down anyone who stood in the way of his vengeance, but the World Spiritist Immortal King had helped him greatly over the years. In particular, the aid he had received from the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak was cumulative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If there was a choice, he didn&rsquo;t want to make enemies with the World Spiritist Immortal King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weng!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a glowing mark suddenly appeared at the very top of the humongous formation, above the name of the World Spiritist Immortal King. It was a massive and ancient mark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>That mark is&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had received the same mark on his palm when he grasped the power of the nine dragons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, when he first obtained the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak, the World Spiritist Immortal King&rsquo;s projection told him that as long as he mastered the Nine Dragons God Cloak, a mark would appear on his palm. As long as he had this mark on his </span><span>palm, he could freely enter and leave the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>What&rsquo;s that? It feels divine.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>I feel like my soul is being enlightened just by looking at that mark. It feels wondrous.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most looked at the ancient mark with intrigued eyes, but there were also a few knowledgeable people in the crowd who recognized the mark and explained its significance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The World Spiritist Immortal King had once declared that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion would fall into decline if it went into isolation, and that it would have to take in new blood to maintain or even further its greatness. He said that he would find talents in his travels, though he didn&rsquo;t know when these talents would surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the World Spiritist Immortal King left the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, he constructed this humongous formation in the Spring Upper Realm. This humongous formation consisted of three trials&mdash;psyche, formation construction, and formation breaching. Anyone who achieved the highest grade in these three trials would receive the mark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the World Spiritist Immortal King left, all of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s powerful elders and prodigious juniors challenged the formation, but none of them succeeded in receiving the mark. Even Jie Mubai and Jie Tiannian had failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had visited the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion with the mark in the past thirty thousand years either. Many concluded that this was simply the World Spiritist Immortal King&rsquo;s prank, and it was impossible to obtain the mark at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or at least that was the case until one person proved them wrong&mdash;Jie Ranqing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To this day, she was the only one who had obtained the mark. She proved to the world that it was possible to obtain the mark from the World Spiritist Immortal King&rsquo;s formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>There&rsquo;s such significance behind the mark?&rdquo; Chu Feng clenched his fist in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that as long as he had this mark, he could enter the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion without participating in the entrance examination.</span></p></div>
