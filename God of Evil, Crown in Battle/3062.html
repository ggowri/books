        <div> - Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;That is also what this junior is thinking. Thus, this junior has decided to first make a breakthrough in cultivation. After I become a rank five Heavenly Immortal, I will then properly comprehend the martial comprehension in this bracelet.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will see if I&rsquo;m able to obtain enough comprehension from this bracelet to breakthrough to rank six Heavenly Immortal.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If this junior is capable of making a breakthrough to rank six Heavenly Immortal, even if the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations are to come after me, this junior will not fear them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Merely, if I am to do that, I&rsquo;m afraid that I might not be able to make it in time for the Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You might as well. The outcome of the Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition is simply of no importance to the current you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, none of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s younger generations possess the qualifications to contend against you. Right now, your true opponents are the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations,&rdquo; Chu Youyuan said.<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>Chu Feng also knew that participation in the Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition was already meaningless. The reason for that was because his cultivation was obvious. As long as someone saw his cultivation, they would immediately know that he was stronger than all of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>Moreover, the reason why Chu Feng wanted to participate in the Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition back then was because he had wanted to prove himself to the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Right now, Chu Feng no longer needed to prove himself through the Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition. Instead, what he needed to do was to obtain justice from the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Chu Feng needed to increase his cultivation not only for the sake of taking on the Li Heavenly Clan, but also to take on the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>If his cultivation was truly capable of reaching rank six Heavenly Immortal, the Chu Heavenly Clan would have to earnestly consider if they wanted to really make things difficult for him.<br>After all, a talent like that should be nurtured, not strangled.<br>Afterwards, Chu Feng entered closed-door training.<br>He had already comprehended sufficient comprehension to make a breakthrough to rank five Heavenly Immortal.<br>Furthermore, although the power of the Divine Tribulation was very powerful, Chu Feng had gradually adapted to it. Thus, Chu Feng quickly reached a breakthrough from rank four Heavenly Immortal to rank five Heavenly Immortal.<br>After that, Chu Feng started to comprehend the martial comprehension on the Metamorphosis Mysteryrealm Bracelet.<br>The martial comprehension on the Metamorphosis Mysteryrealm Bracelet was something that one needed to spend time comprehending. Furthermore, it was very difficult to comprehend. Thus, it took Chu Feng some time to comprehend it.<br>That being said, Chu Feng still managed to successfully comprehend a portion of the martial comprehension. However, merely that portion of martial comprehension was sufficient to allow Chu Feng to successfully make a breakthrough from rank five Heavenly Immortal to rank six Heavenly Immortal.<br>That said, Chu Feng was not satisfied with only this. The reason for that was because he had only comprehended a portion of the martial comprehension contained in the bracelet. Contained within the flickering lights of the Metamorphosis Mysteryrealm Bracelet was more martial comprehension. If Chu Feng could continue to comprehend it, he would be able to make another breakthrough in cultivation.<br>Unfortunately, Chu Feng&rsquo;s wish was not fulfilled this time.<br>The martial comprehension within the Metamorphosis Mysteryrealm Bracelet was now even more difficult to comprehend. Chu Feng spent ten days attempting to comprehend the remaining martial comprehension to no avail. In the end, Chu Feng decided to give up.<br>Chu Feng decided to proceed for the Chu Heavenly Clan and retrieve justice for himself.<br>&ldquo;Seniors, our journey this time will be very dangerous. If you two insist on traveling with us, you should enter the hideout,&rdquo; Chu Feng took out the Bandit Beasts&rsquo; hideout.<br>Chu Feng had gained control over the hideout. In essence, Chu Feng was carrying a little world with him now.<br>As for Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi, they had learned of what had happened to Chu Feng, and were determined to journey together with him.<br>Fearing accidents, Chu Feng wanted Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi to hide in the hideout for their own safety.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, if you are to do this, you&rsquo;ll be looking down on me, your big brother.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Does your big brother and big sister Xunyi look like people that fear death?&rdquo; Ying Mingchao revealed a somewhat displeased expression toward Chu Feng&rsquo;s proposal.<br>He naturally knew that Chu Feng was considering his safety. However, who was Ying Mingchao?<br>Although his current cultivation might be among the bottom tier in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, he remained the hero of an era.<br>Contained within Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s bones was toughness and unyieldingness that ordinary people did not possess.<br>He had decided to journey together with Chu Feng precisely because he wanted to share Chu Feng&rsquo;s trials and tribulations.<br>It would naturally be best if Chu Feng could obtain justice. However, if he could not, Ying Mingchao was determined to curse out the Chu Heavenly Clan and die together with Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Senior, that was not my intention. I merely&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng still wanted to persuade Ying Mingchao. He truly did not want Ying Mingchao to encounter dangers because of him.<br>However, right at that moment, Chu Youyuan waved his hand and said to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Chu Feng, there&rsquo;s no need for you to act like this. On this journey, not only will I obtain justice for you, but I will also guarantee your safety.&rdquo;<br>Chu Youyuan had a faint smile on his face when he said those words.<br>Seeing that smile, Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart moved. He felt that it was not an ordinary smile. Instead, it was a smile of absolute confidence.<br>Chu Youyuan was confident in himself.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng no longer attempted to say anything anymore. He retrieved the Bandit Beasts&rsquo; hideout and put it back in his Cosmos Sack.<br>Then, he smiled lightly and said, &ldquo;Actually, it is also my wish for the four of us to journey together.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Haha, that&rsquo;s more like it. It&rsquo;s more interesting for us to journey together,&rdquo; Ying Mingchao laughed heartily.<br>Then, Chu Feng and the others proceeded toward the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>When Chu Feng and the others arrived at the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s entrance, they discovered that the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s entrance was covered with martial cultivators, filling both the sky and the ground. It was bustling with even greater noise and excitement than before.<br>Furthermore, people from the Starfall Holy Land, the Paradise Valley, the Dao Imperial Palace, the Ghost Sect Hall and the various other major powers were all present.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that the Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition has been postponed for some reason.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, we have arrived at the perfect timing. We managed to catch up to the Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is the perfect opportunity. Today, this old man will obtain justice for you before all of the heroes of our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm,&rdquo; Chu Youyuan said to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I will have to trouble senior then,&rdquo; Chu Feng clasped his fist toward Chu Youyuan.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go. It&rsquo;s time for them to pay the price,&rdquo; as Chu Youyuan spoke, he brought Chu Feng, Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi and proceeded to fly toward the direction where the Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition was being held.<br>An island was currently floating in the sky. That island was a formation. It was the location where the Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition was being held.<br>On the Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition&rsquo;s main viewing platform, practically all of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s experts, with the exception of their Clan Chief, were present.<br>Naturally, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elders were also present.<br>Both Chu Zhiyuan and Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather were present on the stage. Those two despicable men currently had joyous smiles on their faces. It seemed that their moods were extremely good.<br>The Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Ruler, the Paradise Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master and the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master were also present on the main viewing platform. Although the Dao Imperial Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master was not present, the Dao Imperial Palace&rsquo;s many experts were all present.<br>It could be said that the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s peak experts were all gathered on the main viewing platform. It was truly a spectacular sight, something one could boast of for the rest of one&rsquo;s life should one be able to see it.<br>However, even though all those grand characters were present, none of them were sitting in the master seat.<br>Sitting in the master seat was an unfamiliar face.<br></p></div>
