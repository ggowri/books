        <div><span>: Let Me Have a Taste of Your Imperial Might</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>The young man&rsquo;s strength was the real deal even though he had a screw loose. Thinking that the young man might know a thing or two about this place, Chu Feng chased after him, only to find that he couldn&rsquo;t catch up with the young man.</span><br><span>That further verified Chu Feng&rsquo;s guess that the young man was stronger than him.</span><br><span>For the time being, Chu Feng decided to turn his attention toward finding the clues for the formation deciphering method. He soon compiled the full formation deciphering method and proceeded into constructing the formation.</span><br><span>As soon as the formation was completed, the underground labyrinth began to shake. A surge of teleportation energy enveloped the underground labyrinth.</span><br><span>Chu Feng was teleported into a huge hall with two spirit formation gates.</span><br><span>One of the spirit formation gates was the word &lsquo;Advance&rsquo;, whereas the other had the word &lsquo;Retreat&rsquo;. The meanings behind these spirit formation gates were clear.</span><br><span>Weng!</span><br><span>Just then, another surge of teleportation energy manifested beside Chu Feng. It was the young man whom he had met earlier.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Oh? How did you get here?&rdquo; The young man stared at Chu Feng in bewilderment.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s thanks to me that you&rsquo;re able to get here,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Oh hoh! You sure are a braggart. You&rsquo;ll feel ashamed for saying those words when you finally find out who I am,&rdquo; the young man said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Then shouldn&rsquo;t you tell me who you are and why you are here?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You want to know? I shan&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; the young man said before making his way over to the &lsquo;Advance&rsquo; spirit formation gate.</span><br><span>Chu Feng keenly noticed that the young man had scanned the surroundings before </span><span>making a move, which suggested that it was his first time here too. It would appear that the young man wasn&rsquo;t a local here.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;re here, but this remnant is extremely dangerous. I suggest you think twice before making a move,&rsquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What a surprise. You&rsquo;re kinder than I thought. You might be saying those words out of goodwill, but you would have known that there's no need to if you know who I am. My strength surpasses your wildest imagination. No one else in the world of cultivation will be able to clear this remnant if I am unable to. Besides, I can&rsquo;t back off now. Someone is waiting to be saved.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Rather, I think that you should retreat here. This remnant is not a place for the weak. No matter what reasons you have to be here, you should cherish your life. Go home and accompany your family members,&rdquo; the young man said before stepping into the &lsquo;Advance&rsquo; spirit formation gate.</span><br><span>Chu Feng followed the young man into the &lsquo;Advance&rsquo; spirit formation gate. He wanted to continue interacting with the young man to gather more information from him. To his dismay, he didn&rsquo;t see the young man on the other side of the spirit formation gate.</span><br><span>He had entered an independent spatial realm suffused with the aura of the Ancient Era. This suggested that they would be facing the next trial separately.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That fellow said that he&rsquo;s here to save someone. Could it be that he has a family member or a friend who is inflicted with the curse?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s possible,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>All of a sudden, the spatial realm expanded and became unbelievably huge, to the extent that it felt like even the vast world of cultivation could only be this big. However, the space remained pitch-black and empty. Not a single realm could be seen.</span><br><span>Just standing in this void was enough to make one feel incomparably small. Even if Chu Feng regained his cultivation, he didn&rsquo;t think that he could ever fly to the edge of this spatial realm.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Eggy, this remnant is much more formidable than we have imagined,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I noticed that too. I can hardly imagine the amount of energy required to create a spatial realm of this size. The owner of this remnant must have been a powerhouse back in the Ancient Era,&rdquo; Eggy said.</span><br><span>She could sense how powerful the spatial realm was even through Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes.</span><br><span>Weng!</span><br><span>A small bundle of red aura suddenly surfaced from the depths of the spatial realm, and it was swiftly growing bigger. To be exact, the bundle wasn&rsquo;t expanding. It was already colossal as it was, just that it had been too far away to perceive its size. But now, it was quickly closing in on Chu Feng.</span><br><span>Chu Feng&rsquo;s breathing hastened.</span><br><span>While he had mentally prepared himself for it, he still felt pressured by the approach of red aura. Its sheer size spanned an entire starfield, and the energy it harnessed was </span><span>enough to blow up a starfield too.</span><br><span>The red aura wasn&rsquo;t releasing the slightest bit of oppressive might, but Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t doubt the destructive potential of the red aura at all. To make things worse, his cultivation was sealed, which meant that even the slightest whiff of it could obliterate him.</span><br><span>It was doubtful whether even the protective formation his father had left in him could protect him. That was how terrifying the red aura was.</span><br><span>Weng!</span><br><span>Much to Chu Feng&rsquo;s bewilderment, a spirit formation gate leading back to the hall suddenly appeared behind him.</span><br><span>Following that, a deep and resonant feminine voice echoed throughout the entire realm, &ldquo;Those who wish to venture deeper into my imperial might have to prove themselves qualified by withstanding my imperial might. Only those who are truly capable will survive this trial. Ordinary mortals should think twice before proceeding. If you know your own limits, turn around and leave. There&rsquo;ll be no retreat for those who insist on marching ahead.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>The bundle of red aura began charging at Chu Feng while suffusing the entire spatial realm. Chu Feng realized that he had still been underestimating the red aura; the destructive prowess it harnessed might be sufficient to destroy even an entire galaxy!</span><br><span>&ldquo;Run, Chu Feng!&rdquo; Eggy urged.</span><br><span>The red aura charging at them was so powerful that there was no way Chu Feng could withstand it.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Trust me, Eggy,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>Instead of turning around, he took a step forward. As if acknowledging his decision, the spirit formation gate behind him dissipated. His path of retreat had been sealed. Even so, Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t panicked in the least. A smile formed on his lips.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Imperial might? I was also once an emperor in a Lower Realm. I don&rsquo;t know whether I am qualified or not, but all I have is my courage. Elder, it&rsquo;s a stroke of fate that I was able to meet you here today. I&rsquo;d find it a huge regret if I leave just like that. Allow me to have a taste of your imperial might,&rdquo; Chu Feng said before dashing toward the voice.</span><br><span>At the same time, the red aura crashed down on Chu Feng from all directions. This was a force more than enough to vaporize his entire body!</span><br></p></div>
