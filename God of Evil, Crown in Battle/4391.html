        <h1>Chapter 4390</h1>
        <div>: Your Life Is Mine To Take<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster was taken aback. He fell into a state of bewilderment.<br>What he had just heard was too astonishing for him to accept in the spur of a moment.<br>&ldquo;Sectmaster, he&rsquo;s the one! He&rsquo;s the one that we have been talking about!&rdquo; the crowd from the Soaring Flower Gazebo exclaimed in agitation.<br>&ldquo;Are you certain?&rdquo; the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster asked doubtfully.<br>&ldquo;Sectmaster, we&rsquo;re certain about it! His name is Chu Feng, and he&rsquo;s the one who did all of it!&rdquo;<br>The guest elder, Supreme Elder, and the others of the Soaring Flower Gazebo spoke affirmatively.<br>&ldquo;You beast!!!&rdquo;<br>In the next moment, the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster turned to Chu Feng and bellowed furiously.<br>He had always been known to be a composed person, but at this very moment, his face had turned livid with rage. His jaws were tightly clenched together, and even veins were popping out of his face.<br>He couldn&rsquo;t have imagined how someone who had just committed such atrocities to his Soaring Flower Gazebo would dare to come here to challenge his First Personal Disciple, Zhao Xuanhe, right away, and even bet his life with him!<br>Like a ferocious inferno, his rage couldn&rsquo;t be quelled anymore.<br>How could he tolerate such preposterousness?<br>Just how much did that young lad look down on their Soaring Flower Gazebo to dare pull something like this on them?<br>&ldquo;Sectmaster Xu, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;<br>The crowd was confused by the sudden outburst from the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster, so a few people began inquiring into the situation.<br>&ldquo;That beast over there, he stole the treasure of our Soaring Flower Gazebo and killed my disciples. That guest elder over there was nearly assimilated to his death by him. The current state of my disciples is his doing!&rdquo; the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster bellowed furiously. He pointed to the guest elder, Li Rui, Ma Chengying, and the others to prove that he wasn&rsquo;t lying.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Those words really surprised everyone in the room.<br>&ldquo;That young friend over there, did you really do all of that?&rdquo; someone amidst the crowd asked Chu Feng.<br>Everything they had just heard sounded too ridiculous to be true.<br>A junior actually did all of that?<br>Even if a junior was able to do all of that, why in the world would he come here right after and challenge Zhao Xuanhe, even betting their lives on the line for that?<br>Just how audacious must one be to do something like that?<br>They couldn&rsquo;t even imagine it in their heads.<br>&ldquo;Sigh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a little helpless upon seeing this situation. He had known that it was a matter of time before the Soaring Flower Gazebo caught onto him, but he didn&rsquo;t expect it to happen so abruptly.<br>Why in the world did they have to appear at this juncture? This really put him at a spot.<br>&ldquo;Take the treasure, and I&rsquo;ll ensure your safety,&rdquo; a voice suddenly sounded in Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears at this moment.<br>Upon hearing the voice, a spark of glee broke out in Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart, and a slight smile formed on his face.<br>It was the voice of the expert he had met by the lakeside earlier.<br>It was under the other party&rsquo;s instruction that he came here to challenge Zhao Xuanhe so as to lay claim to the prize prepared by the Sagacious Grandmaster.<br>With that expert backing him, there was no need for him to fear the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster anymore.<br>&ldquo;Yes, I was the one who did it,&rdquo; Chu Feng admitted to it frankly.<br>It was as if an explosion broke out in the room in the next moment.<br>Putting aside the others, even Liu Shangwu was shocked too.<br>He didn&rsquo;t think that Chu Feng would do something like this before coming here.<br>&ldquo;You beast! You are inhuman! Why would you steal my treasure and kill the disciples of my sect for no reason? I want you to pay for what you did with your life!&rdquo; the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster roared.<br>He thrust his fist forward to suppress Chu Feng with his overpowering martial power.<br>Due to the massive gap in prowess, Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t even discern just how powerful the attack was. All he could feel was death charging right in his direction, threatening to reap him away.<br>Boom!<br>Chu Feng suddenly felt his surroundings jolting violently, but for some reason, he was completely unharmed.<br>Something had blocked the attack. It was the barrier around the dueling ring that was put up when the earlier duel began.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, you!!!!&rdquo; the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster turned to look at the Sagacious Grandmaster in shock.<br>He knew that it was the Sagacious Grandmaster who had blocked his attack.<br>&ldquo;The result of the tournament isn&rsquo;t out yet. Who permitted you to fight here?&rdquo; the Sagacious Grandmaster looked at the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster with a hint of rage in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, that fellow is a reprehensible villain! Am I not justified to kill him?&rdquo; the aggrieved Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster asked.<br>&ldquo;You can settle your own grudge privately. However, I am the overseer of the world spiritist tournament, and I won&rsquo;t allow you to fool around with it!&rdquo; the Sagacious Grandmaster replied.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Everyone was a little taken aback by the situation.<br>In truth, they had faced a similar situation before. The Sagacious Grandmaster was extremely strict on anyone who tried to interfere with the proceedings of the tournament.<br>However, the situation was different from before. After all, Chu Feng had admitted to his crimes himself.<br>Even as spectators, they couldn&rsquo;t stand the sight of a villain like that gloating over his deeds. If they could, they would have charged forward themselves to cut down Chu Feng&rsquo;s head.<br>So, they couldn&rsquo;t accept how the Sagacious Grandmaster was still so obstinate in upholding his rules.<br>That being said, even if they thought that the Sagacious Grandmaster was wrong, none of them would dare to refute him out of fear of offending him.<br>Shoosh!<br>It was at this moment that a figure suddenly leaped into the air. It was Zhao Xuanhe.<br>Realizing that the situation was disadvantageous to him, he tried to escape from the dueling ring so as to get away from Chu Feng and head to the side of his master.<br>Uwa!<br>But barely after he rose to the air, another figure rose up and knocked him back to the ground.<br>It was Chu Feng!<br>&ldquo;Zhao Xuanhe, where do you think you are going?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked as he gazed down on Zhao Xuanhe with a cold smirk.<br>&ldquo;Sagacious Grandmaster, I admit defeat. I&rsquo;ll surrender!&rdquo; Zhao Xuanhe shouted loudly.<br>However, the Sagacious Grandmaster didn&rsquo;t respond.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, Xuanhe has already admitted defeat. Hurry up and release the seal!&rdquo; the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster also quickly spoke up too.<br>The Sagacious Grandmaster still remained silent, not saying a word at all. This really put everyone from the Soaring Flower Gazebo into a panic.<br>They had a good idea what Chu Feng was going to do next, especially since Zhao Xuanhe and Chu Feng had betted their lives on the battle earlier.<br>&ldquo;Zhao Xuanhe, you&rsquo;re admitting defeat? Since that&rsquo;s the case, I&rsquo;ll need you to fulfill the end of your promise too. Your life will be forfeited to me then.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng clenched his right hand into a fist, and a spirit formation sword materialized in his grasp. He raised his hand, and the spirit formation sword followed his movements.<br>Puchi!<br>As the sword was pulled down, Zhao Xuanhe&rsquo;s head was severed from his neck.<br>&ldquo;NOOO!!!&rdquo;<br>The Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster let loose a despairing howl upon seeing this sight.<br>That was his beloved disciple, and yet, the latter actually died right before his eyes.<br>It was something that he could have never imagined to be possible, but it was happening right before him!<br>&ldquo;Regardless of whether you believe it or not, those from the Soaring Flower Gazebo have been committing all kinds of atrocities. I, Chu Feng, am just exacting justice for the countless victims whom they have harmed under their hypocritical exterior,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to the crowd after slaying Zhao Xuanhe.<br>&ldquo;What are you talking about? The Soaring Flower Gazebo is a righteous sect, so how could they possibly have committed atrocities?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You are the one committing atrocities here, stop pinning the blame on others!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You stole the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s treasure and killed their disciples, and now, you are still trying to slander them? How could someone as young as you have such a vicious heart?&rdquo;<br>However, there was no one here who believed in Chu Feng at all. Instead, the criticisms directed toward Chu Feng only worsened.<br>Even the Eight Immortal Swordswomen of the Dao Sea were heaping criticisms on Chu Feng too.<br>&ldquo;How foolish.&rdquo;<br>Facing such a situation, Chu Feng simply shook his head in resignation. He only thought that these people were too fixated with appearances to see what lay beneath.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill you!!!&rdquo;<br>All of a sudden, a furious howl sounded, and a burst of devastating might filled with killing intent and martial power swept toward Chu Feng.<br>It was the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster making a move once more.<br>Boom!<br>His attack was even stronger than before, but the outcome was still the same.<br>It was blocked by the barrier around the dueling ring once again.<br></p></div>
