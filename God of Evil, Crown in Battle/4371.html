        <h1>Chapter 4370</h1>
        <div>: A Little Bizarre<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Bloodmist Heaven Exalted, it&rsquo;s no wonder why you seemed to always be able to move before others did prior to entering the remnant. With such a treasure with you, it would be weird if you weren&rsquo;t able to outdo your other competitors.&rdquo;<br>The more Chu Feng came to understand the prowess of the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk, the more impressed he was with its prowess.<br>With such a treasure in hand, it felt like any problems that he faced regarding formations could be resolved easily.<br>It felt like his own mastery of world spiritist techniques wasn&rsquo;t that important anymore since the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk seemed to be able to do anything he wished.<br>As for the guest elder, he was completely oblivious that someone was siphoning power from the main formation, and neither did he notice that his control over the formation was gradually reducing.<br>Nevertheless, that didn&rsquo;t hinder him from being in a terrible mood as he bellowed, &ldquo;Goddamnit, why is it still not working?! Those bunch of useless trash! I told them to aid the formation, but they aren&rsquo;t helping at all. A bunch of good-for-nothings!&rdquo;<br>But after venting his rage, he began muttering contemplatively to himself, &ldquo;Why is it still not getting through? What am I lacking?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That old thing sure is a perfectionist,&rdquo; Chu Feng thought to himself from the shadows.<br>Due to him siphoning power from the main formation, he was able to sense the power that the guest elder was controlling. It was a vast power that encompassed this entire mountain range.<br>Because of this, he could understand why the guest elder was in a horrible mood.<br>All of the elders and disciples of the Soaring Flower Gazebo were working together to drive the formation, hoping to bring the might of the formation to a higher level so that it would be able to aid in the assimilation of the treasure.<br>But unfortunately, it seemed like the energy provided by those elders and disciples made nary a difference at all. It was not because the amount of energy they were providing was lacking though.<br>In truth, the involvement of the elders and the disciples was an excessive move. It didn&rsquo;t tackle the crux of the assimilation of the treasure.<br>Everything needed to assimilate the treasure was already in the formation, but the treasure still remained yet to be assimilated seemingly due to the lack of a critical element.<br>As for what that lacking critical element was, neither the guest elder nor Chu Feng was able to figure out what it was.<br>That being said, Chu Feng welcomed this sight with glee.<br>While the treasure hadn&rsquo;t fully matured yet, it had already taken form. With just a glance, he could tell that it was no ordinary item.<br>It was an extremely rare treasure that aided one&rsquo;s cultivation, and its value only went further up after all of the efforts the Soaring Flower Gazebo put into preparing it. Without a doubt, its value was beyond imagination.<br>Most cultivation-related treasures would provide a cultivator with the energy of the world and create an impetus for him to make a breakthrough. These treasures increased the probability of making a breakthrough, but in the end, the cultivator still had to depend on himself.<br>Take Chu Feng for example, even if he were to make a breakthrough, he still had to endure the power of the Divine Lightning in order to make a breakthrough.<br>However, the treasure inside the copper cauldron was something that would allow one to overcome all obstacles.<br>If Chu Feng were to assimilate it, he wouldn&rsquo;t have to undergo the Divine Lightning Tribulation in order to make a breakthrough.<br>To put it in other words, it was like a mystical pill that could increase one&rsquo;s cultivation unconditionally once consumed, and it was a significant increase at that.<br>Based on what Chu Feng had seen thus far, the energy in the treasure should be more than enough for him to make two consecutive breakthroughs.<br>&ldquo;It stopped?&rdquo; Chu Feng thought in surprise as he glanced at the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk in his hands.<br>He was still driving the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk with his spirit energy, but it had already retracted its energy at this moment, such that it was no longer siphoning energy from the main formation anymore.<br>&ldquo;Is this the limit?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng tried to activate the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk once more, but it wasn&rsquo;t reacting anymore.<br>Despite so, he didn&rsquo;t keep the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk back in. Instead, he continued to hold it tightly in his hands.<br>While Chu Feng had already gained control over a part of the main formation, he still didn&rsquo;t have the absolute confidence to subdue the guest elder.<br>He felt that as long as he were to hold the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk in his hand, it might just help him during a critical moment.<br>Awooooooooo!<br>All of a sudden, the cries of agony all around grew even sharper.<br>Upon seeing that the assimilation of the treasure was nearing success, the guest elder began to frenziedly extract the blood power from the various living beings in the formation.<br>At this rate, it was only a matter of time before all of them died.<br>&ldquo;That fellow is really insane!&rdquo;<br>Even Chu Feng could tell that even if the guest elder were to suck their blood dry, he still wouldn&rsquo;t be able to successfully assimilate the treasure, so the guest elder should be able to tell the same too. Yet, he still chose to go ahead with such an action.<br>Chu Feng was initially intending to wait it out a little longer to assess the situation, but he couldn&rsquo;t bear to see so many people dying in vain. So, he decided to make a move right now.<br>Boom!<br>Chu Feng tapped into the great amount of power he had siphoned away from the main formation and directed them toward the guest elder like the eruption of a volcano.<br>&ldquo;This is?&rdquo;<br>However, the guest elder also reacted swiftly to Chu Feng&rsquo;s offense.<br>Before the burst of power could come close to him, he had already controlled the power of the main formation to deflect Chu Feng&rsquo;s attack.<br>&ldquo;Your reaction is not too bad,&rdquo; Chu Feng remarked as he showed himself.<br>There was no point hiding anymore since he had already exposed himself from the moment he began tapping into the power of the main formation.<br>&ldquo;Who are you? How are you able to control the energy of this formation?&rdquo;<br>The guest elder was surprised to see Chu Feng. His eyes narrowed coldly as he quickly assessed the latter from head-to-toe warily.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to know who I am,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied as he began controlling the power of the formation once more.<br>This time, the ground rumbled and mountains shattered.<br>Chu Feng was drawing a far greater amount of power from the formation this time around, such that it was almost comparable to the strength of a Martial Exalted level cultivator.<br>&ldquo;I see. You siphoned energy from the main formation. However, you are looking down on me too much!&rdquo;<br>The guest elder appeared to be no ordinary world spiritist either.<br>He was able to tell right away that Chu Feng had stolen part of the control over the main formation from him while he was distracted, and he was able to easily control the massive amount of energy within the formation to block off Chu Feng&rsquo;s attack too.<br>&ldquo;Those bunch of good-for-nothings actually allowed a rat to scamper all the way in here. Useless fools, they don&rsquo;t deserve to exist on the face of the world at all!&rdquo; the guest elder cursed coldly.<br>But even as he cursed, he was still driving the formation adeptly.<br>Shockingly, he was able to control the power of the formation to hasten the maturity of the treasure while channeling a part of its powers to attack Chu Feng.<br>Furthermore, the power that the guest elder drew from the formation was actually greater than that of Chu Feng, causing the latter to quickly fall into a disadvantageous position.<br>The amount of energy Chu Feng had siphoned away from the main formation was more than half, so he should have been able to win in a direct clash of powers, but somehow, he still found himself struggling to match against the guest elder!<br></p></div>
