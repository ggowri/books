        <div> - The Appearance Of The Black-feathered Specter<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Laughter?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you must&rsquo;ve misheard it. That was clearly a scream of pain,&rdquo; said a Tantai Heavenly Clan elder.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right after his words left his mouth, the ground started to tremble violently, and the ear-piercing screams grew even more resounding.<br>In the next moment, screams and anguished wails began to sound from all over the Tantai Heavenly Clan.<br>Although they were already prepared for the retaliation of the Black-feathered Specter, they had not expected its attack to spread throughout the entire Tantai Heavenly Clan.<br>For the people that were not hiding in the spirit formation, those with weak cultivations found themselves bleeding from all seven facial orifices. In more serious cases, they ended up losing consciousness. In the most serious cases, they exploded and died.<br>&ldquo;This thing, it&rsquo;s trying to resist!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s elders realized that they had underestimated the power of the Black-feathered Specter.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, the symbols and runes on the grand demon suppression formation started to flow straight into the beam of light like a magnificent army of thousands of men and horses.<br>When that happened, the screams of the Black-feathered Specter grew weaker and weaker, and soon completely disappeared.<br>&ldquo;Captured! Young friend Chu Feng, it would appear that you had truly misheard it,&rdquo; there was a deep sense of mockery in the eyes of the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s elders as they looked to Chu Feng.<br>However, Chu Feng felt he had not misheard things. He truly felt that the voice had sounded more like laughter.<br>That said, that grand demon suppression formation did indeed manage to capture the Black-feathered Specter.<br>After the Black-feathered Specter was suppressed, the grand demon suppression formation that had sealed off the entire Tantai Heavenly Clan started to disperse. That said, it was still in operation. It directly teleported that Black-feathered Specter before Chu Feng and the others.<br>After the Black-feathered Specter was brought over, the enormous title plate on the formation core turned into a spirit formation rope and completely tied up the Black-feathered Specter.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng and the others were able to see the true appearance of the Black-feathered Specter that had been tormenting the Tantai Heavenly Clan for ten thousand years.<br>It had a humanoid appearance, yet its size was enormous. It measured over fifty meters tall.<br>Its entire body was covered in black feathers. The black feathers on its body were exactly the same as the black feathers Chu Feng and the others had discovered before.<br>Thus, to be exact, it was not a giant. Instead, it was a giant-sized monster.<br>Even though the Black-feathered Specter was already restrained, it was still emitting overflowing killing intent, and appeared very vicious. It was as if it were an evil embodiment of grievance.<br>Because of that, the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s elders immediately backed away, backed all the way to the entrance of the palace that served as the formation core, upon seeing it. They wished that they could break through the palace gates and into the palace itself.<br>It was instead Wuming Xingyun who began to carefully size up the Black-feathered Specter.<br>Chu Feng, on the other hand, was even more bold. He actually took several steps forward and released his spirit power to form an image of Bai Liluo.<br>&ldquo;Have you encountered this young lady before?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked as he pointed to Bai Liluo&rsquo;s image.<br>However, the Black-feathered Specter did not answer him. It only let out a growl.<br>Chu Feng frowned. He didn&rsquo;t know how to handle this Black-feathered Specter.<br>He was able to tell that the monster before him possessed extraordinary power. It was most definitely not something that the current him could handle.<br>Martial power would definitely be useless against it. Apart from martial power, what could he do?<br>Use spirit power against it?<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>A burst of loud noises sounded. The gate of the formation core behind Chu Feng and the others began to open. The Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and two Supreme Elders walked out from it.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, quickly, kill this monster to avenge our seniors.&rdquo;<br>After seeing the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, the elders all spoke to him.<br>They were all itching to eliminate the Black-feathered Specter. However, rather than trying to avenge their clansmen, it would be more accurate to say that they were afraid of the Black-feathered Specter, and wanted to immediately eliminate the danger.<br>&ldquo;We still don't know the whereabouts of young lady Bai Liluo. Before figuring that out, we still cannot kill it,&rdquo; the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed upon hearing those words. He did not expect that the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief would not immediately kill the Black-feathered Specter because of Bai Liluo.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, this&hellip;&rdquo; The Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s elders were all surprised to hear their clan chief&rsquo;s words.<br>&ldquo;That young lady has disappeared in our clan. We must shoulder the responsibility for her disappearance. My decision has already been made. You don't have to speak anymore,&rdquo; the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief spoke firmly.<br>In such a situation, even though those elders were unable to understand their clan chief&rsquo;s decision, they did not dare to say anything anymore.<br>The Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief pointed to Bai Liluo&rsquo;s image as he asked the Black-feathered Specter, &ldquo;This young lady is not a clansman of our clan. You shouldn&rsquo;t have killed her, right?&rdquo;<br>However, the Black-feathered Specter still did not respond.<br>That said, the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was confident, even though he was faced with such behavior from the Black-feathered Specter. He turned to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, I have a way to handle it.&rdquo;<br>Then, the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief began to use the grand demon suppression formation to torture the Black-feathered Specter. The crowd were able to sense that the Black-feathered Specter was undergoing immense pain.<br>However, it did not let out any screams of pain. It merely continued to let out low growls.<br>Furthermore, it also did not say a single word.<br>This caused Chu Feng to feel completely helpless. Although he did not know why, he had a feeling, a premonition, that Bai Liluo was still alive.<br>That said, premonitions were not things that one could rely on. Besides, her disappearance was related to the terrifying being before him.<br>Thus, Chu Feng truly wanted to find some traces of Bai Liluo. Otherwise, he would not be able to feel at ease.<br>Yet, the current situation had reached a deadlock.<br>Strangely, although the Black-feathered Specter did not say anything, the premonition that Chu Feng had that Bai Liluo was still alive grew stronger and stronger.<br>Although he was unwilling to admit it, this intense premonition of Bai Liluo still being alive had eased his worry-filled heart.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, Lord Xingyun, I will increase the power of the grand demon suppression formation. However, a certain amount of time is needed to prepare it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, young friend Chu Feng, please rest assured. I will definitely be able to make it speak the whereabouts of young lady Bai Liluo. Regardless of whether she&rsquo;s dead or alive, I will give you an answer,&rdquo; the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;I will trouble senior then,&rdquo; Chu Feng bowed, and then left the formation core with Wuming Xingyun.<br>After that, apart from the two Supreme Elders, the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and all the other elders also left.<br>After leaving, they all gathered at a certain luxurious palace in the Tantai Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, are you truly leaving that monster alive because of that Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You should know how terrifying that Black-feathered Specter is. If it wasn&rsquo;t for that senior expert&rsquo;s grand formation, we would not even be able to capture its tracks, and could only continue to allow ourselves to be toyed with by it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, considering the safety of our clansmen, we should execute the Black-feathered Specter immediately. We should not be leaving it alive.&rdquo;<br>Inside the palace hall, the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s elders began to plead to their Lord Clan Chief to kill the Black-feathered Specter.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that they were heartless and unconcerned about Bai Liluo&rsquo;s life and death. Instead, the shadow of the Black-feather Specter upon their Tantai Heavenly Clan was truly too deep. This was especially true after they saw the monster itself; they were able to sense how terrifying of an existence it was. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the grand demon suppression formation, they would simply not be a match for it.<br>In this sort of situation, they would naturally wish to immediately execute the Black-feathered Specter.<br>&ldquo;Did you all think that I don't wish to execute it?&rdquo; the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief suddenly asked.<br>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; Hearing those words, the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s elders all revealed confused expressions.<br>&ldquo;That monster is no small matter. Even the grand demon suppression formation is unable to immediately kill it. It can only slowly disintegrate its power so that we can kill it later.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since we're unable to immediately kill it anyways, it's better that we do Chu Feng a favor at little cost, and make him believe that we are not killing the Black-feathered Specter right away because of him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If this matter is to spread to Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s ears, it will definitely be a thing with a hundred benefits and no detriment to our clan,&rdquo; the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief is truly brilliant!&rdquo; Hearing those words, the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s elders came to a sudden realization.<br></p></div>
