        <h1>Chapter 5651: Turning the Tables</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I confirmed that the method to find the second door lies inside the mural, but I didn&rsquo;t have enough time to grasp its entirety. Why don&rsquo;t we split the work? You&rsquo;ll deal with this part, and I&rsquo;ll take the rest,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he divided their workload.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a larger portion of the workload as he had more purple fruits than Fu Xing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Fu Xing replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them swallowed all of the purple fruits in a single mouth. Their imprints strengthened, but they paid no attention to it. They only had one shot to comprehend everything on the murals around them, or else they would have to leave this place without uncovering the secret behind the Nine Heavens Secret Domain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time passed quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng successfully grasped the area he was in charge of. When he opened his eyes, he saw Fu Xing staring at him with a faint curl on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It looks like you have succeeded,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What about you?&rdquo; Fu Xing asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of his sleeves, Chu Feng drew out a complicated formation blueprint with his spirit power. Fu Xing did the same as well. By overlapping the two individual formation blueprints, they formed the complete formation blueprint required to open the second door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng and Fu Xing worked together and quickly constructed the formation in the blueprint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the formation was completed, the hall suddenly shook. Tremendous spirit power gushed from all directions into the formation, and a humongous door slowly manifested in the middle of the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door slowly creaked open, revealing what lay within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was another identical hall with a massive flower field in the middle. The only difference was the murals on the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng and Fu Xing exchanged glances before walking in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flower field overturned, raising a cloud of dust. A humongous tree with a height exceeding ten thousand meters rose from the ground. Unlike the other fruit trees, this one wasn&rsquo;t withered. This tree was filled with leaves, though the entire tree was black in color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The creepiest thing about the tree was that it was emanating a faint light despite being pitch black, making it look exceptionally brilliant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These hinted that there was something peculiar about the tree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to the color of the tree, Chu Feng and Fu Xing were unable to tell if it had any </span><span>black fruits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You have done well coming this far, but you only have three chances,&rdquo; a childish voice reminiscent of a ten-year-old child echoed from behind the tree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A two-meter-tall humanoid figure walked out from behind the tree. His face was concealed, and he was dressed in imposing black armor that appeared to be made out of black tree bark. His sharp fangs were </span><span>bared</span><span> menacingly when he spoke, and his white eyes were luminescent like a monstrous beast&rsquo;s, though it was filled with confidence instead of bloodthirst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Your first chance begins now,&rdquo; the humanoid figure said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tremendous spirit power flooded out of his shuddering body, forming a massive tsunami that crashed down on Chu Feng and Fu Xing. He was a Royal Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, comparable to a rank six Half-God level cultivator, but neither Chu Feng nor Fu Xing dared to underestimate his fighting prowess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng and Fu Xing quickly worked together to construct a protective formation that split the hall into two in hopes of blocking the other party&rsquo;s attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tsunami crashed down on the protective formation, exerting heavy pressure on Chu Feng and Fu Xing. The other party&rsquo;s spirit power was too strong that they had to give it their all despite working together with each other, or else their protective formation would crumble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng suddenly widened his eyes, as he noticed a surge of teleportation energy manifesting in front of him and Fu Xing. He couldn&rsquo;t see the teleportation energy, but he could feel it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; Chu Feng exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave up on channeling the formation and dragged Fu Xing away with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The protective formation collapsed. Fu Xing was infuriated, till she saw the black humanoid figure appearing where they were standing earlier with a formation saber in hand. Her eyes widened in realization, only to see the other party look at her with a sinister smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black humanoid figure suddenly vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A powerful surge of spirit power enveloped Chu Feng and Fu Xing. The black humanoid figure had appeared behind them, and his spirit power squarely struck the two of them. While the spirit power failed to harm them, it sent them flying across the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black humanoid figure flitted forth with his formation saber resting on his shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His white eyes were still fierce and sinister, but Chu Feng and Fu Xing could see a hint of contempt in it too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You have two more chances,&rdquo; the black humanoid figure said as he put his formation saber down beside him and closed his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re being underestimated,&rdquo; Fu Xing told Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng responded with a faint smile. It was true that he was being looked down on, but it was a fact that the opponent was really powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always thought that his spirit power fighting prowess was formidable, but the black humanoid figure&rsquo;s control of spirit power was far sharper than his. Whether it was the initial tsunami of spirit power, the teleportation, or the blast of spirit power that pushed them away, they were all profound formations beyond Chu Feng&rsquo;s current means to execute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black humanoid figure had tremendous spirit power, formidable formations, and outstanding combat experience. He was like an insurmountable mountain in their path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless Chu Feng and Fu Xing could raise their fighting prowess to its limit, their chances of defeating him were slim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fu Xing flicked her wrist and took out a lump of black metal. </span><span>Uponcareful</span><span> look, it was a sword, just that it was so shabby that it looked no different from a metallic lump.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng licked his lips upon seeing the sword, knowing that the sword was a powerful treasure. This was their hope of turning the tables around.</span></p></div>
