        <h1>Chapter 2976</h1>
        <div> - Ruthless Gaze<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>"Eeaaahhh~~~"<br>Chu Haoyan's miserable scream was still resonating.<br>Chu Haoyan covered his mutilated mouth with his hands, and was rolling on the ground and screaming in pain.<br>The people present were looking at Her Lady Queen with astonishment on their faces.<br>At the moment when Her Lady Queen unleashed her attack, they had all felt Her Lady Queen's aura.<br>Her Lady Queen was most definitely not as simple as only a rank five True Immortal.<br>"H-H-Heaven-defying battle power?!"<br>"To still possess heaven-defying battle power at True Immortal realm?!"<br>"Furthermore, a battle power capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation on top of that?!!!"<br>The crowd simply did not dare to believe what they sensed. After all, upon reaching the True Immortal realm, even they, possessors of a Heavenly Lightning Bloodline, ended up losing their heaven-defying battle power.<br>However, Her Lady Queen actually still possessed her heaven-defying battle power. Furthermore, it was so frighteningly powerful, capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation. With this, how could they not be astonished?<br>"Is this how powerful Asura World Spirits are?"<br>"Is this how powerful the kings among world spiritists are?"<br>While the people of the older generation were still able to keep calm, the people of the younger generation were actually looking at Her Lady Queen with fear in their eyes.<br>How could they not be afraid? After all, with a cultivation of rank five True Immortal and a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation, Her Lady Queen was capable of slaughtering all of them.<br>At that moment, even the proud and conceited Chu Ruoshi revealed a complicated expression. Contained within her complicated gaze was not only astonishment, but also a trace of hostility.<br>The reason for that was because she was unable to help herself from thinking about if she could defeat such a powerful Her Lady Queen. If she could not, would that mean that she would be defeated by Chu Feng in the upcoming Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition?<br>That's right, with a world spirit as powerful as Her Lady Queen on his side, how could anyone from the younger generation be able to contend against him?<br>Not to mention the people of the younger generation, it was likely that no True Immortal would be able to contend against him.<br>"Chu Feng, this Queen will return now," Her Lady Queen was very smart. She did not attempt to continue attacking Chu Haoyan. Instead, she directly entered the World Spirit Gate.<br>The reason for that was because she knew that countless eyes were focused on her at that moment. If she were to do something that endangered Chu Haoyan's life, someone would definitely act to save him.<br>At that time, Chu Feng might be implicated. After all, that Chu Haoyan was someone with quite a background.<br>"Buzz~~~"<br>After Her Lady Queen returned to Chu Feng's world spirit space, Chu Xuanzhengfa pointed his finger downward. Immediately, light started sprinking down like a gentle rain. The light sprinkled onto Chu Haoyan.<br>With that, Chu Haoyan's mutilated face actually started to recover. The miserable pain he felt also eased up.<br>"Fucking bitch! I&rsquo;ll kill you!" After having his injuries cured, Chu Haoyan shouted with incomparable fury.<br>"Haoyan, you must accept your losses. Do not make that friend from the Asura Spirit World feel that our Chu Heavenly Clan is incapable of taking defeat with grace," Chu Xuanzhengfa said.<br>"But, she unleashed a surprise attack at me earlier. Otherwise, it would be impossible for me to be struck," Chu Haoyan defended himself.<br>"Is that so?" Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.<br>"That's right. Senior, that is precisely it," Chu Haoyan nodded.<br>At that moment, Chu Xuanzhengfa narrowed his eyes. He smiled lightly. "According to what you've said, you're trying to say that you would be injured by a surprise attack from someone with a weaker cultivation than your own?"<br>"Of course not," Chu Haoyan shook his head.<br>"Then you're trying to say that if I attack you, as long as it's not a surprise attack, you will be capable of defending against it?" Chu Xuanzhengfa asked again.<br>"I..." Chu Haoyan didn&rsquo;t know how to answer.<br>"It's enough. You yourself know the best what happened. That young lady has already gone easy on you. Otherwise, you would definitely not have only your mouth ripped apart," Chu Xuanzhengfa said.<br>Once Chu Xuanzhengfa said those words, there were even others from the Chu Heavenly Clan that revealed gazes of agreement.<br>That's right, that was someone with a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation. How could Chu Haoyan possibly be a match for her?<br>Furthermore, those dark black gaseous flames were extremely remarkable. Logically, for someone of Chu Haoyan's cultivation, not to mention having his mouth ripped apart, even if his body was shattered, he would not utter a single sound of pain.<br>However, Chu Haoyan was screaming miserably earlier. That was something they had all witnessed.<br>This meant that the attack from that Asura World Spirit, although simple, was definitely very remarkable.<br>At the very least, her attack brought Chu Haoyan unbearable pain.<br>"Senior Zhengfa, you also heard the agreement between Chu Haoyan and I earlier. May I know if it could take effect now," Chu Feng asked.<br>"Once a man agrees to something, even a team of horses cannot unsay it. Chu Haoyan agreed to it, thus he will naturally have to accept his losses. The men of our Chu Heavenly Clan will never go back upon their word."<br>After he said those words, Chu Xuanzhengfa looked to Chu Haoyan, "Am I right, Haoyan?"<br>Chu Haoyan had an extremely displeased expression on his face. However, there was nothing he could say. He couldn't possibly declare that he was going to go back on his promise before all those people.<br>If he were to do that, he would not only humiliate himself, but he would also humiliate his father, his grandfather, and the entire Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>"Chu Feng, you've won. You can handle my qualification to enter the Nine Moons Sacred Domain as you wish," as Chu Haoyan spoke, he tossed a title plate to Chu Feng.<br>The words 'Nine Moons Sacred Domain.' were written on that title plate<br>That was not a title plate for participating in the selection. Instead, it was a title plate for entering the Nine Moons Sacred Domain.<br>"Chu Feng, this is yours," at that moment, a Chu Heavenly Clan elder walked over to Chu Feng and handed him another Nine Moons Sacred Domain title plate.<br>While Chu Feng took a long time to walk out of the Death Gate, it remained that he had passed through the Death Gate. Thus, regardless of how long it took, Chu Feng was qualified to enter the Nine Moons Sacred Domain. That title plate was something that Chu Feng had obtained himself.<br>"Thank you senior," Chu Feng accepted the title plate from that elder and placed it in his clothes.<br>As for the title plate that was tossed to him by Chu Haoyan, he kept holding it in his hand the entire time.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng suddenly turned around and walked over to Chu Yue. He handed the title plate to her. "Big sis Chu Yue, you can enter the Nine Moons Sacred Domain and train together with me."<br>"Little brother Chu Feng, I..."<br>Tears were flickering in Chu Yue's beautiful eyes. An expression filled her entire face, an expression of being moved.<br>"Just accept it. It belongs to you," Chu Feng placed the title plate into Chu Yue's hands.<br>After the title plate entered her hands, Chu Yue not only started crying, but her body also started shivering. Quietly, she said, "Thank you."<br>"Even if that title plate belongs to her, I'm afraid she will not be able to enter the Nine Moons Sacred Domain," right at that moment, a resounding voice suddenly exploded in the distant sky.<br>Turning toward the source of the sound, the space there was trembling. As the shaking continued, a figure gradually appeared.<br>That was an old man. He was not very tall, but he had a very long beard. His face was also very fierce-looking.<br>His shrewd and ruthless eyes were currently looking at Chu Feng with ill-intentions.<br><br><br></p></div>
