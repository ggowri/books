        <div><span>: The Prowess of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>&ldquo;Xianhai Yu&rsquo;er?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng was surprised to hear that name. He had not only heard about Xianhai Yu&rsquo;er; he was acquainted with her too.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Little Fishy? Has that girl grown that powerful?&rdquo; Eggy was surprised too.</span><br><span>Their impression of Little Fishy was still stuck at that of an adorable little child.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It looks like she has grown up fast,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a chuckle.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Xianhai Yu&rsquo;er is the little princess of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan, right?&rdquo; the four daoists asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! The woman is known to be the number one beauty of the Immortal Sea Galaxy, Xianhai Yu&rsquo;er. A pity it is that the Immortal Fish Sea Clan is so protective of her; I haven&rsquo;t been able to catch a glimpse of her to this day. I&rsquo;m dying to know just how ravishing this number one beauty is,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing muttered expectantly.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I have long heard that the Immortal Sea Fish Clan&rsquo;s little princess is extraordinarily talented, but she should still be quite young compared to the other juniors in the current generation. I find it hard to believe that she conquered the Immemorial Star Sea at her age. Young friend, is your news reliable?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The four daoists found Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s words hard to believe. It was not that they thought that Bai Yunqing was an untrustworthy person but that they knew just how difficult it was to conquer the Immemorial Star Sea.</span><br><span>Even Jie Ranqing was unable to do it back then. How could the much younger Xianhai Yu&rsquo;er pull it off?</span><br><span>&ldquo;Elders, my news is reliable,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s true, the Immortal Fish Sea Clan is going to rise through the ranks. Xianhai Shaoyu is already formidable as he is, and now they have a Xianhai Yu&rsquo;er too,&rdquo; Daoist Ninth Dragon said with a sigh.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It might not be a good thing for her to prematurely expose her sharp edge,&rdquo; Daoist Sixth Dragon said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Sixth Brother, are you saying that the other overlords might go after her?&rdquo; Daoist Seventh Dragon asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re currently living in the God&rsquo;s Era. None of the juniors in this era are to be made light of. Their talents signal a future shift in the world&rsquo;s power balance. The emergence of two monstrously talented individuals in the Immortal Sea Fish Clan severely threatens the current status quo. If the other powers don&rsquo;t step in right now and stop those two from maturing, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before the world is dominated by the Immortal Sea Fish Clan,&rdquo; Daoist Sixth Dragon explained.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Sixth Brother. I don&rsquo;t know about the other powers, but the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion won&rsquo;t allow such a situation to happen,&rdquo; Daoist Seventh Dragon agreed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion that domineering?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>He felt goodwill toward the Immortal Sea Fish Clan, particularly because both Xianhai Shaoyu and Xianhai Yu&rsquo;er were his close pals. He wouldn&rsquo;t want to see danger befalling either of them.</span><br><span>Based on what he had heard, the most domineering power in the current world of cultivation was none other than the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.</span><br><span>&ldquo;The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion is the strongest world spiritist organization in the world of cultivation. They have a huge say on world issues, but they tend to be very self-centered. If there was a single organization in the world that no one was willing to offend, that would be the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion,&rdquo; Daoist Sixth Dragon explained.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion stronger than the other overlords?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Other than the Eastern Region, most galaxy overlords are actually pretty close to each other. While the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion is thought to be the strongest, there isn&rsquo;t really a huge disparity between it and the other powers. The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion would be in trouble if the other powers choose to gang up on it.</span><br><span>&ldquo;However, there has been a rumor that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion has an ancestor whose strength towers above even that of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master. That&rsquo;s something huge, considering how the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master is considered to be the strongest individual in the current world of cultivation,&rdquo; Daoist Sixth Dragon said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Strongest individual? Is the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master stronger than the other galaxy overlords?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Rumor has it that they have once crossed blows. The Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster, the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, and the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master worked together to fight the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master. The outcome of the duel was a draw.</span><br><span>&ldquo;There was no victor to the duel, and the parties involved claimed that it was only a spar and that none of them had used their full strength, but the fact that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master was able to simultaneously deal with three powerhouses without falling into a disadvantageous position spoke a lot about his strength,&rdquo; Daoist Sixth Dragon said.</span><br><span>Chu Feng was starting to get a glimpse into how powerful the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master was.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Currently, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master, the Immortal Sea Fish Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster, and the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master are thought to be of the same level. However, if we have to pick out the strongest one amongst them, </span><span>most people would agree that it&rsquo;s the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Furthermore, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion isn&rsquo;t just strong because of its mansion master. It has plenty of experts in its ranks too. I doubt that any of the other powerhouses would be able to defeat the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion in a one-on-one battle.</span><br><span>&ldquo;If the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion truly had an ancestor whose strength surpassed that of its mansion master, the truth would be that it already possessed the qualification to rule over the entire world of cultivation, just that they had refrained from doing so for whatever reason,&rdquo; Daoist Sixth Dragon further elaborated.</span><br><span>&ldquo;The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion is more powerful than I thought. Chu Feng, you have a huge hurdle to overcome here,&rdquo; Eggy said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo; Chu Feng agreed.</span><br><span>However, he didn&rsquo;t despair because of that. It was only normal for the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion to be that powerful, or else his father wouldn&rsquo;t have failed to rescue his mother.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Do you know how powerful the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master and the other galaxy overlords are?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a question no one has the answer to. Those people rarely make a public appearance, and only experts of the same caliber are able to approach them. However, it&rsquo;s rumored that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master is a pinnacle True Dragon World Spiritist, whereas the other galaxy overlords are at pinnacle True God level,&rdquo; Daoist Sixth Dragon replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Pinnacle True Dragon World Spiritist? Chu Feng, you have a long way ahead of you,&rdquo; Eggy said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;At least I have reached Half-God level now,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You sure are optimistic. Pinnacle True God level is likely to already be their limit, but it&rsquo;ll be nothing more than a phase for you. Looking at it from such a perspective, you&rsquo;re indeed not too far away from your goal,&rdquo; Eggy said with a chuckle.</span><br><span>She had always been confident in Chu Feng.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, you seem to be quite curious about the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. Are you looking to join them?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not it. I just want to have a better understanding of the power distribution in the world of cultivation lest I appear ignorant,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, no one will dare to think that you&rsquo;re ignorant. You&rsquo;re bound to have a place in God&rsquo;s Era too,&rdquo; Daoist Sixth Dragon said,</span><br><span>The other three daoists and Bai Yunqing nodded in agreement.</span><br><span>&ldquo;This feeling?&rdquo;</span><br><span>All of a sudden, the four daoists looked at one another with widened eyes. Unease began showing on their faces. It was as if something huge was about to happen.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, elders?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, something urgent cropped up. I&rsquo;m afraid that we won&rsquo;t be able </span><span>to accompany you on your journey anymore,&rdquo; Daoist Sixth Dragon said.</span><br><span>He took out a treasure containing an immense amount of spirit power. Chu Feng could tell that this treasure had the power to allow one to immediately exit a teleportation passageway.</span><br><span>Something huge must have happened for them to be in such a rush.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Elders, is there anything I can help you with?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>While he already knew that the four daoists had only offered him their help out of fear of Tao Wu, it didn&rsquo;t change the fact that they were his benefactors. He owed them a favor for that.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, I appreciate your goodwill, but I&rsquo;m afraid that you won&rsquo;t be able to help us. I advise you to remain wary about the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. They are the mastermind behind those small fries back on the Unageing Peak, just that their plan was thwarted by us.</span><br><span>&ldquo;The Pill Dao Immortal Sect is a vicious organization. They won&rsquo;t let you go just because they have been thwarted once. Without a doubt, there&rsquo;ll be more attacks in the future. If possible, you should keep a low profile or even change your appearance. Don&rsquo;t wander around with your real name anymore,&rdquo; Daoist Sixth Dragon said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Thank you for your advice. I&rsquo;ll take note of it,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a nod.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Sixth Brother.&rdquo;</span><br><span>The other three daoists urged Daoist Sixth Dragon.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, I hope that we&rsquo;ll be able to meet again.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Daoist Sixth Dragon activated the treasure and tore an opening in the teleportation passageway. The four daoists quickly stepped out of the teleportation passageway.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, why do Daoist Sixth Dragon&rsquo;s words sound so ominous? It is almost as if they are about to march to their death!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;They must have encountered a huge problem.&rdquo; Chu Feng guessed.</span><br></p></div>
