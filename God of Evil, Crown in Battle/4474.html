        <h1>Chapter 4473</h1>
        <div>: Fearless<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Those words from Zhao Batian caused Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s face to stiffen. She was really frightened by what she had just heard.<br>Even though her body had changed along with her disguise, there was no way she would have been willing to reveal her body before everyone.<br>Even the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was shocked too, but he still showed no signs of making a move at all.<br>&ldquo;Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, are you still going to stand by the side and watch the show like an onlooker? That&rsquo;s your daughter over there! If anyone dares to do that to my daughter, I would lop his head off in an instant. Yet, you still are in the mood to continue watching here?&rdquo; the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster mocked the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief coldly.<br>He wasn&rsquo;t close with Long Xiaoxiao, so it was natural that he wouldn&rsquo;t risk himself for her. However, he couldn&rsquo;t stand to see how the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was willing to forsake his daughter so easily.<br>Had it been his kin in the same position, there was no way he would have been able to bring himself to watch idly by the side.<br>And he wasn&rsquo;t the only one who felt that way.<br>The Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, the Supreme Elders of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect, and the other top-notch experts were all looking at the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, and there was a hint of disdain in their eyes.<br>They felt that the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was being a little too unfeeling here.<br>But despite the gazes on him, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief still remained unmoved. He continued holding Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother down while disallowing Long Busheng from making a move.<br>It was true that Long Xiaoxiao was the future of the Dragon Clan, but the Dragon Clan would have no future if it were to be obliterated by the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.<br>The pros and cons were very obvious to him.<br>&ldquo;At this rate, Miss Long won&rsquo;t be able to face anyone anymore,&rdquo; a Supreme Elder from the Cloudsky Immortal Sect remarked, seeing that the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was still not intending to make a move.<br>If Long Xiaoxiao were to be really stripped bare before the crowd, it would be a huge trauma to her, especially if her father was standing by the side but refused to help her.<br>Swoosh!<br>But at this moment, a silhouette suddenly rose to the air.<br>Seeing this, the expressions on the crowd turned a little complicated. To be honest, they had a feeling inside that things would eventually turn out this way.<br>That was because the person was no other than Chu Feng.<br>After everything that had happened, the crowd managed to get a grasp of just what kind of person Chu Feng was&mdash;obstinate and fearless.<br>It was just that they didn&rsquo;t think that Chu Feng would really dare to step forth in such a situation. It was the Nine Souls Sacred Clan that they could possibly be up against here!<br>&ldquo;Does he really not fear death?&rdquo; Yin Daifen, who had been watching from the sky as everything unfolded, muttered with a complicated look in her eyes.<br>She had known that Chu Feng and Long Xiaoxiao were on extremely close terms with one another, but to be honest, she couldn&rsquo;t have guessed that Chu Feng would actually step in despite the risk of offending the Zhao Clan.<br>One must know that this was a situation where even Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s birth father, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, dared not to make a move!<br>But Chu Feng still chose to step in despite knowing this. It was not ignorance at play here but true bravery.<br>Yin Daifen clearly saw Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s face tensing up when she saw Chu Feng approaching her.<br>Even though neither of them said a word, the smart Yin Daifen was still able to tell that Long Xiaoxiao was sending a voice transmission to Chu Feng, urging him to leave before he caught the attention of the Zhao Clan.<br>Despite so, Chu Feng still chose to step forward.<br>He had already made up his mind, and no one could change his will!<br>Watching this sight, Yin Daifen couldn&rsquo;t help but feel deeply envious of Long Xiaoxiao.<br>While those of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect treated her with utmost respect, she knew deep down that if she had been in the same plight as Long Xiaoxiao, none of them would have been willing to step forward for her.<br>&ldquo;Who is that fellow?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Is he really intending to step up at this moment? Is he tired of living?!&rdquo;<br>The crowd exclaimed in astonishment.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s movement had finally caught the attention of the onlookers around.<br>Other than those from the Holy Light Galaxy, none of the onlookers here recognized Chu Feng. They had no idea what Chu Feng was up to, but they knew for certain that anyone who caught Chu Batian&rsquo;s attention at this moment would be in for a ride of suffering!<br>Surprisingly, Zhao Batian didn&rsquo;t spare Chu Feng a glance. He was in no mood to bother with a mere insignificant ant.<br>However, the others from the Zhao Clan began shouting angrily at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You twat, are you disrespecting our Zhao Clan over here? Scram! You might be tired of living, but don&rsquo;t implicate us here!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Get lost right now, or else your entire clan will be paying the price of your folly!&rdquo;<br>The ones who were exceptionally harsh on Chu Feng were the two old men who were guarding the entrance of the barrier. Even though their words sounded awful, interestingly, they were communicating with Chu Feng via voice transmission.<br>While Chu Feng had no idea why they were doing this, he simply disregarded their words, acting as if he hadn&rsquo;t heard them at all.<br>He reached into his Cosmos Sack and took out a gourd. A streak of light burst forth from the gourd, and a beautiful spirit beast appeared before everyone&rsquo;s eyes.<br>&ldquo;This is the spirit beast.&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing the spirit beast, a huge commotion broke out amidst the crowd.<br>Those from the Zhao Clan who were berating Chu Feng a moment ago gasped in shock.<br>Even Zhao Batian had turned his sight over to Chu Feng as glee filled his face. This was the spirit beast that his younger brother, Zhao Yuzhuo, was looking for!<br>&ldquo;Who could have thought that fellow would actually manage to find that spirit beast!&rdquo;<br>At the same time, the two old men guarding the barrier also trembled in agitation too.<br>They were the ones who let Chu Feng in earlier, and they knew very well the significance of the spirit beast to Zhao Yuzhuo.<br>Without a doubt, Chu Feng would be handsomely rewarded for his efforts here.<br>Shoosh!<br>Just as those from the Zhao Clan thought that Chu Feng would be handing the spirit beast over for a reward, Chu Feng suddenly grabbed the spirit beast by its vitals.<br>&ldquo;Let her go, and this spirit beast will be yours!&rdquo; Chu Feng pointed to Long Xiaoxiao as he spoke.<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s here to save her?&rdquo;<br>The crowd immediately understood Chu Feng&rsquo;s intention.<br>&ldquo;The two of you are in cahoots?&rdquo;<br>Zhao Batian narrowed his eyes as the smile on his face faded as viciousness crept into his eyes.<br>However, Chu Feng remained unfazed. Looking Zhao Batian directly in the eye, he quietly tightened his grasp on the spirit beast&rsquo;s vitals.<br>Awuuu!<br>The spirit beast cried in agony.<br>&ldquo;I told you to release her. Do you not hear me?&rdquo; Chu Feng bellowed at Zhao Batian.<br>&ldquo;You dare to threaten me?&rdquo;<br>Seeing how Chu Feng had no fear for him, Zhao Batian&rsquo;s rage intensified.<br>&ldquo;It looks like you don&rsquo;t want this spirit beast anymore,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he exerted even greater force into his grasp.<br>&ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo;<br>A furious shout suddenly echoed in the air.<br>Following that, a figure darted across the sky and stopped right beside Zhao Batian.<br>It was a young man who bore an uncanny resemblance to Zhao Batian. Without a doubt, he was Zhao Batian&rsquo;s younger brother, Zhao Yuzhuo, as well as the most influential person of the Zhao Clan at the moment.<br>He was the one who forged a connection between the Zhao Clan and the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, bringing about its rise to prominence.<br>No one knew why Zhao Yuzhuo was able to earn the fancy of a princess of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, but without a doubt, offending him would be the worst decision one could make.<br>The fact that even the domineering Zhao Batian had fallen silent after he appeared was more than enough to highlight his current standing within the Zhao Clan.<br>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t locals, right?&rdquo; Zhao Yuzhuo assessed Chu Feng curiously as he asked.<br>&ldquo;So what if we are, so what if we aren&rsquo;t?&rdquo; Chu Feng rebutted.<br>&ldquo;Heh.&rdquo;<br>Zhao Yuzhuo chuckled softly to himself before he began speaking, &ldquo;I advise you not to go against you. I don&rsquo;t think that you have a good understanding of who I, Zhao Yuzhuo, am, so you still don&rsquo;t comprehend the consequences of offending me, especially right here right now.&rdquo;<br>Those words were filled with threat.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng burst into laughter and said, &ldquo;It seems like you have really been emboldened by the Nine Souls Sacred Clan. Is it fun playing house behind the shadows of another?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This!!!&rdquo;<br>Those words caused shocked gasps to sound all around.<br>The onlookers thought that the only reason why Chu Feng dared to provoke the brothers from the Zhao Clan was because he didn&rsquo;t know the backing they had. However, Chu Feng&rsquo;s earlier words revealed that he knew of the relationship between the Zhao Clan and the Nine Souls Sacred Clan!<br>This, in turn, plunged the crowd deeper into confusion.<br>If he knew that Zhao Yuzhuo was backed by a princess of the Nine Soul Sacred Clan, why was he still doing such a thing?<br>Was he out of his mind, or did he have someone formidable backing him up to that allowed him to stand fearlessly before Zhao Yuzhuo?<br></p></div>
