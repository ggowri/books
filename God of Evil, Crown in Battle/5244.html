        <h1>Chapter 5245</h1>
        <div>: Commencement of Battle<br>&ldquo;What should we do, Lord Tingye?&rdquo; Situ Hongbo asked.<br>&ldquo;What else can we do? We have to wage war against him. Otherwise, our Situ World Spiritist Clan will become the world&rsquo;s laughingstock. Put Chu Feng on our wanted list. We have to capture him no matter what it takes. Kill anyone who dares to protect him,&rdquo; Situ Tingye ordered.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in a disadvantageous position here. We don&rsquo;t know where he is, and he has experts backing him up. Not to mention, he&rsquo;s a terrifying opponent to deal with too,&rdquo; Situ Hongbo said.<br>It was normal for him to be concerned after how Chu Feng killed off their talented juniors.<br>&ldquo;We can only ask for help,&rdquo; Situ Tingye said.<br>&ldquo;Ask for help?&rdquo; It took a while before Situ Hongbo understood what Situ Tingye was driving at. &ldquo;Are you referring to Immortal Slaughterer?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes. Not only did our previous clan chief have ties with Immortal Slaughterer, but they had also participated in our fight against the Golden Dragon Flame Sect. They should be glad to see the remnants of the Golden Dragon Flame Sect dead. With Immortal Slaughterer&rsquo;s help, we won&rsquo;t have to fear Chu Feng,&rdquo; Situ Tingye said.<br>&ldquo;Lord Tingye, will Immortal Slaughterer really help us?&rdquo; Situ Hongbo asked.<br>&ldquo;They likely will. Back then, Lord Qianyu of Immortal Slaughterer told us that if the Golden Dragon Flame Sect ever makes a comeback, they won&rsquo;t just stand still,&rdquo; Situ Tingye said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great!&rdquo;<br>Finally seeing a ray of hope in this despairing situation, Situ Hongbo and the other elders heaved a sigh of relief.<br>&hellip;<br>Chu Feng first returned to where Song Yuwei and Bitter Remembrance were to inform them of this matter. The two of them were delighted to learn that he had defeated all of the young prodigies of the Situ World Spiritist Clan in a single swoop and inherited their secret formations.<br>However, he had only dropped by to ease their mind. He was planning to leave soon to continue striking the Situ World Spiritist Clan while they were still in a fluster.<br>Song Yuwei was worried when she learned that Chu Feng was going to continue exacting vengeance on the Situ World Spiritist Clan, but she didn&rsquo;t try to retain him. She knew that this was a path that Chu Feng had to walk.<br>Furthermore, her confidence in him had deepened with his recent accomplishments. She was also starting to think that Chu Feng was much stronger than Song Luoyi was back then, be it in terms of talent, meticulousness, or viciousness.<br>They were plenty of outstanding juniors, but this was the first time she had seen a single junior who excelled in all aspects.<br>&ldquo;Elder, rest at ease and wait here for me. I&rsquo;ll return with the heads of the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a voice filled with animosity.<br>Song Yuwei saw him off with a smile, but as soon as he was gone, her eyes suddenly began to redden. She headed to a remote corner and started silently sobbing.<br>&ldquo;Lord Sectmaster, we&rsquo;ll soon be able to avenge you.&rdquo;<br>She was feeling a mix of happiness and sorrow.<br>She was overjoyed to know that the others would finally be avenged, but at the same time, she was upset because she knew that those who were dead wouldn&rsquo;t return just because they had been avenged.<br>She would have to bear this pain in her heart forever.<br>&hellip;<br>In the days to come, Chu Feng kept appearing in the various territories of the Situ World Spiritist Clan throughout the True Dragon Starfield.<br>There was only one fate for any Situ World Spiritist Clansmen who appeared before him&mdash;death. He decapitated them and took their heads away with him.<br>Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t moving around recklessly. He only targeted places he was confident in dealing with, so it was a massacre whenever he made a move.<br>News spread like wildfire.<br>More and more people learned that Song Luoyi had a grandson. They didn&rsquo;t know how Song Luoyi could have had a grandson, but that didn&rsquo;t matter anymore. The important thing was that her grandson was exceedingly powerful.<br>He singlehandedly killed all of the junior prodigies of the Situ World Spiritist Clan in their own junior hunting competition. Even Tang Xiu, a top-notch prodigy, wasn&rsquo;t a match for him.<br>He invaded the bases of the Situ World Spiritist Clan one after another, putting everyone he had encountered through unimaginable torture before decapitating them. Those who heard about his deeds were all shocked by his cruelty.<br>Not even the Situ World Spiritist Clan was this vicious when dealing with the Golden Dragon Flame Sect back then.<br>Deserters started appearing from the Situ World Spiritist Clan. Despite knowing that they would be hunted down by their own brethren, they still chose to turn their back on their clan. They would rather be killed by their own clansmen than face Chu Feng&rsquo;s insufferable torture.<br>Days later, Situ Tingye, Situ Hongbo, and the clan elders were gathered in the Situ World Spiritist Clan&rsquo;s headquarters.<br>As Situ Tingye browsed through the letters in his hand, his complexion grew increasingly awful. These letters were reports from the Situ World Spiritist Clan&rsquo;s bases, listing an increasing number of deserters with each passing day.<br>Who could have thought a day would come when the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen would turn their backs on their own clan? This was a humiliation to them.<br>&ldquo;Relay my orders. All Situ World Spiritist Clansmen are to consume the sacred medicine,&rdquo; Situ Tingye suddenly ordered.<br>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo;<br>The elders widened their eyes in shock.<br>They knew that the so-called sacred medicine was actually a poison served only in desperate times to keep their own clansmen from betraying their clan, but it had never been used in the long history of their clan before.<br>Yet, they were actually going to use it today?<br>Situ Hongbo frowned at the situation, but he didn&rsquo;t say a word. He knew that the Situ World Spiritist Clan had indeed reached a desperate position.<br>While the elders were still processing the situation, a clansman had already placed exquisite little boxes right in front of each of the elders. Within it was the sacred medicine.<br>&ldquo;I, Situ Tingye, as a grand elder of the Situ World Spiritist Clan, will lead by example.&rdquo;<br>Without any hesitation, Situ Tingye swallowed the sacred medicine.<br>&ldquo;I, Situ Hongbo, am willing to share the same fate as the Situ World Spiritist Clan!&rdquo; Situ Hongbo made his declaration and swallowed the sacred medicine too.<br>Some of the elders followed suit, but most of them showed hesitant looks. They knew that there would be no turning back once they swallowed the sacred medicine.<br>There was no way to cure the poison. They could only alleviate its effects by periodically consuming an antidote, and failure to do so would spell an extremely excruciating death. Their lives would be held in the grasp of the upper echelons of the clan.<br>Should those above refuse to hand them the antidote, they would be goners.<br>&ldquo;Does the rest of you have a problem with this arrangement?&rdquo;<br>Situ Tingye&rsquo;s gaze turned cold.<br>&ldquo;Lord Grand Elder, we need to carefully think this matter through. News will spread if we have all our clansmen consume the sacred medicine. How will the rest of the world view us if they learn about this?&rdquo; an elder stood up and asked.<br>&ldquo;How they view us is their problem. The important thing is to ensure that our own people are loyal to our clan. We are fellow clansmen who carry the bloodline of the Situ Clan in our veins. Those who don&rsquo;t have the courage to go through with something like this aren&rsquo;t worthy of being a member of our Situ Clan!&rdquo; Situ Tingye said.<br>He clapped his hand<br>Bam!<br>The elder who had spoken earlier was immediately reduced to a puddle of blood.<br>&ldquo;Those who refuse to consume the sacred medicine will be killed!&rdquo; Situ Tingye declared imposingly as he enveloped the room with his oppressive might and murderous intent.<br>&ldquo;We are willing to bind our fates to the Situ World Spiritist Clan!&rdquo;<br>The other elders hurriedly consumed the sacred medicine.<br>The pros and cons were clear here. They might still be able to survive after consuming the sacred medicine if they had a steady supply of the antidotes, but refusal to swallow the sacred medicine here spelled death.<br>&ldquo;Relay my orders. Anyone who refuses to consume the sacred medicine will be killed without exception! Anyone who dares leak the news out will also be killed without exception. With this, I conclude this meeting!&rdquo; Situ Tingye said with a grand wave of his sleeves.<br>The elders hurriedly left the room afterward, leaving Situ Tingye and Situ Hongbo in the room. Situ Tingye slumped down on his seat, looking as if he had aged decades in a split second.<br>&ldquo;Lord Tingye, are you fine?&rdquo; Situ Hongbo asked.<br>&ldquo;How can I be fine? The Situ World Spiritist Clan is going to be destroyed!&rdquo; Situ Tingye exclaimed with a hoarse sigh.<br>It was not as if they hadn&rsquo;t tried dealing with Chu Feng, but the latter was slippery as a loach.<br>It felt like he was always a step ahead of them. To make things worse, whenever Chu Feng made an appearance, a massacre was bound to occur.<br>&ldquo;Is there still no news from Immortal Slaughterer?&rdquo; Situ Hongbo asked.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no response yet,&rdquo; Situ Tingye replied with a shake of his head.<br>Situ Hongbo had already expected such an answer. Things wouldn&rsquo;t have come to this point if Immortal Slaughterer was truly willing to help them.<br>&ldquo;Since things have already gotten to this point, should we request our clan chief to come out of his closed-door training?&rdquo; Situ Hongbo asked.<br></div>
