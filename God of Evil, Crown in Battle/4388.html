        <div>: Bet On Our Lives<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;What are you so anxious for? Why don&rsquo;t we&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng began speaking up.<br>Even though it hadn&rsquo;t been long since he met Liu Shangwu, he didn&rsquo;t wish to see such at tragic plight fall upon the latter. So, he chose to stand up for him.<br>He hoped that he could reverse the situation by challenging Zhao Xuanhe and defeating him.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>But before Chu Feng could finish his words, Liu Shangwu had already spoken up.<br>Liu Shangwu was in a very feeble state at the moment, which was perfectly normal since he had just burned his own bloodline and soul.<br>However, there was still a trace of a smile on his face.<br>&ldquo;As a man, I&rsquo;ll fulfill the end of my bargain. I, Liu Shangwu, am a person of my word.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Liu Shangwu turned to Zhao Xuanhe and said, &ldquo;Zhao Xuanhe, you have won today. Regardless of whether it was with your true skills or with the help of the treasure, it&rsquo;s true that I was lacking and I&rsquo;ll admit my defeat. However, as long as I have a breath in me, I&rsquo;ll do all I can to exact vengeance for my cousin.&rdquo;<br>Viciousness surfaced on Liu Shangwu&rsquo;s face after saying those words.<br>Shoosh.<br>With a flick of his wrist, he took out a sharp knife from his Cosmos Sack.<br>It was an Incomplete Divine Armament.<br>Pu!<br>Pu!<br>Pu!<br>With a few cold glints, fresh blood spurted forth from Liu Shangwu.<br>He had used the Incomplete Divine Armament to blind himself and sever his hands and legs.<br>From a complete man, he had turned into a cripple.<br>&ldquo;Brother Liu, you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Seeing this sight, Chu Feng felt extremely heavy inside.<br>Liu Shangwu was thorough in his actions. He had severed not just his limbs physically but from his soul too. A wound to the soul wouldn&rsquo;t be easy to repair.<br>Even Chu Feng was helpless in the face of such a situation.<br>Unless Liu Shangwu were to obtain some valuable recovery treasure or engage the help of a formidable world spiritist, he might have to live his life like that.<br>However, Liu Shangwu didn&rsquo;t let out the slightest sound or shed any tears.<br>Even though he had crippled himself, he was still a cultivator and a world spiritist. He had his own dignity.<br>He used the spirit power to curb his bleeding before floating into the air and leaving the area.<br>He had really thoroughly lost this time around, and his departing figure looked incredibly forlorn.<br>However, there weren&rsquo;t many people who felt bad for him. Instead, many of them mocked him, saying that he got what he deserved.<br>It was just that Chu Feng felt even heavier inside.<br>Had Zhao Xuanhe not used his treasure, Liu Shangwu would have been the one who won the battle. Furthermore, he believed that Liu Shangwu&rsquo;s words were true, and that Zhao Xuanhe was the reprehensible one here.<br>Yet, somehow, Zhao Xuanhe was the one who won gleefully in the end, and Liu Shangwu was left in a tragic plight.<br>&ldquo;Brother Liu, please wait for a moment,&rdquo; Chu Feng shouted out. &ldquo;I hope that you can spectate my battle.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Liu Shangwu halted his movement. He hesitated for a moment before turning around, &ldquo;Alright, Brother Chu. I&rsquo;ll spectate your battle.&rdquo;<br>After that, Liu Shangwu headed toward a corner of the spectator&rsquo;s stand.<br>At this very moment, the energy sealing off the dueling ring had already vanished, allowing Chu Feng to get in.<br>He was here for the prize, so even if not for the grudge between Liu Shangwu and Zhao Xuanhe, this was still a battle that would have still occurred.<br>&ldquo;It looks like you&rsquo;re on close terms with him. Are you planning to exact vengeance for him? What are you going to bet with me this time around?&rdquo;<br>Zhao Xuanhe could see the rage in Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes, but he had no fear at all. Instead, he began provoking Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Looks like we share the same thoughts,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Shall we have the same bet as before then? Do you dare to do the same as him?&rdquo; Zhao Xuanhe looked at Chu Feng provocatively.<br>But in response to those words, Chu Feng chuckled and said, &ldquo;Why not be more decisive than that? Let&rsquo;s bet our lives.&rdquo;<br>Whoosh!<br>It caused a huge uproar in an instant. Many people couldn&rsquo;t believe what they were hearing.<br>The young man was going to bet his life against Zhao Xuanhe?<br>One must know that Zhao Xuanhe had just defeated Liu Shangwu with ease!<br>And even though this young man named Chu Feng did clear the Death Dominion, he was a nobody here. Just what in the world gave him the confidence to make such a bet?<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu, there&rsquo;s no need for you to do that!&rdquo;<br>Liu Shangwu immediately tried to stop Chu Feng. He thought that Chu Feng was doing it because of him.<br>&ldquo;Brother Liu, this matter has nothing to do with you. It&rsquo;s a private affair between me and Zhao Xuanhe. This person has done too much evil in this world. Who knows how many more victims of his atrocities there will be if we were to keep him alive? I&rsquo;m determined to end his life today!&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;What huge words! I can see that you are even more shameless than Liu Shangwu. Not only do you seek to defame me, but you even want to play the role of an envoy of justice. Let&rsquo;s see how far you can go with this act then!&rdquo; Zhao Xuanhe sneered.<br>&ldquo;So, you are going to agree with the bet?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I, Zhao Xuanhe, am not a person who kills the innocent. But you and Liu Shangwu are reprehensible scums of the world. I have a duty to eliminate you from the face of the world so that you won&rsquo;t go around harming others!&rdquo; Zhao Xuanhe said.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, I hope you can bear witness to those words. If I, Chu Feng, were to lose to Zhao Xuanhe, my life will be his. But if I were to win, his life will be mine for the taking,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>However, there was no one who paid any heed to Chu Feng at all. Instead, all sorts of contemptuous remarks sounded from the crowd instead.<br>They felt that Chu Feng was daydreaming.<br>However, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t lose his cool. He had expected to face such a situation. In the first place, his words were not directed toward everyone but just a selected few, such as the eight disciples of the Lady of Dao Sea and the Sagacious Grandmaster.<br>He believed that people of their standing would still uphold fairness in the world.<br>&ldquo;Cut the nonsense. If you dare not go ahead with it, you can scram right now. Otherwise, once the duel begins, it&rsquo;ll be too late for you back out!&rdquo; Zhao Xuanhe sneered.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s begin then. You&rsquo;ll attack the first round and I&rsquo;ll defend,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Is that fellow insane?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s response stirred another huge uproar amongst the crowd.<br>In the first place, many of them thought that Chu Feng only managed to get here with Liu Shangwu&rsquo;s help. They already thought that it was shocking enough for Chu Feng to bet his life against Zhao Xuanhe, but right now, he was even proposing to be on the defensive side for the first round.<br>It was Zhao Xuanhe that he was facing over here!<br>With Zhao Xuanhe&rsquo;s strength, he could easily crush his opponent with his offensive formation in the first round, making it such that Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t even have a chance to attack in the second round.<br>&ldquo;Hah! Since you&rsquo;re in such a hurry to die, I&rsquo;ll fulfill your wish then!&rdquo; Zhao Xuanhe scoffed.<br>He turned to the Sagacious Grandmaster, clasped his fist, and said, &ldquo;Grandmaster, we&rsquo;re ready!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Un.&rdquo;<br>The Sagacious Grandmaster nodded his head slightly.<br>Weng!<br>Following that, the surge of energy that sealed off the dueling ring surfaced once more, and another incense stick materialized above the dueling ring.<br>Weng!<br>Weng!<br>Chu Feng and Zhao Xuanhe immediately released their spirit power and began constructing their formations.<br>&ldquo;That feeling&hellip; That young lad has actually grasped rank three Dragon Transformation Sensation too?&rdquo;<br>As soon as Chu Feng began using his spirit power, the crowd present couldn&rsquo;t keep their calm anymore.<br>Even the Eight Immortal Swordswomen of the Dao Sea and the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster were taken aback too.<br>They didn&rsquo;t expect Chu Feng to possess such capabilities.<br>For a person of the younger generation to grasp rank three Dragon Transformation Sensation was a huge deal! That would mean that his capabilities in world spirit techniques surpassed that of even Zhao Xuanhe and Liu Shangwu!<br>Of course, what they didn&rsquo;t know was that even though Chu Feng boasted great spirit power, in truth, he wasn&rsquo;t at rank three Dragon Transformation Sensation yet.<br>The main reason why he possessed such great power was due to his Nine Dragons Saint Cloak and the augmentation from his world spiritist bloodline.<br>However, it was nigh impossible to discern the exact rank of one&rsquo;s Dragon Transformation Sensation clearly.<br>Unless he were to reveal it through a Dragon Disclosure Stone or that one had exceptionally discerning eyes, otherwise one could only deduce one&rsquo;s Dragon Transformation Sensation rank through the world spiritist&rsquo;s spirit power.<br>At the very least, there were very few people present who could tell that Chu Feng&rsquo;s Dragon Transformation Sensation was still at rank two.<br></p></div>
