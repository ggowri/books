        <h1>Chapter 3852</h1>
        <div> - The Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right after they entered Chu Feng&rsquo;s residence, the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints waved his hand and released his spirit power.<br>His spirit power sealed the entire palace hall from the inside.<br>That was a grand soundproofing spirit formation. Its use was to prevent others outside from spying on the conversation inside.<br>&ldquo;Go ahead and tell me what matter you have. I&rsquo;ve already set up a protective formation around this place.&rdquo;<br>Through the actions of the Mystic Cave Saints&rsquo; Eldest, Chu Feng knew that he had not come with the intention of harming him. Instead, he most likely had something that he wanted to say to him. Otherwise, there was no need for him to set up a soundproofing spirit formation to prevent others outside from spying on their conversation.<br>&ldquo;Hehe. Seems like brother Asura is also a cautious person.&rdquo; the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints said with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better that you address me as Asura. Even &lsquo;boy&rsquo; or &lsquo;little brat&rsquo; would be better than calling me brother." said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, you&rsquo;re still angry because of what happened in the past, right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Actually, we can be considered to be people that have fought and become friends. Besides, it is us brothers who came out suffering losses every time. You&rsquo;ve never suffered any losses, thus, let us forget about the past and not be angry at each other." the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints said with a beaming smile. His attitude was extremely good. There was simply a night and day difference between his current attitude and the attitude he had displayed before.<br>&ldquo;There is nothing for me to be angry about. What matters is that you all are simply too despicable. For you to find me with a beaming smile on your face, who knows what sort of evil trick you have in your stomach.&rdquo; Chu Feng said mockingly.<br>&ldquo;Look, look. Those words of yours, I knew that you would possess prejudice against me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Actually, we brothers are not bad people. You should be able to tell from how good of a relationship we eleven possess.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will admit that we brothers are a bit greedy. Sometimes, we will try to attain our goal by hook or by crook. However, we are people with a baseline.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Whilst it is true that us Mystic Cave Saints do not have a good reputation, we&rsquo;ve never willfully slaughtered innocents. Brother Asura, you can go and ask around if us Mystic Cave Saints have done any outrageous criminal acts such as killing innocent people.&rdquo; The Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints patted his chest and spoke in a righteous manner.<br>Chu Feng had actually inquired about the Mystic Cave Saints whilst chatting with the people from the Red-dress Holy Land over the past several days.<br>He learned that the Mystic Cave Saints did not possess a fixed residence, and no one knew where they came from or their true identities.<br>Even their title &lsquo;Mystic Cave Saints,&rsquo; was something that they announced themselves.<br>They were the ones who had called themselves the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>No one knew where their so-called Mystic Cave was. The Mystic Cave Saints had also never mentioned it either.<br>The Mystic Cave Saints had only appeared three years ago.<br>However, in a mere three years, their reputation had flourished greatly, and their name was known throughout the All-heaven Starfield.<br>They were extremely famous in the All-heaven Starfield, and many people in various powers had heard of them.<br>The reason why they were so famous was because they had practically traveled throughout all of the worlds in the All-heaven Starfield. They&rsquo;d even appeared in the Ordinary Realms.<br>Of course, with how shameless they were, they&rsquo;d done all sorts of swindling and deceiving.<br>Because of that, they currently had a lot of enemies.<br>However, even with that, the Mystic Cave Saints were still living fine. Their ability to flee from situations was simply top rated. They had a lot of bizarre treasures on them.<br>Judging from that, the Mystic Cave Saints were quite capable.<br>That being said, although they were swindlers, they, like the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints declared earlier, had never done anything outrageous, and had never committed atrocities such as killing innocent people.<br>They were only known for swindling people. There had never been any rumors of them killing others for their property.<br>Thinking carefully, although Chu Feng had indeed had disagreements with the Mystic Cave Saints, and they would sometimes be so furious that they seemed like they wanted to kill him, they&rsquo;d really never held any murderous desire towards him.<br>Otherwise, with their strength, they were most definitely capable of attacking Chu Feng long ago should they have wanted to.<br>After all, their Eleventh was already a peak Exalted. Chu Feng felt that this Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints was at least an Utmost Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, you seem to greatly detest the people from the All-heaven Sect.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could you have some sort of conflict with them?&rdquo; asked the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Instead of beating around the bush, why don&rsquo;t you tell me directly what business you might have?&rdquo; Chu Feng spoke with some impatience.<br>&ldquo;Answer my question first." said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;I do not like people who are arrogant.&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;There we go. There&rsquo;s no one more arrogant than the people from the All-heaven Sect in this All-heaven Starfield. We actually also dislike them a lot.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, I am truly feeling admiration for you. That is why I came to find you today.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I am not afraid of you screwing me over. Thus, I might as well tell you things directly. I wish to cooperate with you for some big business.&rdquo; said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Big business? What sort of big business?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;According to my knowledge, the All-heaven Sect has mustered such a large force to come to the Reincarnation Upper Realm not because they wanted to come to stay as guests in the Red-dress Holy Land. They&rsquo;ve merely done so for civilities. Their true purpose is something else.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng immediately grew very interested.<br>Chu Feng already knew what the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints wanted to discuss with him.<br>It just so happened that what the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints wanted to tell him was what he wanted to know the most at that moment.<br>Thus, Chu Feng asked, &ldquo;What is their true purpose?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb." said the Mystic Cave Saints&rsquo; Eldest one word at a time in a deliberately mystifying manner.<br>&ldquo;The Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb? What sort of place is that?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Since you&rsquo;re not from the All-heaven Starfield, it is normal for you to not have heard of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Great Monster Slayer Emperor was an extremely powerful individual that appeared in the All-heaven Starfield after the Ancient Era.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;By relying on a single Monster Slaying Sword, he slew countless monsters. Because of that, he received the title of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After the Great Monster Slayer Emperor died, he was buried in the Reincarnation Upper Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;When he was alive, the Great Monster Slayer Emperor was overwhelmingly impressive. The treasures he obtained in his lifetime were simply innumerable.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, he did not leave a single treasure behind. All the treasures he had obtained in his life were buried with him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The All-heaven Sect has been eyeing the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb for many years. Through many years of effort, they&rsquo;ve gathered a great amount of treasures and methods that can open the tomb. However, they were still unable to open it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do you know why that&rsquo;s the case?&rdquo; asked the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;How could I know about that? Why don&rsquo;t you get on with it?&rdquo; Chu Feng took a glance of contempt at him.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to mystify things. Boy, why are you so dull?&rdquo; The Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints laughed mischievously. Soon after, he continued, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because they are simply unable to breach the tomb at all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Simply unable to breach the tomb at all?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If the tomb is unable to be opened, why are they trying to open it?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because the protective formation around the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb is starting to weaken." said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br></p></div>
