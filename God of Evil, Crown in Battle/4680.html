        <h1>Chapter 4679</h1>
        <div>: Relentless<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Is this how the trial goes? Interesting. Chu Feng, let this Queen deal with this fellow.&rdquo;<br>Eggy was excited to see the figure approaching hostilely, hoping to test her powers against him.<br>&ldquo;Milady Queen, you might have to wait till the next trial to try your hand,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t. This Queen is already bored to death. Leave this fellow for me to deal with. Hurry up and let me out. I want to move around a bit,&rdquo; Eggy insisted.<br>&ldquo;Milady Queen, it&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t want to let you out, but that I&rsquo;m unable to open the World Spirit Space. While I&rsquo;m able to communicate with you normally here, I can&rsquo;t use any world spiritist techniques at all,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Is that so? How boring&hellip; Be careful then. Don&rsquo;t let your guard down.&rdquo;<br>After learning the reason, Eggy didn&rsquo;t harp too much on the matter. Instead, she began advising him concernedly.<br>&ldquo;Milady Queen, you can rest assured. Don&rsquo;t you know me well? No matter who I&rsquo;m up against, I won&rsquo;t let my guard down.&rdquo;<br>Right after saying those words, Chu Feng thrust his fist forward.<br>His martial power gathered and morphed into a massive palm that smashed right toward the approaching figure.<br>The approaching figure initially had a vile smile on his lips, but as soon as Chu Feng made his move, his face immediately warped with fear. Without any hesitation, he turned around and fled.<br>But of course, there was no way Chu Feng would have allowed him to get away. His palm rushed forward at a speed so fast that it took only a second for it to strike the figure. It crushed the figure as easily as a human would kill an ant with a smack.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually this weak? This trial can&rsquo;t be this easy, right?&rdquo;<br>Eggy was surprised to see how easily Chu Feng destroyed the figure.<br>&ldquo;Of course not. It can&rsquo;t possibly be this easy.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t let his guard down just because he defeated his opponent. Instead, he turned around to face another two figures who had just appeared.<br>These two figures also had the face of a human, though it was different from the figure earlier. Their cultivation level was at rank six Utmost Exalted as well, but the aura they emanated was clearly much stronger.<br>On top of that, both of them were wielding an Incomplete Exalted Armament each.<br>Boom!<br>The surrounding space shuddered as overwhelming martial power poured forth from Chu Feng&rsquo;s palm. It morphed into a gigantic palm that struck down on the two of them unhesitatingly.<br>It was the same means that Chu Feng used to kill the first enemy.<br>This time, however, neither of the two figures cowered in the face of his attack. They brandished the Incomplete Exalted Armament in their hands in a crescent arc and forcefully smashed the palm Chu Feng formed using his martial power into shreds.<br>Even though their cultivation was also at rank six Utmost Exalted level, their strength far surpassed the first enemy.<br>Tzlala!<br>Not wanting to waste time, Chu Feng activated the Lightning Mark on his forehead, and his cultivation immediately rose to rank seven Utmost Exalted level. Then, he struck forth with his palm once more.<br>The two figures brandished their weapons once more, hoping to deal with Chu Feng&rsquo;s palm the same way as before. But this time around, their attacks weren&rsquo;t strong enough to deal with Chu Feng&rsquo;s palm anymore, so just like the figure before them, they were smashed into pieces easily.<br>It was not that they had become weaker, but it was just that Chu Feng, after raising his cultivation level by a rank, was far stronger than them. This was the absolute gap that came from a difference in rank!<br>&ldquo;How many more enemies will I have to defeat for this trial?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t particularly happy about defeating the two enemies at all. He turned his head around once more, and where the first figure had disappeared, three more had appeared.<br>These three figures were dressed in silver armor. They were all at rank six Utmost Exalted level, but there was a Lightning Mark crackling on their foreheads. In other words, their cultivation level had all been raised to rank seven Utmost Exalted level.<br>&ldquo;Come, I don&rsquo;t believe that I would be defeated in my own field!&rdquo;<br>Despite the constantly growing enemies and not knowing when the trial would come to an end, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t show any fear. Instead, he rushed forward to attack the enemy fearlessly.<br>Boom!<br>Boom!<br>Boom!<br>Explosions sounded as martial power rippled outward like a torrential wave. The earth was ravaged by the shockwaves of their clashes, and the clouds in the sky had long dispersed from the force. Even space had been destroyed and repaired multiple times.<br>It had been an hour since Chu Feng had entered this world, and he had already brought out the Lightning Mark, Lightning Armor, Four Symbols Divine Power, and all of his means. His current cultivation level had risen by three ranks to become rank nine Utmost Exalted level.<br>On top of that, he was also wielding the Immemorial Hero&rsquo;s Sword in his hand as well.<br>However, surrounded by 18 other figures, Chu Feng found himself in a terrible position.<br>Even though these 18 figures had different appearances, they were dressed in lightning armor and emanated a golden aura. Their cultivation had all reached rank nine Utmost Exalted level, and they were wielding Exalted Armaments too, same as Chu Feng. To make things worse, they had collaborated with one another to form a sword formation, trapping Chu Feng within.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no choice then.&rdquo;<br>Tzlala!<br>Chu Feng raised his Immemorial Hero&rsquo;s Sword as lightning sparked in his eyes.<br>Boom!<br>All of a sudden, the rumbling of thunder sounded as lightning began to crackle in the sky above.<br>It was a phenomenon summoned by Chu Feng.<br>The lightning immediately diffused into the surroundings like countless ferocious beasts, covering the sky as if they were attempting to devour it whole.<br>At the same time, terrifying lightning began crackling on Chu Feng&rsquo;s body and his Immemorial Hero&rsquo;s Sword too.<br>This sight made the eighteen figures jolt in fear. They sensed danger from the lightning Chu Feng had summoned.<br></p></div>
