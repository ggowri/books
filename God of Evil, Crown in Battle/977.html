        <h1>Chapter 977</h1>
        <div> - A True Monster<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>*BOOM&mdash;*<br>The speed of the Raging Flames of the Burning Heaven was extremely quick. In the instant Qiushui Fuyan entered a daze, it had already arrived. It was akin to a fiery-red enormous wave of flames, yet also like a ferocious army formed by Monstrous Beasts. With a destructive might, it arrived before Chu Feng.<br>In front of the Raging Flames of the Burning Heaven, Chu Feng was akin to an ant in a flood. He simply could not resist as he was instantly flooded by the flames.<br>Moreover, after engulfing Chu Feng, the horrifying fire did not stop. Its heat soared into the sky and as it surged, it continued towards Qiushui Fuyan and the others. This was because the flames&rsquo; goal was originally Qiushui Fuyan. She was the person Huangfu Haoyue aimed to kill.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha, ignorant brat, who do you think Huangfu Haoyue is? With this borrowed cultivation, you think you want to defeat him, a rank eight Martial King? You&rsquo;re simply committing suicide!&rdquo;<br>Seeing the Raging Flames of the Burning Heaven that enveloped the entire sky as it surged in the air, seeming as if they could burn through everything, Murong Mingtian roared with laughter. He knew how terrifying the Raging Flames of the Burning Heaven were. He knew even more how terrifying<br>Huangfu Haoyue&rsquo;s<br>Raging Flames of the Burning Heaven were.<br>The Raging Flames of the Burning Heaven could burn through all creatures in this world. Those words were not just meaningless talk. Huangfu Haoyue&rsquo;s Raging Flames of the Burning Heaven could truly do that because he had already mastered the Burning Heaven Church&rsquo;s most precious treasure, the Burning Heaven Mysterious Technique. The mark on his forehead was the proof of that.<br>So, after Chu Feng was submerged within the inferno, Murong Mingtian felt Chu Feng was absolutely dead. How could a rank four Martial King possibly defend against the Raging Flames of the Burning Heaven?<br>But in contrast to Murong Mingtian&rsquo;s secret joy, Qiushui Fuyan and Zi Ling and the others instantly fell into an icy bottomless hole. An indescribable sorrow started flowing within their hearts. They couldn&rsquo;t even make out any crying sounds but their eyes were already red.<br>They felt Chu Feng hadn&rsquo;t been able to block the ferocious Raging Flames of the Burning Heaven. Although its power was limited, they could feel it was actually much more terrifying than the Earthen Taboo martial skill Jiang Qisha cast before.<br>*boom rumble rumble rumble&mdash;*<br>However, just when everyone felt Chu Feng had possibly lost his life, a deafening explosion rang out amidst the Raging Flames of the Burning Heaven. The blazing flames themselves suddenly stopped as well as they stagnated in the air.<br>*boom* The strangest thing was after another explosion, the Raging Flames of the Burning Heaven started swirling on the spot. Moreover, they seemed to be shrinking, as if there were a black hole in the center of the sky absorbing the fierce flames.<br>Finally, the flames disappeared completely. At that moment, a person also appeared within the crowd&rsquo;s line of sight. That person was not big or large, but was very imposing. He was none other than Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng! It&rsquo;s Chu Feng! He hasn&rsquo;t died yet and not only that, he even withstood the Raging Flames of the Burning Heaven!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Heavens, how powerful is this Chu Feng? As a rank four Martial King, facing Jiang Qisha and Murong Mingtian is one thing but he&rsquo;s even able to face Huangfu Haoyue, a rank eight Martial King? Does logic no longer apply to this person?!&rdquo; The crowd was shocked when they saw that and felt great disbelief.<br>&ldquo;No, wait, look! Look at the lightning covering Chu Feng&rsquo;s body! It&rsquo;s not simple at all, and he isn&rsquo;t a rank four Martial King right now. His cultivation has risen! Right now, he&rsquo;s a rank five Martial King!&rdquo; But some sharp people discovered the changes that occurred to Chu Feng.<br>At that moment, there was a blinding lightning armour covering Chu Feng&rsquo;s body. As it surged, his aura had changed. He was now a rank five Martial King. And this&hellip; this was the origin of Chu Feng&rsquo;s confidence because rank four Martial King was not his limit.<br>&ldquo;Impossible! How is this possible?&rdquo;<br>But when Murong Mingtian saw the changes to Chu Feng, his complexion turned quite interesting.<br>Actually, he already knew Chu Feng had a technique to raise his cultivation. However, the reason he remained so fearless and confident was precisely because of the Immortal Transference Mysterious Technique.<br>He knew quite a bit about the technique, so he knew, after the using the technique to obtain another person&rsquo;s cultivation, no matter Forbidden Medicine or other methods of cultivation raising, both were useless. It was impossible to raise one&rsquo;s cultivation after using the Immortal Transference Mysterious Technique. It was impossible.<br>Yet, right now, Chu Feng was using that lightning armour to do exactly that. How could Murong Mingtian not be shocked? When Chu Feng was a rank four Martial King, he was able to defeat a rank seven Martial King. So, when Chu Feng was now a rank five Martial King, who knew whether he&rsquo;d be able to defeat Huangfu Haoyue, a rank eight Martial King?<br>&ldquo;Surprised? Indeed, I used the Immortal Transference Mysterious Technique to borrow Senior Piaomiao&rsquo;s power. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m at this rank. In such a situation, I cannot raise my cultivation by Forbidden Medicines or special martial skills.<br>&ldquo;But, I don&rsquo;t mind telling you that this lightning armour isn&rsquo;t a Forbidden Medicine, nor a martial skill. It is my own ability. It will not give me any backlash, nor any restrictions. Even the Immortal Transference Mysterious Technique cannot restrict it,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a mocking smile. He knew what Murong Mingtian was thinking, but he also knew his own ability.<br>&ldquo;What? His own power?&rdquo; Everyone was shocked again. An ability that could raise one&rsquo;s cultivation by one rank, regardless of the realm. That was really quite powerful.<br>At that instant, everyone looked at Chu Feng with fiery gazes. They finally knew why Chu Feng was so monstrous. This person did not seem like a normal person. At least, judging by his lightning armour ability, Chu Feng grasped something that others did not have.<br>&ldquo;Hmph. You can raise your cultivation. So what? You have powerful fighting strength, but does Huangfu Haoyue not? You are the genius in the Eastern Sea Region right now, but when Huangfu Haoyue was famous you were still in your mother&rsquo;s womb!&rdquo;<br>Although he felt it was quite inconceivable, Murong Mingtian was not too afraid. He pointed at Chu Feng, and loudly said, &ldquo;Kill this brat! It doesn&rsquo;t matter what you use, but I want to see nothing remaining!&rdquo;<br>*BOOM&mdash;*<br>After Murong Mingtian spoke, Huangfu Haoyue once again attacked. Again, it was the Raging Flames of the Burning Heaven, but this time, no matter area or fierceness, it was several times more horrifying that before.<br>Even though the observers were quite far away, they still felt the heat wave slam over from afar. It was very difficult to withstand, and they couldn&rsquo;t help but retreat. The flames were really too terrifying, and before such a blazing temperature, even if the flames were far away, they were still enough to burn them into ashes. Huangfu Haoyue was serious now.<br></p></div>
