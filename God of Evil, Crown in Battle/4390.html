        <h1>Chapter 4389</h1>
        <div>: It&rsquo;s Him!<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster didn&rsquo;t watch the fight between Chu Feng and Zhao Xuanhe to the very end. He was too worried about the situation with the treasure that he had already followed Ordinary to the entrance of the ancient castle, where the other elders and disciples were waiting.<br>It was just that as soon as he met them, the crease on his forehead tightened even further.<br>Even though these elders and disciples were still dressed in the uniforms of the Soaring Flower Gazebo, their skin had somehow turned into something that resembled a toad, making them look like monstrous beasts.<br>It was no wonder why they would be kept out of the ancient castle. Given their appearance, it would be hard to believe that they were elders and disciples of the Soaring Flower Gazebo.<br>Even if they had sufficiently high standing, it was unlikely that they would be let in.<br>Nevertheless, the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster was still able to recognize them through their demeanor.<br>&ldquo;What happened to you all? How did you land in such a state?&rdquo; the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster asked hurriedly.<br>He had already realized that something huge had cropped up while he was away.<br>It would be one thing if it had only been the elders and the disciples, but if even the Supreme Elder was reduced to such a state too, this thing was definitely something that he needed to be concerned about.<br>&ldquo;Sectmaster, we&hellip; have betrayed your trust in us!&rdquo; the Supreme Elder cried out upon seeing the sectmaster.<br>He was the lofty Supreme Elder of the Soaring Flower Gazebo, a figure who had lived for more than ten thousand years. He would be able to keep his calm no matter what happened usually, so what kind of grievances could he have encountered to actually cry in public?<br>To make things worse, the Supreme Elder wasn&rsquo;t the only one who cried. The other elders and disciples quickly joined in as well, creating quite a cacophony.<br>&ldquo;What are you crying for? Hurry up and tell me what happened!&rdquo; the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster urged anxiously.<br>His anxiety stemmed from two reasons.<br>One, he was worried about the plight of the treasure.<br>Two, he wanted to rush back in to see his personal disciple, Zhao Xuanhe, defeat Chu Feng.<br>Right now, given what he was seeing before him, it was almost certain that something had happened to the treasure. So, he wanted to quickly learn about what had happened before heading back in to continue watching the battle.<br>Hearing those words, the Supreme Elder of the Soaring Flower Gazebo immediately summarized everything that had happened for the sectmaster.<br>Aside from what they had encountered in the mountain range concerning Chu Feng, they had also met with another incident.<br>After Chu Feng made away with the treasure, they quickly made up their mind to head over to this city to report the matter to the sectmaster. However, who could have thought that they would end up falling into a formation on their way here.<br>That formation was incredibly terrifying. They had suffered far greater pain than anything they had faced in their entire lifetime. It was a trauma and humiliation that was deeply imprinted into their soul.<br>It was also due to that that they arrived here later than Chu Feng, as well as why the Supreme Elder would cry upon seeing the sectmaster.<br>He had never undergone anything like this in his lifetime before, and it would likely haunt him for his entire life.<br>&ldquo;Do you know who the culprit is?&rdquo; the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster asked.<br>If it was just someone of the younger generation, it could still be resolved easily. They could simply hunt the other party down and exact vengeance.<br>But if even the Supreme Elder had ended up getting done in and trapped in the formation, their opponent could be more than just a mere junior.<br>After all, how could a mere junior possibly be a match for the Supreme Elder?<br>&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t sure either. No one saw the person who set up the formation. The formation was very strong, such that we couldn&rsquo;t sense anyone&rsquo;s aura inside either. The culprit could have killed us with the formation, but he didn&rsquo;t do so. He simply tortured and violated us&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Speaking up to this point, the Supreme Elder and the others seemed to become even sadder.<br>&ldquo;You all are really&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster trembled in rage.<br>It was only in view that the servant of the Sagacious Grandmaster, Ordinary, was around that he was trying his darnest best to hold back his rage.<br>Had there been no outsiders around, he would have definitely punished the elders and dsicipels of the Soaring Flower Gazebo by now regardless of whether they were at fault or not.<br>From his point of view, he had given them a mission and they had failed it, and that was a sin in itself.<br>&ldquo;Cough cough.&rdquo;<br>All of a sudden, the sound of someone coughing sounded from behind. It was from Ordinary.<br>&ldquo;Sectmaster Xu, your disciple has lost. I advise you to put aside any problems you are facing right now and return to the ancient castle for the time being. It would be disastrous for you if the other party killed your disciple,&rdquo; Ordinary said.<br>&ldquo;What? You are saying that&hellip; Xuanhe lost the battle?&rdquo;<br>The eyes of the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster widened in disbelief.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Ordinary nodded in response.<br>Seeing how certain Ordinary was of the matter, the face of the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster warped in shock.<br>How could this be possible? How could his disciple have lost the battle?<br>As much as he didn&rsquo;t believe it, he still rushed right back into the ancient castle, leaving behind the elders and disciples of the Soaring Flower Gazebo at the entrance.<br>At this very moment, they were at a loss as to what they should do.<br>&ldquo;You should enter too,&rdquo; Ordinary suddenly said.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, Milord.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the elders and disciples of the Soaring Flower Gazebo quickly made their way in.<br>They, too, were curious about what had happened inside the ancient castle.<br>&hellip;<br>Aside from the Sagacious Grandmaster, every single person inside the ancient castle had shocked looks on their faces.<br>It had been a while since Chu Feng had defeated Zhao Xuanhe, but no one amidst the crowd was able to recover from the shock yet.<br>In fact, even the blind Liu Shangwu had his mouth widened in astonishment.<br>He had known that Chu Feng&rsquo;s mastery of world spiritist techniques was above his, but he didn&rsquo;t think that the latter would be so skilled as to set up such an ingenious formation.<br>Until the formation finally released that tremendous outburst of energy, he was fooled by the exterior of the defensive formation too. He honestly believed that the defensive formation Chu Feng had set up was indeed that weak.<br>However, the one who was the most shocked at the moment was not the Eight Immortal Swordswomen of the Dao Sea, Liu Shangwu, or anyone from the other powers.<br>It was the master of Zhao Xuanhe, the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>He had returned to the ancient castle carrying some skepticism regarding what Ordinary had said, but when he saw the severely injured Zhao Xuanhe lying by the side of the dueling ring and a completely unharmed Chu Feng standing not too far away, he had no choice but to accept it.<br>Just what in the world happened?<br>Zhao Xuanhe clearly had the advantage when he left! How did the tables turn on him within the short period of time that he was away?<br>&ldquo;Sectmaster!!!&rdquo;<br>All of a sudden, loud exclamations sounded from behind. It was from the elders and disciples of the Soaring Flower Gazebo.<br>Their exclamations immediately caught the attention of everyone present.<br>When the crowd saw the disfigured looks of the bunch from the Soaring Flower Gazebo, they pointed at them with horrified looks.<br>&ldquo;What do you think you are doing kicking a big fuss here?&rdquo;<br>The Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster immediately turned around and berated his people.<br>He was already in a bad mood as it was, but these elders and disciples were still shouting around and bringing shame to his name. He was beginning to lose control of his emotions.<br>&ldquo;Sectmaster, that guy&hellip; He&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The guest elder of the Soaring Flower Gazebo pointed at Chu Feng with a trembling body. He was so agitated that he couldn&rsquo;t even finish his sentence.<br>&ldquo;What about him? Hurry up and spit it out!&rdquo; the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster said impatiently.<br>&ldquo;Sectmaster, he&rsquo;s the one who killed our disciples, nearly assimilated our guest elder to death, and stole our treasure!&rdquo; the Supreme Elder exclaimed out loud.<br></p></div>
