        <div> - The Astonishing Truth<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Lord Youyuan, thank you,&rdquo; That member of the younger generation was extremely grateful to be saved by Lord Youyuan.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good that you&rsquo;re fine,&rdquo; Lord Youyuan said with a faint smile.<br>&ldquo;Wuu~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right at that moment, the smile on Lord Youyuan&rsquo;s face instantly turned stiff. Then, his expression changed enormously, and he violently tossed that member of the younger generation away.<br>Lord Youyuan&rsquo;s throw held enormous strength. It would be sufficient to crush that young man to death on impact.<br>However, that young man merely flipped his body in midair, and was then standing on the ground.<br>At that moment, that young man&rsquo;s aura was actually also that of a rank two Exalted.<br>As for Lord Youyuan, he was moving back repeatedly. Then, with a &lsquo;puu,&rsquo; a mouthful of blood sprayed out.<br>&ldquo;Lord Youyuan!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was immediately worried upon seeing this scene.<br>He discovered that Lord Youyuan&rsquo;s chest had been pierced through. It was that wound that had caused Lord Youyuan to become so weak.<br>As for the person that caused that wound, it was that member of the younger generation Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather had captured to threaten Lord Youyuan earlier.<br>It turned out that apart from Chu Feng, Chu Ruoshi and Chu Zhiyuan, the two other people of the younger generation there were also not their original selves.<br>Their bodies were both seized by others. They were two rank two Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; After being injured, Lord Youyuan arrived before Chu Feng and smiled at him.<br>Seeing Lord Youyuan like that, Chu Feng felt distressed.<br>He was able to tell that Lord Youyuan&rsquo;s current injury was not a small matter; he was seriously injured.<br>However, even though he was already injured, Lord Youyuan still deliberately came over to appease him, fearing that he would worry.<br>After appeasing Chu Feng, Lord Youyuan turned his gaze to that person of the younger generation he had saved earlier.<br>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Lord Youyuan asked.<br>&ldquo;Chu Youyuan, oh Chu Youyuan, I bet you must&rsquo;ve never thought that we had this trick up our sleeve, no?&rdquo; That person said with a smile on his face.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you?!!!&rdquo; Hearing that man&rsquo;s voice, Lord Youyuan felt very astonished. However, it was clear that he had already discovered who that person of the younger generation really was.<br>&ldquo;Lord Youyuan, exactly who is he?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked. The reason why Chu Feng wanted to know who that person was was because he knew that since that person had also seized the life of a member from the younger generation like Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather and entered that place with him, they must possess the same purpose.<br>Both of them wanted to eliminate him.<br>Thus, Chu Feng actually wanted to know exactly who it was that wanted to eliminate him.<br>&ldquo;Perhaps you might not know him well, but you must&rsquo;ve heard about his grandfather,&rdquo; Lord Youyuan looked to Chu Zhiyuan, who stood nearby.<br>&ldquo;Chu Zhiyuan&rsquo;s grandfather? That man is Chu Zhiyuan&rsquo;s grandfather?&rdquo; Chu Feng felt very astonished.<br>The reason why Chu Feng was so shocked was because he had clearly heard that Chu Zhiyuan&rsquo;s grandfather was not only their Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder, but he was also a very good-natured Supreme Elder.<br>He was even deemed to be one of the most good-natured Supreme Elders of the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Furthermore, Chu Zhiyuan&rsquo;s grandfather was said to be someone who would only handle major matters within the clan. Not only would he be very impartial and fair, but he would also never use his identity and status to suppress others.<br>In fact, he would not even care when his grandson Chu Zhiyuan was bullied and ridiculed by others. That was the only reason why the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations dared to ridicule Chu Zhiyuan with no fear.<br>However, that Supreme Elder who was rumored to possess an enormously good moral character was now not only acting with Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather, but he had also injured Lord Youyuan and taken the life of a person from the younger generation to enter that place.<br>As for his purpose, it was to eliminate Chu Feng.<br>As such, how could Chu Feng not be surprised?<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you should now know why I declared earlier that you would definitely die here, right?&rdquo;<br>Chu Zhiyuan walked behind his grandfather. He had an extremely complacent expression on his face.<br>It would appear that he knew about all of this beforehand. It was no wonder he would be so confident from the very start.<br>Two of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elders were backing him up; how could he not be confident?<br>&ldquo;Chu Youyuan, you must&rsquo;ve never thought that the two of us would join hands, right?&rdquo; Right at that moment, the voice of Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather was heard. He had walked back in from the direction of the entrance and stood next to Chu Zhiyuan&rsquo;s grandfather.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d nearly forgotten that he was also someone who was humiliated by Chu Haoxian.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I originally thought that he had forgotten about the humiliation he had received back then. It would appear that I was careless,&rdquo; Lord Youyuan smiled bitterly and shook his head. There was a trace of regret on his face.<br>&ldquo;No, no, no, this old man is not someone that holds a grudge. Chu Hanxian indeed humiliated me before. However, that&rsquo;s in the past,&rdquo; Chu Zhiyuan&rsquo;s grandfather shook his head.<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, then why have you joined hands with him to kill Chu Feng?&rdquo; Lord Youyuan asked. It would appear that he wanted to know the answer very much.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because I possess the same purpose as him. Both of us are determined to kill Chu Feng,&rdquo; Chu Zhiyuan&rsquo;s grandfather said.<br>&ldquo;Since you&rsquo;ve declared you&rsquo;re not holding a grudge, then why are you trying to kill him?&rdquo; Lord Youyuan asked.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, I hold no grudge against him. However&hellip; I want my grandson to excel among his peers. That Chu Feng has simply succeeded his grandfather Chu Hanxian and his father Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s talents perfectly.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Back then, we were suppressed to a state of being unable to raise our heads by Chu Hanxian. I do not wish for my grandson to suffer the same fate as myself, and be suppressed to the point where he is unable to raise his head by Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, I have no choice other than to eliminate Chu Feng,&rdquo; Chu Zhiyuan&rsquo;s grandfather said.<br>&ldquo;You all&hellip; you are all blood clansmen. Regardless of who is stronger or weaker, you are all our clan&rsquo;s glories. Why do you insist on seeking selfish profit with no regards for others like this?&rdquo; Lord Youyuan spoke in a very resentful manner.<br>&ldquo;There has never been a saying of enjoying glories and disgrace together in the Chu Heavenly Clan. Only the strongest will be able to enjoy honor and glory,&rdquo; Chu Zhiyuan&rsquo;s grandfather said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Puze, even if you kill Chu Feng, Chu Zhiyuan will suppress your grandson, Chu Haoyan. Are you certain that you want to join hands with him?&rdquo; Lord Youyuan said to Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather.<br>&ldquo;Youyuan, oh Youyuan, if you&rsquo;re trying to sow dissension, then you should forget about it. We have already reached a common understanding before coming here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I admit that I also wish for my grandson to become the strongest in the Chu Heavenly Clan. However, compared to that, my desire to kill Chu Hanxian&rsquo;s grandson, Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son, is even greater,&rdquo; Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather said.<br>&ldquo;You all!!!&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Lord Youyuan&rsquo;s complexion turned incomparably pale. Then, he opened his mouth and sprayed out another mouthful of blood.<br>It was from anger. He had been angered to a state of vomiting blood.<br>He had truly never imagined that those two, for the sake of their own selfish motives, would do such things.<br>One should know that the two of them were their Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elders.<br>&ldquo;Chu Youyuan, you shouldn&rsquo;t have come here today. However, since you&rsquo;ve come, do not blame us for not taking our old friendship into consideration. You will die here together with Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Clank~~~&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, a golden spear appeared in Chu Zhiyuan&rsquo;s grandfather&rsquo;s hand. It was an Immortal Armament.<br>Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather also started to fiddle with the Immortal Armament blade in his hand. He started to look to Lord Youyuan with a pitying gaze.<br>Two rank two Exalted joining hands against a seriously injured Chu Youyuan.<br>They felt that they would definitely be able to win. <br></p></div>
