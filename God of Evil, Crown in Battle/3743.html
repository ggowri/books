        <h1>Chapter 3742</h1>
        <div> - Chu Feng Being Suppressed<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Actually, Exalted Heavenly Fate was not a narrow-minded individual. In fact, he didn&rsquo;t possess any antipathy for Chu Feng.<br>Otherwise, when he prophesied the fated battle, he would not have deliberately concealed it.<br>In fact, his decision to deliberately reveal the outcome of the prophecy was so that Chu Feng would back away.<br>In the end, Exalted Heavenly Fate was a kindhearted person. He was not someone with evil desires.<br>However, there was one thing that Exalted Heavenly Fate could not tolerate - his prophecies being called into question.<br>To Exalted Heavenly Fate, his prophecies were his firm belief, something that he refused to allow anyone to blaspheme.<br>Chu Feng seemed to know what Exalted Heavenly Fate was thinking. Thus, he did not provoke Exalted Heavenly Fate, and was instead merely attacking his so-called prophecy.<br>Chu Feng did not believe in the prophecy because he refused to resign himself to fate.<br>That said, Chu Feng actually also held respect for Exalted Heavenly Fate.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you are truly one to refuse to shed a tear until you witness your coffin,&rdquo; Linghu Hongfei said to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;For things like prophecies, I might believe them if they&rsquo;re said about other people. However, if the prophecy is about me, I will not believe it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason for that is because I, Chu Feng, am the only person who gets to decide my fate.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I had resigned myself to fate, I would not be standing here today.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Instead, I would remain an unremarkable outer sect disciple in a second-rate sect in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm," Chu Feng said with a faint smile.<br>Hearing those words, the people present were all startled. They seemed to have thought of something.<br>Even the Chu Heavenly Clansmen reacted in such a manner. A feeling of self-blame appeared in their hearts.<br>This was especially true for the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. Deep shame appeared on his face.<br>Chu Feng came from a Lower Realm. On his journey, he had naturally experienced countless tribulations and dangers.<br>He did not grow up protected by his clan. Instead, he had relied on himself and killed his way up, one step at a time.<br>If he had resigned himself to fate, he would not be standing before them.<br>&ldquo;Very well spoken. Since that&rsquo;s the case, I will take your life today.&rdquo;<br>As Linghu Hongfei spoke, he took a step forward and attacked Chu Feng.<br>The distance between him and Chu Feng was extremely close to begin with. Thus, his attack arrived at Chu Feng in an instant.<br>He did not use any special technique. Instead, he was purely attacking Chu Feng with his fists and feet.<br>However, his punches were akin to iron hammers capable of splitting open mountains, and his kicks were akin to iron whips capable of sweeping through space itself.<br>His entire body was akin to the devastating destructive power of weapons. If struck by any of them, one would either be killed or seriously injured.<br>That said, Chu Feng was no ordinary individual either.<br>He did not attempt to dodge Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s ferocious attacks. Instead, he continued to take steps forward to confront Linghu Hongfei.<br>&ldquo;Clank, clank, clank~~~&rdquo;<br>Even though the two of them were clearly made of flesh and bones, their collision created sounds akin to steel colliding.<br>Both Chu Feng and Linghu Hongfei possessed top rated battle power. Neither their speed nor their strength differed much.<br>The two of them fought back and forth in a stalemate.<br>&ldquo;Amazing! Sure enough, the two of them are the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s top geniuses.&rdquo;<br>Seeing the battle between Chu Feng and Linghu Hongfei, the crowd were unable to help but think back to the earlier battle between Chu Lingxi and Linghu Hongfei.<br>At the beginning, the two of them were both rank four Exalted. However, Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s attacks were easily dodged by Linghu Hongfei.<br>Even though Linghu Hongfei was not injured by Chu Feng, the two of them were at least exchanging blows.<br>Although Chu Feng was unable to cause any injuries to Linghu Hongfei, Linghu Hongfei was also unable to cause any harm to Chu Feng.<br>Their confrontation was different from the confrontation between Chu Lingxi and Linghu Hongfei, where Linghu Hongfei managed to defeat her with only his oppressive might.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng&rsquo;s battle power seems to have increased again.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Or could it be, he actually really held himself back so much when he sparred with me back then?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi spoke quietly as she looked at the battle between Chu Feng and Linghu Hongfei.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s most likely that his battle power has strengthened,&rdquo; said Gu Mingyuan, who stood beside her.<br>&ldquo;Mother, how are you so certain?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi asked.<br>&ldquo;Linghu Hongfei has gone through some sort of unknown transformation. You&rsquo;ve fought against him before, you should&rsquo;ve sensed it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;And now, such a transformation has also appeared on Chu Feng. Although I don't know what he has experienced, it remains that he has become much stronger,&rdquo; said Gu Mingyuan.<br>&ldquo;In other words, the gap between myself and that guy has increased again?&rdquo;<br>Chu Lingxi looked towards Chu Feng again. Her gaze became complicated.<br>That said, she would not wish for Chu Feng to become weaker just because he had become stronger than her.<br>On the contrary, she only wished for him to become more powerful. She wanted him to be stronger than what she saw, stronger than she could imagine.<br>Only in that way would he be able to defeat the unfathomably powerful Linghu Hongfei.<br>&ldquo;That said, it seems like Chu Feng is on the verge of losing.&rdquo;<br>As the two of them continued to fight, the crowd discovered that the battle between the two was no longer equal. The scale of victory was tipping towards Linghu Hongfei.<br>Even though his attacks were either blocked or dodged by Chu Feng, even though Chu Feng was still completely uninjured, he was beginning to show difficulty.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that there&rsquo;s still a disparity between them.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that Chu Feng was beginning to gradually retreat, showing signs of defeat and being suppressed by Linghu Hongfei, the crowd began to feel that Exalted Heavenly Fate&rsquo;s prophecy might come true.<br>Even though Chu Feng was very powerful, Linghu Hongfei was, unfortunately, even stronger.<br>&ldquo;Should I take care of him?&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng was retreating, a voice suddenly entered his ears.<br>That voice was not a voice transmission. However, only Chu Feng could hear it.<br>The reason for that was because that voice came from his world spirit space.<br>&ldquo;Girl, you&rsquo;ve awoken?&rdquo;<br>Focused on his battle against Linghu Hongfei, Chu Feng was not paying any attention to his world spirit space.<br>However, he suddenly discovered that that girl Yu Sha had finally completed her training, and had woken up.<br>Furthermore, that girl had gained a certain harvest. Her cultivation had reached rank four Exalted.<br>She had made three successive breakthroughs. This sort of harvest could be said to be enormous.<br>&ldquo;Never would I have imagined that little natural oddity would provide so much help to you.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt extremely joyous. He had never expected that his unexpected harvest would help Yu Sha so much.<br>After all, that girl was an existence that possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation.<br>Furthermore, she was able to summon a black warhorse. With that warhorse, she was able to increase her heaven-defying battle power by another level for a total of four levels of cultivation.<br>Back then, that girl had relied precisely on her heaven-defying battle power to fight Linghu Hongfei, then a rank two Exalted, to a tie with only the cultivation of a rank one Exalted.<br>&ldquo;I see that you&rsquo;re having some difficulty taking him on. Why don&rsquo;t you have me take care of him?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You can consider it my thanks for helping me obtain that cultivation resource,&rdquo; said Yu Sha.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m actually being underestimated. Girl&hellip; today, I will have you witness how strong I, your master, am.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Clank~~~&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he flipped his wrist, and an Incomplete Exalted Armament appeared in his hand.<br>With the Incomplete Exalted Armament in hand, Chu Feng&rsquo;s battle power immediately increased enormously. Previously being suppressed, he immediately turned the situation around.<br></p></div>
