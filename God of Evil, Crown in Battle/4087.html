        <h1>Chapter 4086</h1>
        <div> - Demonization<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Chu Feng is actually this powerful?!&rdquo;<br>While the scene before their eyes was something that the crowd had anticipated to be possible, they still felt disbelief upon witnessing it.<br>While they knew that Chu Feng possessed overwhelming battle power, they did not expect it to really be so strong that even the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master going all-out would not be a match for him.<br>He was able to defeat the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master&rsquo;s rank two Exalted Taboo Martial Skill using only his world spirit techniques.<br>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the person who felt the most complicated would be none other than the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master.<br>The Exalted Taboo: Purple Lightning Attachment was his strongest technique.<br>If even that was unable to defeat Chu Feng...<br>Then not only would he be killed, but his Constellation Immortal Isle would also be wiped out.<br>Thinking of that, the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master revealed a look of determination.<br>&ldquo;You all! Quickly, leave this place!&rdquo; He looked at his subordinates that had hidden themselves far away.<br>&ldquo;Lord Isle Master, could you be&hellip;?!&rdquo;<br>Seeing the look in their Isle Master&rsquo;s eyes, they suddenly realized something.<br>&ldquo;Lord Isle Master, you absolutely mustn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Isle Master, if the green mountain remains, there&rsquo;s no need to fear for a lack of firewood. You mustn&rsquo;t take this step!&rdquo;<br>The people from the Constellation Immortal Isle began to plead tearfully.<br>&ldquo;Scram now!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you still don&rsquo;t scram, I&rsquo;ll slaughter you all!&rdquo; the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master shouted angrily.<br>His killing intent actually enveloped the people from the Constellation Immortal Isle.<br>He was not joking around. If his subordinates refused to leave, he would really kill them.<br>Seeing that, the people from the Constellation Immortal Isle, although they were unwilling, did not hesitate to choose their lives when given the choice between their lives and their loyalty.<br>Because of that, the people from the Constellation Immortal Isle all began to flee further away.<br>After his subordinates fled, the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master finally turned his gaze to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, to be able to force this old man into this state, you have some skills.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, it&rsquo;s all going to end now. That said, before your death, I can allow you to die with understanding,&rdquo; said the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master.<br>&ldquo;Oh? What are you trying to say?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I said that I&rsquo;ll wipe out your Chu Heavenly Clan. Thus, I will definitely wipe out your Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, you don&rsquo;t have to feel sad after you die; your clansmen will soon go down to join you.&rdquo;<br>After the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master finished saying those words, he flipped his palm, and a black stone appeared in his hand.<br>Seeing that stone, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed.<br>Chu Feng stopped holding back, and began to focus his all to control the giant light dragon and make it attack the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master.<br>Chu Feng noticed that the stone was no small matter.<br>Whilst that stone was not a forbidden medicine, it possessed a power akin to a forbidden medicine. Merely, the power it contained was much stronger than that of a forbidden medicine.<br>Chu Feng felt that the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master had taken out that stone at this impasse because he wanted to put forth a final life and death struggle against him.<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t know exactly what sort of power the black stone possessed.<br>But, to prevent the unexpected, he felt the need to strike preemptively, and not give the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master the opportunity to use the black stone.<br>But, when Chu Feng attempted to erase the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master with his giant dragon of light, the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master&rsquo;s giant lightning dragon tangled itself onto Chu Feng&rsquo;s giant light dragon.<br>Even though the light dragon held absolute superiority over the lightning dragon, eliminating the lightning dragon was not something that could be done in a short period of time.<br>While all of this was happening, a &lsquo;snap&rsquo; was heard. The Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master had crushed the stone in his hand.<br>The shattered stone then turned into dark black gaseous flames that revolved around his hand.<br>Then, with a deep breath, the black gaseous flames were sucked into the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master&rsquo;s mouth.<br>&ldquo;Eeeahhh~~~&rdquo;<br>Once the black gaseous flames entered his body, the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master began to scream miserably.<br>His current appearance was simply tragic to look at.<br>His skin was disintegrating. His face began to rip. It was those black gaseous flames. The black flames were erupting from his body, destroying it in the process.<br>Soon, the black flames began to fuse together, and actually restored the appearance of the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master.<br>Merely, the current Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master was three times the size he was before.<br>Not only that, but his body was still enveloped by black gaseous flames. Even his eyes had turned pitch-black.<br>He no longer resembled a human. Instead, he looked more like a demon.<br>&ldquo;Could that be one of the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s strongest techniques, the Constellation Immortal Technique&rsquo;s apex realm, Demonization?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In other words, the stone fragment he absorbed earlier was the item that could allow him to attain Demonization?!&rdquo;<br>Someone cried out in alarm.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Demonization?&rdquo;<br>The crowd were all greatly alarmed upon hearing those words.<br>The Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Constellation Immortal Technique was a very powerful mysterious technique.<br>It was through the use of his Constellation Immortal Technique that the Isle Master was able to gain such strong battle power.<br>It was also because of his Constellation Immortal Technique that he could defeat the six overlords.<br>However, the Constellation Immortal Technique he trained in had only reached the master level, and not the apex level.<br>There were two different sorts of apex levels for the Constellation Immortal Technique. They were Immortalization and Demonization.<br>In the entire history of the Constellation Immortal Isle, only their first Isle Master had ever managed to master the Constellation Immortal Technique to the Immortalization state.<br>After him, no one else had been able to reach Immortalization.<br>That said, a few had managed to reach Demonization.<br>Being one of the two apex forms of the Constellation Immortal Technique, the power of Demonization was actually a bit stronger than Immortalization.<br>The only difference between them was that Immortalization was something that one needed to train to obtain. Unless one possessed sufficient talent, it was impossible to reach Immortalization.<br>However, it was different for Demonization.<br>Demonization was not an apex that could be trained toward. Instead, one needed to use special medicines to obtain it.<br>However, that special medicine was even fiercer than forbidden medicines.<br>Whilst the backlash from forbidden medicines was very strong, one could find ways to lessen or completely stop it.<br>However, if one were to take the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Demonization medicine, then whilst it would be possible for the user to obtain Demonization temporarily, they would ultimately die.<br>Originally, the crowd did not understand why the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master would swallow the crushed stone.<br>However, they now understood the reason why. Seeing his current appearance, everyone knew what had happened.<br>The stone must be the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s medicine that could allow one to obtain Demonization.<br>It was no wonder the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master had ordered his subordinates to withdraw from this place, but was met with such unwillingness.<br>Evidently, they knew what the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master was planning to do.<br>Truth was, the crowd could understand why the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master would do such a thing.<br>Chu Feng was simply too strong. He was so strong that the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master was unable to defeat him even with a rank two Exalted Taboo.<br>Chu Feng was determined to kill him. Thus, this left the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master with no choice. He had to either win, or die.<br>Even though using the medicine to obtain Demonization would ultimately result in his death, he would at least be able to kill Chu Feng before he died.<br></p></div>
