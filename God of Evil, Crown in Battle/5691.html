        <h1>Chapter 5691: An Important Announcement</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the Saint-tier elders arrived too. Their appearance showed how highly the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion regarded the initiation ceremony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last two people to arrive were the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master and the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s </span><span>Sectmaster</span><span>. Everyone&rsquo;s eyes were on them as they flitted over from the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they descended on the ground, the world spiritists respectfully bowed down to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s </span><span>Sectmaster</span><span> waved his hand like an amicable elder, but Chu Feng knew that looks were deceiving. That old man was old enough to be Xia Xingchen&rsquo;s great-great-great-great-great-great grandfather, yet he shamelessly wanted to marry her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng was anxious when he saw the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s </span><span>Sectmaster</span><span>, fearful that the latter might have heard about how he helped Xia Xingchen escape from the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But on second thought, he didn&rsquo;t think that news could have spread that fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he had expected, the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s </span><span>Sectmaster</span><span> showed no signs of hostility when looking at him. On the contrary, there was an amicable smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng responded with a smile of his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>You beast in clothes. Who would have known that an old pervert is hidden beneath that dignified exterior?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master descended into his seat before directing a glance at Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> immediately flew onto the stage and started with pleasantries before announcing the names of those who would join the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. A few elders flew onto the stage to present the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s world spiritist cloaks and tokens to Chu Feng and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the formality was completed, Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> waited for the elders to leave the stage before taking out a treasure box, saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be announcing the champion of the entrance examination now.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused for dramatic effect before suddenly a smile crept onto his lips, and he continued, &ldquo;Most of you may have guessed who the champion is. He is none other than the new star of our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, Chu Feng!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thunderous applause broke out in the square.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those around Chu Feng excitedly offered their congratulations to him. These were the lofty world spiritists from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. Chu Feng might just have been moved if he had not seen their true faces, but now, he just felt disgusted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> walked up to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Congratulations, Chu Feng.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Thank you, elder,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with an earnest bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn&rsquo;t know what kind of person Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> truly was, but at least he appeared to be a good person thus far. He accepted the box from Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> and opened it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within it was another box and a token.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inscribed in front of the token were the words &lsquo;Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;, and on its back was the words &lsquo;Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Rising Star&rsquo;. It was made out of a special material, and it was an important symbol of authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Chu Feng ignored the token and instead opened the box. The item inside the box looked ordinary, but it emanated a unique fragrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart was finally put at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the Seven Realms Soul Forging Incense, the key to saving Eggy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surroundings fell absolutely silent. The person who had just called Chu Feng was none other than the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Yes, I am here.&rdquo; Chu Feng quickly stowed away the box before bowing to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Congratulations on joining our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. You are talented, but there&rsquo;s still a lot for you to work on. Don&rsquo;t let your accomplishment get to your head,&rdquo; the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Rest assured, Lord Mansion Master. I won&rsquo;t get complacent,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good to hear.&rdquo; The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master nodded. &ldquo;I shall now assign to Chu Feng his first mission as a member of our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;A mission? So fast?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other candidates joining the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion looked at Chu Feng </span><span>in envy, as they wanted to flaunt their skills too. They saw such treatment as an honor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Mission?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng was delighted to hear that. What better reason was there for him to leave the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion than to take on a mission?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;This mission is challenging.&rdquo; The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion shifted his gaze from Chu Feng to the others. &ldquo;Before that, I&rsquo;d like to announce something today. This concerns a prodigy from our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. It&rsquo;s my daughter, Jie </span><span>Ranqing</span><span>.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart shuddered. A commotion broke out in the crowd too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jie </span><span>Ranqing</span><span> was such a distant yet familiar name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no one who hadn&rsquo;t heard about Jie </span><span>Ranqing&rsquo;s</span><span> amazing feat, but she had gone into closed-door training for so long that it had been many years since anyone last heard about her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was Jie </span><span>Ranqing</span><span> finally coming out of closed-door training today?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was big news!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Ranqing</span><span> was both a fortune and a misfortune,&rdquo; the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master suddenly said with a sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd fell deathly silent. They could tell that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master was driving at something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was something off here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the shocked and curious gazes of the crowd, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master said, &ldquo;Actually, </span><span>Ranqing</span><span> isn&rsquo;t in closed-door training.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd&rsquo;s curiosity deepened. They could tell that there was more to this matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I imprisoned </span><span>Ranqing</span><span>,&rdquo; the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Imprisoned?&rdquo; The crowd was dumbstruck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jie </span><span>Ranqing</span><span> was the daughter whom the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master doted on the most. They would have never thought that the latter would imprison her. What in the world would have prompted him to do something like that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was even more curious now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You must be wondering why I imprisoned </span><span>Ranqing</span><span>. It&rsquo;s my fault. I doted on </span><span>Ranqing</span><span> so much that I failed to guide her properly on matters aside from her cultivation. As a result, she&rsquo;s an innocent child despite her formidable talents as a world spiritist. That gave that despicable thing a chance to get to her,&rdquo; the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master said lividly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd began whispering amongst themselves as they sensed that there was going to be a twist in the story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Ranqing</span><span> was duped by a scoundrel of low birth,&rdquo; the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng felt his anger surge. He knew whom that scoundrel was referring to.</span></p></div>
