        <h1>Chapter 4657</h1>
        <div>: Asura King Palace<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Chu Feng, that old beast is a vicious man. There&rsquo;s no way he has good intentions at heart. You must be wary of him!&rdquo; Wang Yuxian warned Chu Feng.<br>Over the last few days, she had been constantly tortured by Lord Yunliang, such that she couldn&rsquo;t bring herself to trust him despite his &lsquo;act of goodwill&rsquo; today.<br>And in truth, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t trust Lord Yunliang either. However, what other choice did he have right now?<br>Even though the evil spirits here weren&rsquo;t skilled in formations, this very Asura Graveyard was built using an incredibly powerful formation. This formation was so powerful that it was able to stifle the power of the teleportation formation inside Chu Feng&rsquo;s body, preventing him from leaving together with her.<br>On top of that, Lord Yunliang was an elusive figure who could appear anywhere as and when he liked. Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t even tell whether that man was spying on them at the moment, so he wouldn&rsquo;t dare to bring Wang Yuxian back the same path he took.<br>Thus, he had no choice but to follow Lord Yunliang&rsquo;s instructions.<br>Wang Yuxian was in a very frail state at the moment due to losing too much of her bloodline power. Chu Feng could stabilize her condition for the time being, but he was unable to help her recover fully.<br>It would take some time for her to fully recover; there wasn&rsquo;t much that Chu Feng could do here to help her.<br>So, Chu Feng followed Lord Yunliang&rsquo;s instructions and started constructing a formation on the energy inside the bottle.<br>Even though Lord Yunliang said that the evil spirits here were unskilled in formations, Chu Feng knew that they were just unable to use it themselves. It would be naive to imagine that they were really ignorant of formations.<br>If a world spirit had accompanied a powerful world spiritist in the past, he would, more or less, know bit about formations. It was just that he couldn&rsquo;t construct byhimself.<br>Take Milady Queen for example, a lot of the formations he knew was actually impacted from her. In fact, even the strongest means he had in his possession right now, Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, came from her too.<br>Besides, this place was constructed using a powerful formation.<br>Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t say for sure whether some of the stronger evil spirits here would be able to detect his formation or not. Thus, he had to be exceptionally careful here, and he put a lot of care into constructing the formation.<br>After a few hours, he finally constructed a formation that he was satisfied with, and he successfully fused the formation together with the energy too.<br>In order to avoid any mishaps, Chu Feng created a small world so that Wang Yuxian could head in an recuperate from her injuries. He manifested the small wrold in the form of a pearl so that he could bring it around with him.<br>After all was done, Chu Feng waited patiently for Lord Yunliang to return, but he only came back the following morning.<br>&ldquo;Are you done fusing the formation into the energy?&rdquo; Lord Yunliang got straight to the point.<br>&ldquo;Milord, it&rsquo;s done,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Follow me. Remember, you just need to follow me. Don&rsquo;t speak a word at all.&rdquo;<br>Even though Lord Yunliang didn&rsquo;t see Wang Yuxian anymore, he didn&rsquo;t bother enquiring deeper into it either. Instead, after issuing some instructions, he grabbed the bottle and left the area. Chu Feng quickly followed him too.<br>Soon, they arrived at a spectacular building. This building was massive, towering at a height of tens of thousands of meters, reaching up to the sky.<br>This building was black in color, and it was designed like a domineering sword that pierced into the clouds too.<br>Just its door was already ten thousand meters tall, and there was a plaque hanging on top that wrote &lsquo;Asura King Palace&rsquo;.<br>Typically speaking, such a large and exquisite building should have given off a feeling of divinity, but this Asura King Palace only felt pressurizing. It was still fine looking at it from afar, but up close, it only made one realize just how small one was.<br>This wasn&rsquo;t just the difference in size but the difference in power too.<br>Chu Feng had fought many monstrous beasts before, and he had even slaughtered those that were ten thousand meters large too. Yet, he couldn&rsquo;t avoid feeling small before this Asura King Palace. It was just a mere building, yet it felt like a behemoth which he couldn&rsquo;t overcome.<br>The pressure induced deference in the depths of his heart.<br>At the doorway of the Asura King Palace stood nearly ten thousand Asura Evil Spirits.<br>Each of these Asura Evil Spirits emanated the aura of a Martial Exalted level cultivator. Even though Chu Feng was unable to discern their exact cultivation, he could tell that they were far stronger than Eggy.<br>At the very least, they were stronger than those evil spirits guarding the prison cell.<br>It was still understandable if there were only several hundred of them, but there were ten thousand of them now, and they were just guards!<br>This made Chu Feng realize once more just how frightening of a place the Asura Graveyard was.<br>Due to Lord Yunliang, they were able to enter the Asura King Palace easily without any impediments despite the place being heavily guarded.<br>Crrrrrkkk!<br>With a loud creaking sound, the ten thousand meters tall door slowly opened, granting Chu Feng a sight into its midst.<br>The Asura King Palace was massive on the outside, but it was even more so on the inside. It really looked boundless.<br>Continuing their journey ahead, Chu Feng and Lord Yunliang crossed numerous gantries, and each of these gantries was guarded with evil spirits. Despite how quickly they were moving, it still took them 15 minutes in order to get to the end of the Asura King Palace.<br>The first thing Chu Feng noticed were three large plaques floating in midair. Each of them spanned over ten thousand meters in length. A human&rsquo;s body really appeared insignificant before these plaques.<br>The leftmost plaque was placed vertically and had the word &lsquo;Hellfire&rsquo; written on it. The word had a domineering vibe to it, as if it had a life on its own. Just looking at the word was more than enough to instill fear into one&rsquo;s heart, making one dare not to show any disrespect.<br>Of course, given how large the plaque was, just a single &lsquo;Hellfire&rsquo; word couldn&rsquo;t possibly fill it up. There was a blank space at the top area of the plaque, and at the bottom, there was a sea of flames.<br>These flames were incredibly sinister. They were black in color, and they released grievous howls reminiscent of millions of wild beasts roaring in unison, bringing terror into one&rsquo;s heart.<br>Despite being a far distance away, Chu Feng could still feel its unbearable heat.<br>If he were to fall into the sea of flames, he would definitely be burned into ashes right away.<br>As for the rightmost plaque, it was also positioned vertically had two large words written on it, &lsquo;King&rsquo;s Stand&rsquo;.<br>Similarly, the top part was empty, and the bottom part was was a delicate stand that emanated glimmering golden light, as if it was made entirely out of gold.<br>However, if one thing was certain, that was definitely not gold. It was made out of a special metallic material that was far nobler than gold.<br>There were runes inscribed on top of the golden stand, but unlike normal runes, they were beautiful like an artwork. Not only so, they were also incredibly intricate, such that even Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t see through them.<br>Compared to the terrifying sea of flames, this massive stand felt like something that had come out of heaven, forming a stark contrast to one another between the two plaques.<br>The middle one, unlike the other two, was positioned horizontally, and it was completely blank. There wasn&rsquo;t even a single word on it.<br></p></div>
