        <h1>Chapter 1724</h1>
        <div> - Heavenly Immortal Sword<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>&ldquo;How is it? Do you still plan to continue to humour me?&rdquo; At this moment when everyone was stunned, Chu Feng chuckled lightly.<br>His light chuckle was like a sudden clap of thunder that exploded in the hearts of the crowd and woke up all of the people that were stunned.<br>&ldquo;A heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation. That Feng Xing actually possesses a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation!!!&rdquo; Suddenly, someone cried out in alarm and revealed an expression of incomparable shock. The gaze with which he looked to Chu Feng simply did not appear to be the gaze of someone looking at a human.<br>&ldquo;Heavens! He&rsquo;s actually that powerful?!&rdquo;<br>Following that, the crowd all began to gasp in shock. They all discovered that Chu Feng was able to win against Ximen Feixue not because he had used any sort of special technique. Rather, it was because he possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation.<br>Other than the Elf Kingdom&rsquo;s princess, there did not seem to be anyone in the entire Holy Land of Martialism who also possessed a battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation.<br>Yet, such another individual had actually appeared. This Feng Xing could be said to be the first person, the only person, from the human race that possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation.<br>As such, how could the crowd not be shocked? How could they not become astonished? How could they possibly remain calm?<br>&ldquo;A genius from the heavens!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;An exceptional demon-level character!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that that child is going to become the Overlord of the human race?&rdquo;<br>At this moment, many people began to exclaim in admiration repeatedly. Whether they were old or young, they were all subdued by Chu Feng&rsquo;s battle power.<br>&ldquo;So what if you possess a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation?&rdquo;<br>The sudden reversal of the situation was something that Ximen Feixue would naturally not find acceptable. He shouted loudly, and then a golden-bright and dazzling &lsquo;Imperial&rsquo; character appeared on his forehead.<br>When the Imperial Character appeared, a golden dragon actually appeared alongside it. Like a phantom, it lingered faintly behind Ximen Feixue.<br>&ldquo;What a powerful Imperial Bloodline,&rdquo; Although others might be confused by this scene, the people from the Dongfang, Beitang and Nangong Imperial Clan were all incomparably shocked.<br>Being also people of Imperial Clans, people that possessed Imperial Bloodlines, they were able to clearly sense how powerful Ximen Feixue&rsquo;s Imperial Bloodline was.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Sure enough, a loud explosion suddenly sounded from Ximen Feixue&rsquo;s body. Immediately afterward, his aura began to rise dramatically. From rank five Half Martial Emperor, he became a rank six Half Martial Emperor.<br>His cultivation had increased by an entire level.<br>&ldquo;Feng Xing, watch my attack!&rdquo;<br>After his cultivation increased, Ximen Feixue began to attack again. Fist and palm strikes began to bombard Chu Feng. His attacks were very similar to Chu Feng&rsquo;s attacks earlier. However, the might behind his attacks was completely different.<br>His palm strikes were like dragon claws that could rip apart heaven and earth. His fist strikes were like meteorites capable of shattering rivers and mountains.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>At this moment, the crowd was startled once again. Chu Feng had just revealed his heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation. Originally, he would have been able to defeat Ximen Feixue.<br>However, Ximen Feixue had increased his cultivation by a single level.<br>The two men...<br>One was a rank five Half Martial Emperor with a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation.<br>The other was a rank six Half Martial Emperor with a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation<br>Logically, the two of them should be equally matched. However, everything that had happened earlier indicated that Ximen Feixue was extremely strong. Would Chu Feng really be able to withstand him?<br>&ldquo;Papapa~~~&rdquo;<br>At the moment when the crowd was worried, Chu Feng did not dodge, nor did he avoid Ximen Feixue&rsquo;s incoming attacks. Instead, he unleashed his own attacks.<br>His legs were like dragon tails as they swept toward the horizon and lashed at the space around him.<br>Ximen Feixue had attacked him with fist and palm strikes, whereas Chu Feng had responded with his legs. The power and might of his leg attacks were not at all inferior to Ximen Feixue&rsquo;s fist and palm attacks. In fact, they were even superior to them.<br>&ldquo;Clank, clank, clank~~~&rdquo;<br>The two men&rsquo;s bodies were clearly made of blood and flesh. Yet, when their bodies collided with one another, they emitted sounds like the collision of steel. With how sturdy their bodies were, to describe them as having bones of steel would likely be inadequate.<br>Admiration. At this moment, the crowd was exclaiming in admiration. The strength of the two men had surpassed that of ordinary members of their generation. They had reached a level where even the elders had to exclaim in admiration.<br>&ldquo;Boom, boom, boom, boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the sound of steel collisions became loud explosions. As the explosions were heard, many energy ripples were created.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s attacks had become more and more ferocious. Before these attacks, Ximen Feixue could only retreat repeatedly and reveal an ugly expression.<br>At this moment, the shocked expressions in the eyes of the crowd grew a bit stronger. There were many people who were so shocked that their mouths were wide open.<br>From a state of being equally matched, Chu Feng had obtained the upper hand and begun to suppress Ximen Feixue.<br>&ldquo;Stop reserving your strength. Go ahead and take out your sword. Otherwise, you will not be a match for me,&rdquo; While suppressing Ximen Feixue, Chu Feng coldly said those words.<br>&ldquo;You are not qualified for me to take out my sword,&rdquo; Ximen Feixue snorted coldly. Then, killing intent surged in his eyes. His palms and legs began to change together. He was planning to unleash a martial skill.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, Chu Feng had a grim smile on his face. Suddenly, he explosively shot forth a palm. As a ray of light flashed past, Chu Feng&rsquo;s palm landed on Ximen Feixue&rsquo;s chest with lightning speed.<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>After being struck by Chu Feng&rsquo;s palm, Ximen Feixue was knocked flying. When he landed on the ground, he started to roll back repeatedly, and nearly rolled off the stage.<br>When he got back up, his complexion turned deathly pale. He grabbed tightly onto his chest and started to frown deeply while gnashing his teeth.<br>He was enduring, enduring the injury that he had just sustained. However, in the end, he was still unable to stop the surging blood from rushing out of his body. Thus, with the opening of his mouth, a mouthful of blood was sprayed out.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>At this moment, the expressions of the crowd changed once again. They began to ponder. After two successive encounters, Feng Xing had come out on the upper hand in both encounters. Could it be that this young man called Feng Xing was really stronger than Ximen Feixue?<br>&ldquo;Feng Xing, you are truly pushing it too far.&rdquo;<br>Ximen Feixue wiped away the bloodstain on the corner of his mouth. At this moment, anger completely covered his face.<br>To someone like him, a person who believed himself to be an exceptional genius, what was most important was his ego.<br>At this moment, his most important ego was being trampled upon. To Ximen Feixue, this was something that he could not tolerate.<br>&ldquo;Clink~~~&rdquo;<br>Finally, a silvery light flashed by Ximen Feixue&rsquo;s hand. Then, a nine-foot long-and half-inch-wide sword appeared in his hand.<br>The sword was completely silver in color. There was no engraving on the sword. At a glance, it appeared to be very ordinary. However, it was not an ordinary sword at all.<br>Once that sword appeared, not only did Ximen Feixue&rsquo;s aura began to explosively increase, even the martial power of the surrounding heaven and earth started to surge violently. In fact, even space itself started to become distorted.<br>All of this originated from that sword.<br>Incomplete Imperial Armament. It was a magnificent Incomplete Imperial Armament. With merely a single glance, one could tell that this was an Incomplete Imperial Armament with an even higher quality than Chu Feng&rsquo;s Cyan Rainbow Sword and Purple Rainbow Sword.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve nearly forgotten. Ximen Feixue is most proficient with swords.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would seem that he&rsquo;s planning to get serious.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Heavenly Immortal Sword, I&rsquo;ve heard of its famous name for a long time now. Today, I will finally be able to experience its might.&rdquo;<br>The crowd began to discuss the matter spiritedly. They were all very pleasantly surprised. They had all heard rumors of how exceptional Ximen Feixue&rsquo;s Heavenly Immortal Sword was. Thus, they were all very happy to be able to experience it today.<br>&ldquo;The Heavenly Immortal Sword, its reputation is well-deserved!!!&rdquo; At the moment when everyone was happy to be able to see the Heavenly Immortal Sword, a shout suddenly sounded from within the crowd.<br>Once that voice was heard, everyone turned their gaze toward the source of the voice. At this moment, at a corner of the crowd that no one had focused on, a old man wearing a conical bamboo hat and ordinary clothes stepped forward.<br>That old man had concealed his cultivation. Thus, it was impossible for the crowd to see through his cultivation. He appeared to be someone very ordinary when hidden in the crowd.<br>However, when the crowd cast their gazes onto him, the more they looked at him, the more their hearts began to waver. They began to feel that this old man was definitely not someone ordinary. Likely, he should be a hidden expert. At the very least, he was a Martial Emperor. Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to hide his strength this well.<br>At this moment, Chu Feng turned his gaze toward the source of the voice too. Upon seeing the old man, Chu Feng started to smirk in his heart. While this man was praising Ximen Feixue, Chu Feng knew that this man was his backer.<br>As for this man, he was none other than the founder of the Southern Cyanwood Forest, Baili Xuankong.<br></p></div>
