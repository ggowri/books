        <div> - The Li Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Formation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That Lightning Mark on his forehead, it&rsquo;s actually the character &lsquo;Divine?&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;His cultivation is rank five Heavenly Immortal?! Could it be&hellip; his actual cultivation is rank four Heavenly Immortal?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No, what&rsquo;s important is not his cultivation. Instead, it&rsquo;s the &lsquo;Divine&rsquo; character on his forehead. He is a possessor of a Heavenly Bloodline. Yet, why would he have a Lightning Mark with the character &lsquo;Divine?&rsquo; Could it be&hellip; that he has trained in the legendary Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations were looking at Chu Feng with more and more concentrated fear in their eyes.<br>The Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique was something that existed only in legends.<br>Yet, they were actually witnessing someone who had trained in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique. With this, how could they not be startled, how could they not fear?<br>&ldquo;To have trained in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique, you must not be someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan. Exactly who are you?&rdquo; Li Youbin asked.<br>He seemed to have determined that Chu Feng was not someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan the moment he was defeated by Chu Feng. The reason for that was because he did not believe that a Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generation would be able to beat him back.<br>&ldquo;Who told you I&rsquo;m not a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled lightly and asked instead of answering.<br>&ldquo;Are you saying that you are a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo; Li Youbin asked.<br>Li Youbin had a very astonished expression on his face. It was not only him; the other Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations also had such an expression.<br>According to what they&rsquo;d heard, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations should be extremely weak, so weak that there wasn&rsquo;t even a Heavenly Immortal-level expert among them.<br>Thus, how could a rank four Heavenly Immortal fellow who had also trained in the legendary Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique appear all of a sudden?<br>Could it be that the rumors that they&rsquo;d heard were false?<br>Suddenly, Li Youbin asked, &ldquo;Are you Chu Qing?&rdquo;<br>Based on what he knew, the strongest member of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generation should be a man by the name of Chu Qing.<br>Although he had never met Chu Qing, and didn&rsquo;t even know what Chu Qing looked like, according to what he knew, it shouldn&rsquo;t be possible for that Chu Qing to be a rank four Heavenly Immortal.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother with it. I don&rsquo;t wish to tell you all who I am. Thus, I will not say my name.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Go ahead and return. Take advantage of the fact that I don&rsquo;t wish to kill you all right now and leave immediately.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng waved his hand at the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s eight younger generations. Then, he turned around and began to walk toward the main formation.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s attitude was no longer one of not placing the eight people of the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generation in his eyes anymore. Instead, he was acting as if he already held their lives in his hand, and could determine their fate at any time.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo; Seeing Chu Feng acting like that, the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations felt extremely displeased.<br>As geniuses among the Ten Great Heavenly Clans&rsquo; younger generations, they had never been treated in such a way by others, much less someone from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm that they looked down on.<br>But, even though they were feeling extremely displeased, even though their hearts were raging with anger, they still didn&rsquo;t say anything.<br>They knew very well that their opponent was stronger than them.<br>Furthermore, even though that fellow clearly knew who they were, he still dared to attack them so recklessly and ruthlessly. They could not afford to provoke a guy like him.<br>If they were to truly provoke him, he might really end up killing them.<br>Because of that, the eight people of the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generation did not say anything, turned around and began to fly toward the direction they had come from.<br>At that moment, the Li Heavenly Clansmen were all gathered outside beneath the Upper Realm Gate. Furthermore, more and more people were gathering there.<br>In fact, another old man had arrived..<br>Not only did he have a head of white hair, but he was also wearing a white gown.<br>His long hair, beard and even his white gown were all whiter than snow, and untainted by even a speck of dust.<br>Furthermore, the old man&rsquo;s aura was extremely extraordinary. It was as if he had descended from the heavens. Even though he seemed very amiable, he still caused all the other people here to treat him with endless reverence.<br>After that white-haired old man appeared, even that old man and that old lady, the two Supreme Elders of the Li Heavenly Clan, revealed respectful expressions on their faces, and voluntarily stood behind him.<br>Even among Supreme Elders, there were disparities in strength and status.<br>The white-haired old man had a nickname, Berserker Li.<br>Not only was he renowned throughout the Li Heavenly Clan, but he was also a top-rated character in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>It could be said that, apart from the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s current Clan Chief, he was the strongest person in the Li Heavenly Clan.<br>The status he possessed in the Li Heavenly Clan was akin to the status that Chu Hanpeng held in the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Furthermore, whilst the white-haired old man appeared to be very amiable, he was famed for his violent temper.<br>Thus, not only were the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s clansmen afraid of him, but even the two Supreme Elders present were afraid of him.<br>However, there was a single person present that was an exception to the case. That person was Li Ruochu.<br>At that moment, even the two Supreme Elders were standing behind Berserker Li. Yet, Li Ruochu was standing beside Berserker Li.<br>From this, one could tell how much this Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s second strongest individual valued Li Ruochu.<br>&ldquo;Ruochu, that girl Yue&rsquo;er has adapted to our Li Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Formation. Her training is going very smoothly. You can rest assured,&rdquo; Berserker Li said to Li Ruochu.<br>The Yue&rsquo;er that he spoke of was naturally Li Ruochu&rsquo;s younger sister, Li Yue&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Thank you senior,&rdquo; hearing those words, Li Ruochu revealed a joyous look, and respectfully expressed her thanks to Berserker Li.<br>Li Ruochu had entered the Li Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Formation to train before. She knew very well how powerful that formation was.<br>It was a formation left behind by their Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Old Ancestor, and the strongest training formation in their Li Heavenly Clan. It was also the training formation that all the people of the younger generation yearned to enter.<br>However, due to the fact that the Li Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Formation had to store up power, it would only open once every thirty years. Furthermore, only a single person was allowed to enter it and train every time it opened.<br>That person had to be the most outstanding person of their Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generation.<br>However, her younger sister Li Yue&rsquo;er was currently not the most outstanding person in their Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generation.<br>Yet, she was allowed to enter their Li Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Formation to train. The reason why her younger sister was allowed to enter the Li Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Formation was all thanks to that Berserker Li. As such, how could Li Ruochu not thank him?<br>Li Yue&rsquo;er had entered the Li Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Formation to train quite a while ago. Thus, Li Ruochu was naturally not feeling joyous because her younger sister had entered the Li Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Formation to train. Rather, it was because Berserker Li had told her that Li Yue&rsquo;er had adapted to the conditions inside.<br>As Li Ruochu had been in the Li Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Formation before, she knew very well that it possessed enormous power. Ordinary people would simply be incapable of withstanding the power. However, should one be able to adapt to the power of the formation, one&rsquo;s cultivation would be able to advance by leaps and bounds.<br>Back then, it was only because she managed to withstand the power of the Li Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Formation that she obtained a true transformation.<br>The lesser the time one needed to adapt to the power of the Li Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Formation, the more one would be able to acquire from the Li Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Formation. As for Li Yue&rsquo;er, she had adapted to the Li Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Formation much faster than she, Li Ruochu, did.<br>This meant that what Li Yue&rsquo;er would obtain would be even greater than what she had obtained back then.<br>As such, how could Li Ruochu not feel joyous?<br></p></div>
