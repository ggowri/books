        <h1>Chapter 5244</h1>
        <div>: Humiliation<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Song Luoyi&rsquo;s grandson?&rdquo;<br>Situ Tingye&rsquo;s voice was quivering when he said those words.<br>Disbelief could be seen reflected in the eyes of the onlookers. They were also aware of the tragedy that had befallen the Golden Dragon Flame Sect back then.<br>They thought that the Golden Dragon Flame Sect had already disappeared from the face of the world, but the man before them was claiming to be Song Luoyi&rsquo;s grandson. They had never heard of Song Luoyi having a lover, let alone a grandson.<br>However, if that man was truly Song Luoyi&rsquo;s grandson, that would explain everything.<br>Song Luoyi was a prodigy amongst prodigies, shining brighter than anyone else in the True Dragon Starfield. There were even some who thought that Song Luoyi could have become a powerhouse in the world of cultivation if not for the Situ World Spiritist Clan&rsquo;s ploy against her back then.<br>It did make sense for her grandson to be exceedingly talented too.<br>Now that they were taking a closer look at Chu Feng, there was indeed a striking resemblance between the two of them. They had only failed to realize it before because such a thought had never crossed their minds.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re indeed a remnant of the wretched Golden Dragon Flame Sect. I should have never spared you back at the Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm,&rdquo; Situ Hongbo spat through gritted teeth.<br>Regret could be heard in his voice.<br>His rationale for not putting Chu Feng on their clan&rsquo;s wanted list was to avoid making an enemy out of Chu Feng, but there was no room for reconciliation if Chu Feng was a descendant of the Golden Dragon Flame Sect. They would have to eliminate Chu Feng at all costs.<br>&ldquo;I should be the one saying those words. You weren&rsquo;t the one in control that day,&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered.<br>Situ Hongbo was rendered speechless.<br>Chu Feng did have the power to dictate the life and death of the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen that day, back when they were still in the Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm, because he had Taowu backing him up.<br>&ldquo;However, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. You&rsquo;re all going to die anyway. It&rsquo;s just a matter of who dies first. Your Situ World Spiritist Clan has done so much evil that you&rsquo;re no different from an evil cult. Those who are gathered here should have an inkling about the vile deeds you have committed. None of you deserve to be granted mercy, but I&rsquo;ll generously grant you one final chance.<br>&ldquo;Those who weren&rsquo;t involved in the attack against the Golden Dragon Flame Sect, back out of the Situ World Spiritist Clan now and I&rsquo;ll spare your lives. If you insist on associating with those miscreants, I&rsquo;ll take your lives too. I won&rsquo;t stop until the Situ World Spiritist Clan vanishes from the face of the world,&rdquo; Chu Feng declared.<br>His words were spoken with a leisurely tone, but everyone knew that he wasn&rsquo;t horsing around.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll make our Situ World Spiritist Clan vanish from the face of the world? Hah, do you think that you have the ability to do so? You aren&rsquo;t even going to be able to get out of here alive today!&rdquo; Situ Tingye roared.<br>&ldquo;You think that I lack the ability to do so? Situ Tingye, shouldn&rsquo;t you know better than anyone else that you were fortunate to survive that day?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; You have helpers?&rdquo;<br>Situ Tingye was suddenly reminded of the tragedy he had seen in the ancient city the other day, and it filled his heart with fright.<br>Even if Chu Feng was the mastermind behind that incident, he couldn&rsquo;t possibly have killed so many experts of the Situ World Spiritist Clan by himself. He definitely had helpers with him. It might even be possible that his helpers are here today, which would justify his fearless attitude.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng smiled wordlessly at that conjecture. He exuded a confident vibe as if he was in absolute control over the situation.<br>That affirmed the guesses of the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen that Chu Feng did have helpers with him. It left them wondering if they were going to die here today as well.<br>Situ Tingye&rsquo;s face turned pale whereas the others flew into a fluster.<br>What Chu Feng did next further fanned their unease.<br>He first devoured the juniors&rsquo; origin energies and robbed them of their treasures before moving on to decapitate all of them.<br>&ldquo;I was so angered by that old thing trying to befriend me that I ended allowing you all to die such easy deaths. It&rsquo;s fine though. I can always torture others instead,&rdquo; Chu Feng murmured under his breath.<br>Those words were conveyed to those outside via the formation. His sinister laughter after saying those words made him look no different from a demon.<br>The Situ World Spiritist Clansmen felt shivers down their spines.<br>&ldquo;Torture others? What does he mean by that?&rdquo;<br>The Situ World Spiritist Clansmen looked at each other, fearing that Chu Feng was going to make a move on them.<br>Once Chu Feng had taken everything he wanted, he stood up and looked at the sky. He knew that his words and actions were being broadcasted to the onlookers outside.<br>&ldquo;Useless fools of the Situ World Spiritist Clan, do you want to exact vengeance for your juniors? I&rsquo;ll give you an opportunity. I&rsquo;ll leave the formation right now. Come and kill me if you have the guts to do so.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng began making his way toward the entrance of the spirit beast mountain range.<br>Not a single one of the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen made a move to engage Chu Feng, including Situ Tingye and Situ Hongbo. Intimidated by Chu Feng&rsquo;s words, they earnestly believed that he could only be this confident because he had helpers behind him.<br>And they didn&rsquo;t think that they would be able to deal with Chu Feng&rsquo;s helpers.<br>Situ Tingye had personally witnessed the brutal deaths of their elite force in the ancient city, whereas Situ Hongbo had personally met Taowu. They didn&rsquo;t think that Chu Feng was bluffing here.<br>&ldquo;Lord Tingye.&rdquo;<br>Situ Hongbo turned to Situ Tingye to seek his opinion on how they should proceed with this matter, but the latter didn&rsquo;t answer. How could Situ Tingye couldn&rsquo;t possibly tell Situ Hongbo that he was afraid too?<br>While the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen struggled to decide what they should do, Chu Feng had already arrived at the entrance of the spirit beast mountain range.<br>As soon as he stepped out of the formation, he suddenly vanished altogether. It was not just his body that had disappeared but his aura too. He had simultaneously activated his concealment formation and Divine Concealment.<br>He couldn&rsquo;t have activated them beforehand as there was a possibility that the formation around the spirit beast mountain valley was able to detect him. After all, the formation was constructed by the founder of the Situ World Spiritist Clan, a world spiritist far more powerful than him.<br>If the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen found out about his concealment abilities in advance and were able to track him, they would be able to devise a countermeasure to track him down.<br>However, now that he was already outside the formation, he was confident that no one would be able to track him anymore. No one had been at the entrance to stop him, and there was no oppressive might exerted in the vicinity to suppress him either.<br>Clearly, the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen were intimidated by his words.<br>Under concealment, he made use of this opening to quickly rush to the teleportation formation that he had constructed in advance and fled the area. This set of movement was completed within a split second.<br>&ldquo;A bunch of fools!&rdquo;<br>To be frank, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t think that his escape would have been so smooth. He thought that the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen would at least try to stop him, but they weren&rsquo;t doing anything at all. Once again, this showed that they were a bunch of cowards.<br>Just the thought that the Golden Dragon Flame Sect was destroyed by this bunch of cowards made his blood boil. He was more determined than ever to exact his vengeance.<br>&hellip;<br>Meanwhile, the onlookers still had their eyes fixated on the entrance of the spirit beast mountain range.<br>&ldquo;It has gone completely silent. Has he really left the area?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No one from the Situ World Spiritist Clan tried to stop him even after he had killed all of their juniors. They actually allowed him to escape right under their eyelids! Why?&rdquo;<br>The crowd didn&rsquo;t dare to voice their questions aloud, but their minds were filled with doubts.<br>&ldquo;Men, seal off the entrance. Capture that man alive! I&rsquo;ll personally end his life!&rdquo; Situ Tingye suddenly spoke up.<br>The Situ World Spiritist Clansmen immediately got to action. They wouldn&rsquo;t dare to disobey an order coming from a grand elder.<br>&ldquo;The hell! Even fools can tell that he has already left the area! Are they putting on an act for us?&rdquo;<br>Even though the onlookers dared not to say anything, their eyes were filled with disdain for the Situ World Spiritist Clan. It was obvious that they didn&rsquo;t dare to stop Chu Feng, and they were only just putting on a show now to salvage whatever was left of their dignity.<br>It went without saying that they couldn&rsquo;t find Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;How interesting. This junior hunting competition was more exciting than I could have imagined. I should return to the Holy Valley and ask around when did such a formidable figure appear in our Holy Light Galaxy,&rdquo; Shengguang Daokui thought with ravenous joy.<br>He wasn&rsquo;t planning to return to the Holy Valley that quickly, but his meeting with Chu Feng changed his mind. He wanted to get to the bottom of Chu Feng&rsquo;s background.<br>The incident today had shocked many people, leaving them burning with curiosity about Chu Feng.<br>Oblivious to everyone, someone had been watching the scene from the start to the end from the sky. No one had sensed her gaze, but she was able to see through everything, including the silhouette of the concealed Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng was already a far distance away from the spirit beast mountain valley, but even so, she was still able to see him clearly.<br>She was none other than the mysterious woman whom Chu Feng had encountered in the Ancient Era&rsquo;s forbidden land.<br>She had a gentle appearance that seemed completely devoid of aggression, but she carried a lofty disposition that placed her on a pedestal against others. This disposition stemmed from her self-confidence, which was built on her strength. There was hardly anything in the world that could spark her fear.<br>Yet, there was a hint of shock in her eyes.<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s vicious despite his young age, but how does he intend to single-handedly deal with the Situ World Spiritist Clan? I&rsquo;m really starting to get curious.&rdquo;<br>The lips of the mysterious woman curled up. She turned around and left the area, though the direction she headed in was the same as Chu Feng&rsquo;s.<br>&hellip;<br>Not to anyone&rsquo;s surprise, the Situ World Spiritist Clan failed to find Chu Feng after combing the area. The upper echelons of the Situ World Spiritist Clan gathered on a floating warship to discuss the matter.<br>&ldquo;Lord Tingye, we appear to have been duped. It&rsquo;s unlikely that Chu Feng brought any powerful helpers with him, or else he wouldn&rsquo;t have left just like that,&rdquo; Situ Hongbo said.<br>Considering the irreconcilable grudge between them and the Golden Dragon Flame Sect, there was no reason for Chu Feng to spare them here if he was able to take them down. By this logic, Chu Feng&rsquo;s escape suggested that he didn&rsquo;t have any powerful helpers with him.<br>In other words&hellip; he was just putting on a bravado.<br>&ldquo;We got duped? That despicable bastard!&rdquo;<br>Situ Tingye clenched his fists tightly.<br>Not only did their Situ World Spiritist Clan suffer heavy casualties, but they had also been humiliated here. This was a complete loss for them!<br></div>
