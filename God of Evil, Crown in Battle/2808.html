        <div> - Who&rsquo;s The Coward<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Chu Feng did not immediately answer Han Yu&rsquo;s provocation.<br>Chu Feng did not know Han Yu well. Thus, he had no idea how powerful Han Yu was.<br>Merely, he had a sensation that Han Yu would not be as easy to handle as Yuwen Hualong. Otherwise, Han Yu wouldn&rsquo;t have challenged Chu Feng so confidently.<br>&ldquo;Yoh, this place is truly bustling with noise and excitement. Everyone is actually all gathered here.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a clear and spirited voice was heard.<br>The crowd turned their gazes toward the voice, and discovered that a beautiful young woman was standing before a pillar of light.<br>That person was none other than the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s young miss, Chu Lingxi.<br>It was not only Chu Lingxi, Xia Yun&rsquo;er was also there. Those two beauties actually came out from the mountain together.<br>&ldquo;Lady Holy Daughter, we&rsquo;ve heard that you entered Buried Spirit Lake. In that case, did you manage to make a breakthrough in your world spirit techniques?&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing Xia Yun&rsquo;er, the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s disciples hurriedly rushed over.<br>Among them were the disciples that she had abandoned earlier.<br>However, they did not mention the fact that Xia Yun&rsquo;er had abandoned them. It was as if nothing had happened at all.<br>Not only that, but they were also all feeling joy for Xia Yun&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Thank you senior brothers, senior sisters and elders. I have gained an abundant harvest this time around. Together with Lady Chu Lingxi and Young Master Chu Feng, we&rsquo;ve all successfully broken through to the Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist level.&rdquo;<br>Xia Yun&rsquo;er smiled sweetly and spoke with an incomparably amiable tone.<br>&ldquo;All three of them became Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists?!&rdquo;<br>Once Xia Yun&rsquo;er said those words, the crowd present were unable to contain themselves from sucking in a mouthful of cold air.<br>They never expected that three Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists would emerge at once.<br>This was simply something extremely shocking. After all, even when disregarding their talent, their ages were already extremely shocking.<br>The three of them should be the three youngest Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>At the same time when the crowd was astonished, Chu Feng was also astonished.<br>The reason Chu Feng was astonished was because Xia Yun&rsquo;er had been so determined to kill him earlier. Yet now, when faced with the crowd, her attitude towards Chu Feng had returned to how it was before. It was as if nothing had happened at all. That girl&rsquo;s ability to disguise herself was truly extraordinary.<br>As for Han Yu, his expression grew even uglier after hearing that Chu Feng and the others became Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists.<br>Being a Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist was originally a way to show off his talent.<br>After all, extremely few people as young as him were able to become Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists.<br>However, now that Chu Feng was also a Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, it would mean that he would be crushed by Chu Feng. After all, Chu Feng was much younger than him.<br>As such, the hatred he held for Chu Feng involuntarily increased by quite a bit.<br>He pointed at Chu Feng and loudly shouted, &ldquo;Chu Feng, I am asking you if you dare to fight against me, Han Yu!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Han Yu, how shameless are you? Your cultivation is two entire levels above Chu Feng&rsquo;s. Yet you dare to challenge him to a battle? Why don&rsquo;t you ask him if he&rsquo;s willing to be killed by you instead?&rdquo;<br>Before Chu Feng could say anything, Li Xiang spoke. After his cultivation was crippled by Yuwen Tingyi, he became much more daring. This was especially true when facing Han Yu and the others; he would be completely blunt and impolite.<br>&ldquo;Isn't this Chu Feng a genius? He not only trains in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique, but he has also grasped those heaven-defying secret skills.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even my two brothers&rsquo; cultivations have been crippled by him. His actions are truly arrogant.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet, what is this? When it&rsquo;s my turn to challenge him, he no longer dares to accept my challenge?&rdquo;<br>Han Yu did not bother with Li Xiang. Instead, he looked to Chu Feng with a mocking and taunting expression in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;It is true that Chu Feng has grasped the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique. However, wasn&rsquo;t your Divine Body also capable of increasing your cultivation by a single level?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There is currently a large disparity in strength between the two of you. How could Chu Feng possibly be a match for you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if you want to challenge Chu Feng, you should wait for Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength to be on par with yours, no?&rdquo; Li Xiang said.<br>Chu Feng knew very well that Li Xiang was saying all this to warn him about Han Yu&rsquo;s extraordinary prowess. He was hinting to Chu Feng not to fight against Han Yu.<br>&ldquo;What I, Han Yu, am capable of is merely the manifestation of my own ability. As for my cultivation, it is something that I obtained through training myself.&rdquo;<br>Han Yu snorted arrogantly. Then, he looked to Chu Feng again, &ldquo;Chu Feng, I am asking you. Do you dare to accept my challenge or not?!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the Sacred Pellet Villa&rsquo;s Elder Ma Changchun said, &ldquo;Little friend Han Yu, this old man wants to spar with you too. Do you dare to accept my challenge?&rdquo;<br>Han Yu&rsquo;s expression changed slightly after hearing those words. He naturally did not dare to spar with Ma Changchun. After all, the disparity in strength between them was too enormous.<br>However, he was not willing to give up with just this. He acted as if he hadn&rsquo;t heard Ma Changchun at all, and continued to ask Chu Feng, &ldquo;I am asking you if you dare to accept my challenge. Coward. Do you not even have the courage to answer me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a coward?&rdquo; Chu Feng laughed. Then, he said, &ldquo;If I, Chu Feng, am a coward, I wouldn&rsquo;t have crippled Yuwen Tingyi and Yuwen Hualong&rsquo;s cultivations.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Merely, you are a rank six True Immortal and ranked tenth on the Demon-level Geniuses List. Yet, you continue to ask a rank four True Immortal if he is daring enough to accept your challenge. Do you think that I am a fool, or are you stupid?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In that case, it would mean that you don&rsquo;t dare to accept my challenge?&rdquo; Han Yu asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t dare to accept your challenge. I don&rsquo;t need you to have the same level of cultivation as myself, as long as you&rsquo;re a single level of cultivation above me, I, Chu Feng, would dare to fight against you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How about this, you can voluntarily suppress your cultivation by a single level and spar with me with the cultivation of a rank five True Immortal. Do you dare to do that?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Why must I suppress my own cultivation? My cultivation is something that I have painstakingly obtained through training, why must I suppress it?&rdquo; Han Yu asked.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng smiled. He then said, &ldquo;In that case, it would mean that you don&rsquo;t dare to do it?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng sighed. He added, &ldquo;Actually, I already knew that you wouldn&rsquo;t dare to suppress your own cultivation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I knew that you were also not confident. That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re also scared, scared that you&rsquo;ll be defeated by me should we have equal strength.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Judging from things now, I was correct. Ranked tenth genius on the Demon-level Geniuses List, but it turns out you&rsquo;re nothing more than a coward either.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You damned coward, just because you do not dare to spar against me, you instead decide to call me a coward?&rdquo; At that moment, Han Yu&rsquo;s voice grew even more resounding. It would appear that he was angered by Chu Feng&rsquo;s mocking.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve said it already. As long as you are to suppress your cultivation to rank five True Immortal, I would dare to fight against you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet, you do not even dare to suppress your cultivation. Let me ask, between the two of us, who is the actual coward?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a sneer.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo; At that moment, Han Yu grew even more furious. As he spoke, he began to walk toward Chu Feng. He seemed to be planning to forcibly attack Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Han Yu, don&rsquo;t you make trouble without reason. If you are to continue to act like this, your impression in our hearts will become worse and worse,&rdquo; an elder from the Immortal Armament Villa said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. While it is true that your cultivation is something that you&rsquo;ve obtained through training yourself, how much older are you compared to little friend Chu Feng? Don&rsquo;t you know that very well yourself? Where did you obtain your confidence to insult another in a place like this?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, all of the elders from the Immortal Armament Villa and the Sacred Pellet Villa started to criticize Han Yu.<br>As for the bystanders, although they did not openly criticize Han Yu, they were all thinking the same thing in their hearts.<br>At that moment, everyone felt that Han Yu was deliberately causing trouble without reason.<br>Faced with the crowd&rsquo;s criticisms, Han Yu&rsquo;s expression grew increasingly more ugly. However, he was still persisting.<br>He actually knew from the very beginning that a provocation like this would most likely be refused by Chu Feng, and even looked down on by the crowd.<br>However, he was unable to think of any other method. He was truly furious at what Chu Feng had done. He was unable to endure having Yuwen Hualong and Yuwen Tingyi&rsquo;s cultivations crippled just like that, crippled by Chu Feng.<br>If he was to give up on things just like that, he would be angered to death.<br>The reason for that was because he was truly unable to swallow his resentment, his rage.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, if Han Yu&rsquo;s cultivation is only a single level above yours, would you dare to accept his challenge?&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a deep and resounding voice was suddenly heard. At the same time, a figure appeared in the sky.<br>Upon seeing that person, the people from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan hurriedly got on their knees and bowed respectfully.<br>Even the elders present began to clasp their fists and bow to that person.<br>The reason for that was because that person was the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;If his cultivation is only a single level above my own, this junior is willing to fight against him,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Very well. I will help you with this,&rdquo; the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br><br><br></p></div>
