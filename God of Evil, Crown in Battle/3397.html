        <div> - The Arrival Of A Peak Grand Character<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;I truly never expected a girl like you have such an attentive side,&rdquo; Chu Feng looked to Wuma Shengjie with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;I feel that senior Chu Xuanyuan would definitely not be like you, completely improper and unprofessional,&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie rolled her eyes at Chu Feng. Then, she turned around and prepared to leave.<br>&ldquo;Girl, where are you going?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I am naturally going to fight over another entrance,&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie said.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go and fight with them. Go ahead and enter through this rat zodiac&rsquo;s entrance,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Are you looking down on me? Is that why you wanted to go out and fight them instead of me?&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie felt displeased.<br>She admitted that Chu Feng was stronger than her. However, she was quite confident that she would be able to successfully obtain an entrance against those people, and did not need Chu Feng&rsquo;s help.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to fight them either,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going either?&rdquo; Hearing those words, Wuma Shengjie was startled, and became confused.<br>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; As Chu Feng spoke, he waved his sleeve, and the grand unsealing formation behind him appeared.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? Could it be that there&rsquo;s another entrance here that could lead to the grand formation?&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie was able to tell with a single glance that the formation that Chu Feng was unsealing was an entrance to another passage.<br>&ldquo;Mn, this is a hidden path. It also leads to the grand formation. I will enter through it,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, do you need me to assist you in opening this entrance?&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie asked.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need. Go ahead and go in first. You must take note of these things after you enter the grand formation,&rdquo; As Chu Feng spoke, he gently pointed with his finger, and a body of light flew out, shooting straight toward Wuma Shengjie&rsquo;s head.<br>Wuma Shengjie did not evade the incoming body of light, and allowed it to enter her head.<br>After the body of light entered her head, she learned all of the things that Chu Feng wanted to tell her.<br>The contents were not only able to allow Wuma Shengjie to rapidly evade all of the checkpoints within the rat zodiac&rsquo;s entrance, clearing them with the fastest speed, but they also taught her what to do after entering the grand formation so that she could gain the most benefits, and even potentially discover a world spiritist sword left behind by the World Spiritist Immortal King.<br>&ldquo;How do you know all this?&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie&rsquo;s beautiful eyes moved around. Shock filled her eyes. The information that Chu Feng had passed on to her was simply too important. It could even be said to be a priceless treasure.<br>&ldquo;They were left behind by a senior in the Fire Prison. I just so happened to discover them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;According to my own observations, they should all be real. To us, they just so happen to be very useful,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re telling me that after you were imprisoned in the Fire Prison, you just so happened to discover the secrets regarding the grand formation left behind by a senior?&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie became even more astonished.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty much the case,&rdquo; Chu Feng scratched his head awkwardly.<br>&ldquo;What sort of luck do you have?&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie was so astonished that she opened her beautiful eyes wide.<br>&ldquo;I suppose this is fate,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled.<br>&ldquo;Since your fate is so good, I will compete against you. I&rsquo;m going in,&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie entered the entrance of the rat zodiac after saying those words.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>After Wuma Shengjie entered the rat zodiac&rsquo;s entrance, the rat zodiac&rsquo;s mouth that was originally open suddenly closed.<br>This meant that someone had managed to successfully enter the passage leading to the grand formation.<br>&ldquo;It has begun. Merely&hellip; Chu Feng and that Wuma Shengjie, exactly who entered?&rdquo;<br>Even though the rat zodiac&rsquo;s entrance was not the first to close, it still caught the attention of quite a few people.<br>Even Wuming Xingyun and Queen Mother Fox Immortal revealed curious looks.<br>They all knew that Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie were both inside the rat zodiac&rsquo;s entrance.<br>At present, neither of them had exited the rat zodiac&rsquo;s entrance. Yet, one had entered the passage.<br>The crowd could not help but ponder if it was Chu Feng or Wuma Shengjie who had entered the passage.<br>&ldquo;There shouldn&rsquo;t be anything unexpected, right?&rdquo; Queen Mother Fox Immortal said as she looked to Wuming Xingyun. By &lsquo;shouldn&rsquo;t be anything unexpected&rsquo;, she meant that Chu Feng should&rsquo;ve successfully defeated Wuma Shengjie and entered the entrance.<br>After all, she was able to see through both Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie&rsquo;s cultivation.<br>In terms of cultivation, Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation was a level above Wuma Shengjie&rsquo;s. Thus, there shouldn&rsquo;t be much suspense in a confrontation between the two of them.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not necessarily the case. After all, before Chu Feng appeared, everyone felt that Wuma Shengjie was the prophesied child. Seeing that child today, I could tell that she is indeed extraordinary, and could be said to be a demon-level genius,&rdquo; Wuming Xingyun said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, you think that the result is undetermined?&rdquo; Queen Mother Fox Immortal asked.<br>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it more interesting when the result is undetermined?&rdquo; Wuming Xingyun smiled.<br>&ldquo;Seems like I came late.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a figure suddenly appeared and landed beside Wuming Xingyun and Queen Mother Fox Immortal.<br>It was an old man. He had a head of long hair that extended all the way to his feet like a waterfall. However, his long hair did not touch the ground, and was instead floating before it landed on the ground.<br>Furthermore, his head of golden hair was very dazzling. His hair seemed to be made of gold, and was glistening under the sunlight. It was extremely eye-catching.<br>That old man had a very aged appearance. However, his eyes were very bright, and full of expression. At the very least, those eyes simply did not resemble the eyes of an old man.<br>It is said that one&rsquo;s eyes are the window to the soul.<br>Judging from the eyes of the old man, he possessed superb health.<br>As for the old man, he was none other than Grandmaster Long Xuan.<br>&ldquo;Why did you come here?&rdquo; Queen Mother Fox Immortal revealed a surprised look upon seeing Grandmaster Long Xuan.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son came. That&rsquo;s why I came here to check things out,&rdquo; Grandmaster Long Xuan said.<br>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re here, what about the main formation?&rdquo; Queen Mother Fox Immortal asked.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, the setup for the main formation is already done,&rdquo; Grandmaster Long Xuan said.<br>&ldquo;Who are you trying to deceive? How could the main formation be completed so quickly?&rdquo; Queen Mother Fox Immortal had an expression of disbelief. At the same time, she was slightly angered, for she felt that Grandmaster Long Xuan was lying to her.<br>The reason why Grandmaster Long Xuan and Liangqiu Chengfeng had not shown up the entire time was because the two of them were setting up the main formation.<br>The reason why Queen Mother Fox Immortal and Wuming Xingyun had not done anything was because only two people could set up the main formation.<br>However, according to their speculations, it was impossible to finish setting up the main formation so quickly. At the very least, they needed twenty more hours to finish the task.<br>&ldquo;It is indeed completed,&rdquo; Right at that moment, another figure appeared. That person&hellip; was Liangqiu Chengfeng.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo; Seeing Liangqiu Chengfeng, Queen Mother Fox Immortal felt confused.<br>Compared to Grandmaster Long Xuan, Liangqiu Chengfeng was a very reliable person. It was impossible for him to lie. Thus, if he said it was completed, the setup must definitely have been completed.<br>However, the timing of things was clearly incorrect. According to their strength, they shouldn&rsquo;t have been able to set up the main formation so quickly. Most importantly, they had completed it twenty hours before the estimated time.<br>&ldquo;Did you notify them that Chu Feng came?&rdquo; Suddenly, Queen Mother Fox Immortal looked at Wuming Xingyun.<br>&ldquo;I thought it was you who had notified them,&rdquo; Wuming Xingyun smiled.<br>&ldquo;Since it was neither you nor I, who told the two of you that Chu Feng came?&rdquo;<br>Queen Mother Fox Immortal had an astonished look on her face as she looked towards Liangqiu Chengfeng and Grandmaster Long Xuan.<br>Wuming Xingyun also cast a curious look at Liangqiu Chengfeng and Grandmaster Long Xuan.<br>The two of them wanted to know the answer.<br>&ldquo;It was this old man.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, the space before the four of them started to distort. Then, a figure walked out from that distorted space and stood before the four.<br>Seeing that person, both Queen Mother Fox Immortal and Wuming Xingyun revealed astonished looks on their faces.<br>It was not only them...<br>If Chu Feng was present, he would definitely feel astonished too. The reason for that was because the person who had appeared, was someone that he had met before.<br>That person was none other than the old man Chu Feng had encountered in the fire prison. It was that old man who had told Chu Feng about the contents of the Fire Prison&rsquo;s rock mountain.<br>Merely, Chu Feng did not know that that person actually possessed an identity that brought fear to even the four grand individuals present.<br>The reason for that was because that old man was an actual peak grand character.<br></p></div>
