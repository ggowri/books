        <h1>Chapter 5210</h1>
        <div>: The Vile Fairy Spirit World<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Weng!<br>The two halos began morphing into two separate but identical formations.<br>Chu Feng and Tao Wu could tell that they weren&rsquo;t able to enter the same formation, meaning that these two formations were likely intended to be a trial or perhaps even a competition between them.<br>After all, only one of them could obtain the Godsoul.<br>At the same time, the two of them noticed just how dangerous the formation was. The slightest error could easily cost them their lives.<br>&ldquo;Ssss!&rdquo;<br>Tao Wu took a sharp gasp of air. He turned to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Young brother Chu Feng, I&rsquo;m not worried about your competing for the Godsoul with him, but that formation is simply too dangerous. You should think twice before entering it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Elder, I&rsquo;m grateful for your reminder, but we have already come this far. I&rsquo;d like to give it a try. What about you?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Risks and opportunities come hand in hand. I&rsquo;m not one to cower before an opportunity,&rdquo; Tao Wu said. &ldquo;Young brother Chu Feng, you should give it your all. I&rsquo;m much stronger than you think I am.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Elder, you should also give it your all too. We aren&rsquo;t just fighting for ourselves here, after all,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo;<br>Tao Wu laughed heartily.<br>It was truly a mysterious relationship between the two of them. Despite being competitors, neither of them saw the other as an enemy. At the same time, they had no intention of going easy on the other party either.<br>They wished the best for the other party, but at the same time, they had no intention on losing here. This was what true friendship and respect were like.<br>Chu Feng and Tao Wu entered their formation at the same time.<br>Same as before, the formations demanded nothing from their spirit power, and there was no need for them to construct a formation at all. All they tested were their world spiritist techniques. Thus, Chu Feng and Tao Wu didn&rsquo;t have to dispel the spirit power imbued into them.<br>The two of them vanished into their respective formations, so they were unaware of the situation that happened in the two halls afterward.<br>Meanwhile, Xue Ji was walking down the completely empty adjacent hall.<br>What was a glass panel from Chu Feng and Tao Wu&rsquo;s point of view was nothing more than a wall from her perspective, which was why she didn&rsquo;t notice those two in the neighboring hall.<br>&ldquo;What is this place?&rdquo; Xue Ji murmured with an annoyed frown.<br>It hadn&rsquo;t been easy for her to reach this place, and she thought that she would be able to acquire the ultimate treasure here. Yet, there was nothing at all in this massive hall. It looked as if she had made this trip in futility.<br>Weng!<br>The spirit formation gate behind her whirred.<br>Xue Ji warily turned around and saw 39 other world spirits entering the hall one by one. These world spirits were all from the Seven Spiritual World, with the exception of the Asura Spirit World.<br>&ldquo;Lass from the Asura Spirit World, why don&rsquo;t you join me?&rdquo;<br>The leader of those world spirits was a woman from the Fairy Spirit World. She was beautiful and commanded a transcendental disposition, reminiscent of a heavenly fairy descending to the mortal world. It was just that her attitude was extremely arrogant and lofty.<br>She didn&rsquo;t even bother taking a proper look at Xue Ji as she made that offer.<br>However, she was extremely powerful. Just the aura she emanated made the hall rumble ever so slightly. Her cultivation was at rank eight Half-God level.<br>Her strength was the reason behind her arrogance.<br>It was likely that the other world spirits had chosen to follow her because of her strength too.<br>&ldquo;Join you? Are you worthy of that?&rdquo;<br>Yet, Xue Ji didn&rsquo;t hesitate to show her disdain for the woman from the Fairy Spirit World despite being in a weaker position here. Her cold attitude drew hostility from the other party.<br>&ldquo;You wench! We were being generous to you, but how dare a Martial Exalted level Asura World Spirit weakling speak so arrogantly to us?&rdquo; a brawny man from the Demon Spirit World stepped forward and berated Xue Ji.<br>The brawny man was also extremely powerful, being a rank seven Half-God level cultivator.<br>&ldquo;Do you know who we are? I am the chief world spirit of Daoist Ninth Dragon, and she is the chief world spirit of Daoist Eighth Dragon! Who do you think you are? How dare a small fry from the Asura Spirit World turn down our offer?&rdquo;<br>The brawny man from the Demon Spirit World hurled insults at Xue Ji.<br>However, Xue Ji wasn&rsquo;t angered by his insults. On the contrary, she burst into laughter. Her reaction stunned all of the other world spirits present.<br>&ldquo;Why is she laughing?&rdquo;<br>The world spirits were confused by Xue Ji&rsquo;s reaction. They noticed that she wasn&rsquo;t laughing out of fear.<br>Shoosh!<br>Xue Ji abruptly vanished.<br>Wuah!<br>The next instant, the brawny man from the Demon Spirit World cried in agony. The crowd immediately turned their sights over, only to pale at what they saw.<br>The brawny man was lying on the ground, his head crushed under Xue Ji&rsquo;s foot.<br>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the small fry now?&rdquo; Xue Ji asked.<br>&ldquo;I-I-I am the small fry!&rdquo; the brawny man replied in a panic.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more like it,&rdquo; Xue Ji replied with a smile.<br>She pushed her leg down and a popping sound ensued. The brawny man&rsquo;s brain was crushed into bits just like that, causing him to fall dead.<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo;<br>All of the world spirits, including the rank eight Half-God level woman from the Fairy Spirit World, was astounded. Xue Ji&rsquo;s body was glowing with a golden light, and she was emanating power comparable to a rank nine Half-God level cultivator.<br>This was weird considering how her cultivation had only been at Martial Exalted level earlier.<br>&ldquo;How did you get so strong?&rsquo; the woman from the Fairy Spirit World asked.<br>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t get anything from the earlier passageway? Ah, you must have been too dumb to understand what&rsquo;s going on,&rdquo; Xue Ji said with a mocking smile.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no wonder you&rsquo;re so arrogant. It looks like you do have the ability to back up your attitude too. I guess my greatest competitor here is none other than you.&rdquo;<br>An eerie smile formed on the woman&rsquo;s lips.<br>Shoosh!<br>With a wave of her sleeves, the woman sent a silver whip shooting straight toward Xue Ji. Her attack was comparable to that of a rank nine Half-God level cultivator, a rank higher than her actual cultivation. She had the power to surmount a single rank of cultivation.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; Xue Ji sneered.<br>She adeptly controlled the golden aura as if it was her martial power, keeping the woman&rsquo;s silver whip firmly at bay.<br>Similar to the power Chu Feng had obtained, Xue Ji&rsquo;s golden aura raised her fighting prowess but restricted what she could do. She was unable to use her usual means and weapons, meaning that she could only fight using the golden aura.<br>Even so, Xue Ji was a highly adept fighter. Despite her critical disadvantage of being unable to use her usual means, she was still able to claim the upper hand over her opponent.<br>Realizing that the fight wasn&rsquo;t in her favor, the woman suddenly flicked a golden orb toward the spectating world spirits. As soon as the golden orb came close to those world spirits, it exerted a terrifying suction force that dragged the world spirits in.<br>Gah!<br>Pained screams ensued.<br>Blood and flesh splattered everywhere as the bodies of the world spirits were torn apart under the powerful suction force and devoured by the golden orb. Even the brawny man from the Demon Spirit World whom Xue Ji had killed earlier wasn&rsquo;t spared from this tragedy.<br>It took a mere moment for all of the spectating world spirits to be devoured by the golden orb and converted into the woman&rsquo;s strength.<br>&ldquo;So, this is the Fairy Spirit World? Hah!&rdquo; Xue Ji sneered in disdain.<br>The Fairy Spirit World had always prided themselves on being an righteous power, but the golden orb was far worse than the means of the demonic sects.<br>&ldquo;What are you laughing at? They are meant to be my stepping stone! Their masters are also the stepping stones of my master!&rdquo; the woman from the Fairy Spirit World said proudly<br>Xue Ji wasn&rsquo;t interested on wasting her breath with her, so she continued her attacks.<br>&ldquo;Holy Aurora!&rdquo;<br>With a roar, the woman twirled her whip and scattered golden light all around. The golden light then morphed into countless swords that rained down on the hall.<br>This was such a powerful skill that Xue Ji was forced to take evasive measures. Despite that, she still received many wounds from the attack.<br>By the end of the attack, Xue Ji was already forced to the corner of the hall. She realized that she wasn&rsquo;t a match for the woman from the Fairy Spirit World anymore. If she wanted to survive, she would have to find another way to deal with her enemy.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? Where did you run so far away? What happened to your earlier arrogance?&rdquo; the woman asked gleefully.<br>&ldquo;How ironic. A coward who murders others for their power is mocking others? The Fairy Spirit World is more shameless than I have thought!&rdquo; a voice suddenly echoed from another corner of the hall.<br>The woman from the Fairy Spirit World hurriedly turned her head over in astonishment. Xue Ji also narrowed her eyes.<br>Someone was standing at the corner of the hall, and it looked like she had been there for quite some time now. It was a young girl with stunning visuals and a domineering disposition.<br>Milady Queen.<br></p></div>
