        <h1>Chapter 5127</h1>
        <div>: Aura of Death<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Shoosh!<br>There was suddenly a gush of blood. The Night Monarch&rsquo;s hand that had been grabbing the Asura King&rsquo;s black sword was suddenly severed into two.<br>&ldquo;This feeling?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart skipped a beat. He could sense that the Asura King&rsquo;s cultivation was still at rank four Half-God level, but his fighting prowess had increased to a level comparable to rank five Half-God level cultivators.<br>The Asura King was able to rival enemies onecultivation rank higher than him, making him a formidable force.<br>&ldquo;You're able to exert battle prowess a rank higher than your current cultivation level? It looks like I&rsquo;ve underestimated you.&rdquo;<br>Even though the Night Monarch was still bleeding profusely from his severed palm, he still remained perfectly composed as if he couldn&rsquo;t feel the pain at all. His lips even curled into an excited smile.<br>Shoosh!<br>Shoosh!<br>Shoosh!<br>Innumerable black blades suddenly flashed through the sky in the direction of the Night Monarch. It was from the Asura King. He launched a barrage of relentless lethal attacks in hopes of taking the Night Monarch&rsquo;s life.<br>He was showing the Night Monarch that he wasn&rsquo;t a pushover.<br>&ldquo;Interesting.&rdquo;<br>The Night Monarch&rsquo;s smile grew even eviler.<br>He dodged those blades before thrusting his palm forward. Unknowingly, his severed palm had completely healed up, not hindering the might of his attack at all.<br>The Asura King sensed the immense force behind the Night Monarch&rsquo;s attack, so he quickly blocked it with the black sword. Despite that, he was still sent flying into the distance.<br>&ldquo;Set up the formation!&rdquo;<br>The Asura King quickly regained his balance before roaring an order. Then, he began charging at the Night Monarch once more with his black sword.<br>At the same time, black gaseous flames started pouring out from the Asura World Spirit Army, surging toward the Asura King. They fused together with the Asura King, coming under his control.<br>The fight between the Asura King and the Night Monarch happened at such a fast pace that Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t see their movements at all. He could only feel the intense pressure created when they crossed blows.<br>He could feel that the Asura King had gotten significantly stronger after receiving the black gaseous flames from the Asura World Spirit Army, but even so, the Asura King still appeared to be in a disadvantageous position.<br>The formation set up by the Asura World Spirit Army was indubitably powerful, but they had to pay a heavy price on it. Their faces showed the immense strain they were put under for sustaining the formation.<br>&ldquo;This won&rsquo;t do. We&rsquo;ll lose at this rate,&rdquo; Chu Feng murmured to himself.<br>The Asura King and the Asura World Spirit Army had already put in their full force, but they were struggling just to match the Night Monarch, let alone defeat him. On top of that, the Night Monarch was in a weakened state at the moment, which meant that he would only grow stronger with time.<br>By then, they would be goners.<br>Thus, Chu Feng turned his sights toward the coffin-like formation. He could tell that there was something special about the formation as it shared the same aura as the Night Monarch. Most likely, it had supported the Night Monarch while he was in hibernation.<br>He was hoping to find a crack in the Night Monarch&rsquo;s defenses through the formation.<br>Surprisingly, he really did find one.<br>&ldquo;Elder, please stall the Night Monarch for me. Keep his attention on you,&rdquo; Chu Feng told the Asura King via voice transmission.<br>The Asura King turned to the Asura World Spirit Army and bellowed, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with all of you? No strength?&rdquo;<br>The Asura World Spirit Army roared impassionedly in response. They released even more black gaseous flames than before, but this came at a heavy price. They started to bleed from their apertures, and their skin cracked. They were putting their lives on the line here.<br>However, their sacrifice wasn&rsquo;t in vain. The Asura King received another huge boost in strength, further intensifying his fight with the Night Monarch. He was able to tie down the Night Monarch with this.<br>Chu Feng made use of this opportunity to sneak to the coffin formation, where he found the formation core linked to the Night Monarch&rsquo;s life. He quickly placed a formation he had prepared beforehand into the formation core and activated it.<br>Pu!<br>The Night Monarch suddenly spewed a mouthful of blood.<br>Just as Chu Feng had deduced, the formation core was indeed linked to the Night Monarch&rsquo;s life. Otherwise, the latter wouldn&rsquo;t have suffered injuries right away when the formation core received damage.<br>&ldquo;You brat!&rdquo;<br>The Night Monarch was able to figure out what had happened right away, and he directed a vicious glare at Chu Feng.<br>Seeing that he had been discovered, Chu Feng quickly focused his full attention on activating his formation, hoping to completely destroy the formation core linked to the Night Monarch&rsquo;s life.<br>The Asura King also tried his best to tie the Night Monarch down so as to buy time for Chu Feng.<br>However, with just a wave of his sleeves, the Night Monarch was able to freeze the Asura King in mid-air despite the intense fight they had earlier.<br>&ldquo;You vicious brat. I was just playing around with you all, but you tried to take my life?&rdquo; the Night Monarch spat coldly.<br>&ldquo;Master!&rdquo;<br>Realizing that harm was going to befall Chu Feng, the Asura World Spirit Army immediately halted their formation and rushed over to Chu Feng&rsquo;s side. They knew that they weren&rsquo;t a match for the Night Monarch, and rushing over right now would only spell death. Yet, there was no hesitation in their movement.<br>They were willing to lay down their lives just to protect Chu Feng even for just a second more.<br>Hmph!<br>With a cold harrumph, the Night Monarch froze the Asura World Spirit Army in mid-air. At the same time, the formation Chu Feng had tossed into the formation core unraveled, and Chu Feng found himself frozen on the spot too.<br>The space within the hall trembled violently, but in a different way from before. It was induced not by an external force but out of sheer fear.<br>The Night Monarch was simply too powerful.<br>Chu Feng and the others realized that the Night Monarch hadn&rsquo;t even gotten serious in their earlier clash. Histrue strength was so great that neither the Asura King nor the Asura World Spirit Army was a match for it.<br>The Night Monarch glared at Chu Feng with ferocious eyes as heslowly approached him a step at a time.<br>&ldquo;You despicable brat. I&rsquo;ll tear you to shreds!&rdquo;<br>In the blink of an eye, the Night Monarch arrived in front of Chu Feng. His hands began to close in on Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare!&rdquo;<br>The Asura King and the Asura World Spirit Army hollered in shock, but their words were of no use. They lamented how useless they were in this situation. They could only watch helplessly as the Night Monarch&rsquo;s hands approached the weak Chu Feng.<br>Pu!<br>The Night Monarch&rsquo;s nails pierced into Chu Feng&rsquo;s body like a dagger, and he pushed his hand deeper and deeper. His movement was surprisingly slow, as if he wanted to prolong his suffering.<br>This attack wasn&rsquo;t just a physical one. It was also striking at Chu Feng&rsquo;s soul too.<br>Even so, Chu Feng clenched his teeth and held on, refusing to let out any sound.<br>&ldquo;You can take this without making a noise? Looks like you have some backbone despite your young age. Well, you can die with that spunk of yours.&rdquo;<br>Killing intent flashed across the Night Monarch&rsquo;s eyes. He was really planning to kill Chu Feng this time around.<br>Chu Feng could feel the aura of death shrouding around him. It was so close that it almost felt tangible. All it took was the Night Monarch to exert some strength in hispalm, and his life would be extinguished in a snuff.<br>Pu!<br>All of a sudden, a spurt of searing fresh blood spewed all over Chu Feng&rsquo;s face. It had come from the Night Monarch.<br>Someone had severed the Night Monarch&rsquo;s arms.<br>The Night Monarch backed away in a fluster as he stared at hissevered arms in disbelief. The Asura King and the Asura World Spirit Army were taken aback too.<br>It had happened so quickly that no one was able to make sense of it.<br>It was then that a voice echoed from the entrance of the hall.<br>&ldquo;My apologies, Night Monarch. It was not my intention to make a move so quickly, but I didn&rsquo;t have a choice. It&rsquo;d be troublesome if he died here.&rdquo;<br></p></div>
