        <h1>Chapter 1797</h1>
        <div> - A Bamboo Slip<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>After that voice filled with anger was heard, two figures descend from the sky. They were two men. One was a middle-aged man, and the other was a young man.<br>They were Zhang Tianyi and that mysterious man, Zhang Tianyi&rsquo;s biological father.<br>Seeing them together, Chu Feng discovered that Zhang Tianyi really did resemble that mysterious man. Standing next to one another, they sure looked like father and son.<br>Merely, Zhang Tianyi had a very worried expression on his face, and was hinting at Chu Feng with his eyes the entire time. As for that mysterious man, although he had a calm expression, anger filled his face.<br>Without even thinking about it, Chu Feng was able to guess that Leng Yue&rsquo;s three golden bowls were not as powerful as she had thought. Although they were able to conceal them from the others, they were evidently unable to conceal them from Zhang Tianyi&rsquo;s father.<br>That was the reason why Zhang Tianyi&rsquo;s father was this angry.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, Leng Yue, the two of you have refused to abide by the rules. Are you prepared to accept your punishment?&rdquo; Zhang Tianyi&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s sword-like eyebrows were narrowed as he said those words while staring at Chu Feng and Leng Yue.<br>&ldquo;Punishment? What punishment? Even if we have broken the rules, at the very most, you can disqualify us. Where did punishment come from?&rdquo; Leng Yue asked.<br>&ldquo;If the two of you had only competed with one another, you would naturally not be punished. However, you have killed someone in my territory, killed the Weaponry Refinement Immortal&rsquo;s disciple. How am I to explain this matter to the Weaponry Refinement Immortal? Naturally, you must be punished,&rdquo; Zhang Tianyi&rsquo;s father said.<br>&ldquo;......&rdquo; At this moment, Leng Yue grew speechless. She also knew that it had been wrong for her to kill Baili Xinghe.<br>Zhang Tianyi stepped forward and said, &ldquo;Father, while Leng Yue has killed someone, Chu Feng did not kill anyone. He doesn&rsquo;t have to receive punishment, right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Tianyi, it is precisely because that Chu Feng is your friend that he must be punished. In order to not have others think that I am shielding Chu Feng, he too must be punished,&rdquo; Zhang Tianyi&rsquo;s father said.<br>&ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo; Zhang Tianyi wanted to say more.<br>&ldquo;Senior Zhang, Chu Feng is willing to accept your punishment,&rdquo; Before Zhang Tianyi could finish what he wanted to say, Chu Feng interrupted him. He did not wish to make things difficult for Zhang Tianyi.<br>&ldquo;Very well. The two of you, prepare yourselves,&rdquo; Zhang Tianyi&rsquo;s father took a bottle gourd from his sleeve.<br>That bottle gourd was extremely shabby-looking. In fact, there were even fine cracks on it. However, when the bottle gourd appeared, both Chu Feng and Leng Yue&rsquo;s eyes started to shine.<br>Special veined patterns filled the surface of the bottle gourd. Those were characters that neither Chu Feng nor Leng Yue could understand. Apart from that, the bottle gourd was also emitting an ancient aura. That bottle gourd was something from the Ancient Era.<br>&ldquo;What are you planning to do? Exactly how are you planning to punish us?&rdquo; Leng Yue started to panic. She had managed to detect that the bottle gourd was dangerous.<br>&ldquo;Stay in here for two hours. After two hours, I&rsquo;ll release you two,&rdquo; Zhang Tianyi&rsquo;s father first opened the bottle gourd. He then extended his arm and made a grabbing motion. Then, a powerful suction power sucked both Chu Feng and Leng Yue into the bottle gourd.<br>&ldquo;Wuuahh~~~&rdquo;<br>Instantly, Chu Feng felt that his surroundings were shaking. Not only were his surroundings pitch-black, the space in the gourd was also being distorted nonstop. Most importantly, in this place, Chu Feng was unable to move in the slightest.<br>&ldquo;Wuu~~~&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng started to tightly clench down on his teeth. The reason for that was because an unbearable pain was starting to engulf his entire body.<br>Especially his head, it was hurting extremely badly. It was as if countless sledgehammers were smashing upon his head with a speed of three thousand blows every second. His head was in so much pain that Chu Feng started to tightly clench his fists. It was so unbearable that even his soul started to tremble.<br>Two hours? Could he really endure this for two hours?<br>Chu Feng began to worry in his heart. He thought to himself that Zhang Tianyi&rsquo;s father was truly impartial, truly ruthless.<br>What was contained in this place was an ancient era&rsquo;s formation. Even Chu Feng would not be able to break through the formation. Not to mention him, even Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists would not be able to break through the formation.<br>If one were to enter this place, one could only endure the torments from the formation. Chu Feng knew that this formation was meant to be used to torment others.<br>Although two hours might not be a long time, it was very possible for one to have a nervous breakdown after spending two hours in this sort of place. If one were to have a nervous breakdown, one would end up dying in here.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>At the moment when Chu Feng was enduring the pain, he was shocked to discover that his senses had become clear. He had discovered an object in this originally pitch-black space.<br>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; Although Chu Feng was still unable to clearly see that object, Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart was moved. He had determined that it was most definitely not something ordinary.<br>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;...<br>&ldquo;Father, what you&rsquo;re doing is too excessive. No matter what, Chu Feng is my brother. Furthermore, both you and I know very well that Chu Feng did this for my sake.&rdquo; Outside, Zhang Tianyi had an expression of unwillingness as he looked to his father.<br>Zhang Tianyi had always held his father in high regard, and had never dared to be rude to him. However, this time around, he was unable to contain himself. The reason for that was because he did not wish for his brother to suffer after helping him.<br>&ldquo;Tianyi, you also saw what happened earlier. That Leng Yue and Chu Feng&rsquo;s techniques, what do you think about them?&rdquo; Zhang Tianyi&rsquo;s father asked.<br>&ldquo;They are both above me. I am inferior to them,&rdquo; Zhang Tianyi looked to his father, &ldquo;Why did you ask this? Could it be that you want to do something to Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking down on your father too much,&rdquo; Zhang Tianyi&rsquo;s father smiled. Then, he said, &ldquo;Tomorrow, if you were to encounter Chu Feng, he would definitely let you win. However, if you were to encounter Leng Yue, she would definitely not go easy on you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You can tell that Chu Feng did what he did to help you, thus, how can I not tell that too? You are grateful to Chu Feng, how could I not be grateful to Chu Feng too?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Tianyi, you need to know that, in this world, there is no one who cares about you more than me. I naturally wish for you to become even stronger,&rdquo; After saying those words, Zhang Tianyi&rsquo;s father placed his hands onto Zhang Tianyi&rsquo;s shoulders. With a very passionate gaze, he looked to Zhang Tianyi and said, &ldquo;Thus, I am not harming Chu Feng. Instead, I am helping him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But father, I have been to that place before. Even you have been to that place before. You should know how difficult it is for one to endure that place. If one spends too much time in there, one will die. Two hours, how could they possibly endure so long?&rdquo; Zhang Tianyi was extremely worried. He had personally experienced it before. Thus, he knew how frightening that place was.<br>&ldquo;Indeed. Both you and I have failed. However, Chu Feng and Leng Yue&rsquo;s talents are above us, father and son. Especially Chu Feng. I feel that he might be able to obtain the benefit contained within that place,&rdquo; Zhang Tianyi&rsquo;s father said.<br>&ldquo;But father, that bottle gourd is already a legend. No one knows whether or not it actually contains the legendary benefit. At the very least, ever since our Ancestor&rsquo;s time, no one has ever obtained the benefit of that bottle gourd. Even that senior did not,&rdquo; Zhang Tianyi was still worried.<br>&ldquo;No, the legend is real. It is merely us descendants who are incompetent.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, I have plans. I will not let Chu Feng die in there,&rdquo; After saying those words, Zhang Tianyi&rsquo;s father looked to the bottle gourd in his hand and said, &ldquo;I am merely giving him an opportunity, the opportunity to obtain a whole new level of understanding of martial cultivation.&rdquo;<br>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;...<br>At the same time, Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze was growing clearer and clearer. He was able to gradually see what that object was.<br>Bamboo slip. It was a bamboo slip.<br>Although it was a bamboo slip, it was floating in midair. It appeared to be unparalleled, like the ruler of all living things looking down from above.<br></p></div>
