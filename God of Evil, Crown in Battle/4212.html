        <div> - Returning To the Seven Suns Mountain Range<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not important anymore. What sort of favorable encounter Chu Feng might&rsquo;ve had is his business.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Regardless of what his favorable encounter might have been, regardless of what sort of secret he might be hiding, it doesn't change the fact that he saved our lives.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for him, all of us would have died today.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, for the sake of saving us, he offended the All-seeing Heavenly Master.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The grace he showed us is something that we cannot forget,&rdquo; said Long Xiaoxiao.<br>&ldquo;What Your Highness says is very correct.&rdquo;<br>Long Shengbu, Long Nanxun and even Elder Ruiyun all agreed with Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s words.<br>Even though they had a lot of questions about Chu Feng, it remained that both Long Nanxun and Elder Ruiyun had gained a whole new opinion of Chu Feng after what had happened.<br>&hellip;...<br>With the power of the main formation, Chu Feng and Yu Ting soon arrived at the Reincarnation Upper Realm.<br>The spirit formation gate that connected to the Reincarnation Upper Realm was not hidden in a remnant.<br>Instead, it was hidden somewhere deep underground.<br>One thing worthy of mentioning was that the spirit formation gate in the Reincarnation Upper Realm was located right below the Seven Suns Mountain Range.<br>As for the Seven Suns Mountain Range, it was where Yuan Shu was.<br>&ldquo;Sure enough, senior Ox-nose has set up all these spirit formation gates deliberately.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He knew that Grandmaster Tang Chen was here. That&rsquo;s why he used the power of the Dark Black Monstrous God&rsquo;s housing to set up a spirit formation gate here. It&rsquo;s all for his own convenience.&rdquo;<br>After coming from underground, Chu Feng sighed with emotions.<br>More emotions filled his head as he looked at the Seven Suns Mountain Range. After all, there was a series of memories he had made there.<br>But, Chu Feng soon cast his gaze to the area above the Seven Suns Mountain Range.<br>He discovered that there was an enormous war chariot there.<br>That war chariot was so vast that there were dozens of gorgeous palaces atop it.<br>The enormous war chariot was towed by over a hundred giant spirit formation beasts.<br>Each of those giant spirit formation beasts was over a thousand meters tall.<br>That said, the giant war chariot was hidden by a concealment formation.<br>Because of that, others were simply unable to detect it.<br>Even Chu Feng had only been able to sense it earlier.<br>When he saw the giant war chariot, Chu Feng narrowed his brows.<br>The giant war chariot was simply extraordinary, which meant that the master of the giant war chariot must be an exceptional expert.<br>Even though cultivators from all over had set up camp at the foot of the Seven Suns Mountain Range year-round, those cultivators clearly couldn't be compared to the giant war chariot&rsquo;s master.<br>In fact, even Yuan Shu would not be able to compare with an existence of that caliber.<br>Most likely, the giant war chariot had not come for Yuan Shu.<br>Instead, it had come for his master, Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>Chu Feng had no idea if this was a calamity or a blessing.<br>His intuition was telling him that things were not simple.<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t want to implicate Yu Ting. Thus, he said to her, &ldquo;Yu Ting, don&rsquo;t go in just yet. Wait for me here.&rdquo;<br>Yu Ting was no fool. She understood Chu Feng&rsquo;s intentions. She raised her head and took a glance at the war chariot in the sky before nodding at Chu Feng, &ldquo;You be careful then.&rdquo;<br>Yu Ting did not make things difficult for Chu Feng. She had decided to stay and wait for him.<br>After Yu Ting agreed to wait, Chu Feng immediately proceeded toward the Seven Suns Mountain Range.<br>&hellip;...<br>Yuan Shu stood Inside a forbidden area in the Seven Suns Mountain Range..<br>Standing across from him was another person.<br>Even though that person had the face of a young man, he had a head of long snow-white hair.<br>Although his appearance was rather handsome, it was also very treacherous.<br>Especially his eyes. One could tell from a glance that he was a villain of some sort.<br>He was looking at Yuan Shu with a gaze filled with provocation.<br>It turned out that the two of them were competing with world spirit techniques.<br>One person was attacking, and the other was defending.<br>The person attacking was Yuan Shu.<br>The spirit formation that Yuan Shu had set up for his attack had taken the form of eighteen weapons.<br>The eighteen weapons were all glistening with golden light. They each measured a thousand meters, and were attacking his opponent&rsquo;s protective formation from all sides.<br>Yuan Shu&rsquo;s opponent&rsquo;s protective formation was very simple.<br>It was only a semi-transparent spheroid. The spheroid covered the white-haired man&rsquo;s entire body.<br>But, Yuan Shu was actually unable to do anything to that simple-looking protective formation.<br>&ldquo;Yuan Shu, time&rsquo;s up,&rdquo; the white-haired man said suddenly.<br>Hearing those words, Yuan Shu waved his sleeve, and the eighteen enormous weapons floating in midair all turned into light and dispersed into thin air.<br>Compared to the man&rsquo;s calm composure, Yuan Shu was covered in sweat, and even panting.<br>But, when Yuan Shu looked to that man, he had a smile on his face.<br>&ldquo;Brother Li, it is this Yuan Shu&rsquo;s defeat.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although I&rsquo;ve recently comprehended rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation, I am clearly still no match for brother Li,&rdquo; said Yuan Shu.<br>&ldquo;Yuan Shu, you shouldn&rsquo;t admit defeat so quickly.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t we agree to exchange the attack and defense order after a round?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since you were attacking and I was defending in the first round, it&rsquo;s now my turn to attack,&rdquo; said the white-haired man.<br>&ldquo;Brother Li, I&rsquo;ve already acknowledged that I am no match for you. Must we still continue?&rdquo; asked Yuan Shu.<br>&ldquo;Of course. I&rsquo;m actually specialized in protective formations. My offensive formations are not as strong.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, brother Yuan Shu need not be too scared. Perhaps I won&rsquo;t be able to breach brother Yuan Shu&rsquo;s protective formation at all. Our spar today might end in a draw.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, even if you fail to take my attack, I will stop promptly. I won&rsquo;t injure brother Yuan Shu.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s more, the rules are a match each. Thus, we should abide by it,&rdquo; said the white-haired man.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a simple spar. There&rsquo;s no need to insist like this, no?&rdquo; Yuan Shu asked again, still with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Humph.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a cold snort was heard.<br>It turned out that there was a figure standing far from where the two people were sparring.<br>That figure was an old man.<br>The old man was quite different from the white-haired man.<br>The old man&rsquo;s face was covered in wrinkles. From his appearance, one could tell that he was extremely old.<br>Yet, the old man had a head of long, jet-black hair.<br>The old man was very tall. His size was far larger than that of ordinary people. He was ten meters tall. He was like a small giant.<br>Moreover, his build was also robust. Even though he was wearing clothes, the outline of his muscles could still be seen.<br>Most importantly, the old man had a fierce face. His sharp eyebrows were especially vicious.<br>At that moment, the old man was standing far away with his hands crossed in front of his chest and staring at Yuan Shu with a look of contempt.<br>&ldquo;Back then, Tang Chen had told me that the disciple he'd meticulously found possessed talent not inferior to the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted&rsquo;s disciple Lu Jie.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Seeing him today, not only are his world spirit techniques lacking, even his courage is exceptionally small.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;To take someone this weak as his disciple, it would appear that Tang Chen has truly misjudged this time.&rdquo;<br>The black-haired old man&rsquo;s voice was thunderously loud. It was also filled with mockery.<br>When his words reached Yuan Shu&rsquo;s ears, they ignited anger in him.<br>Then, Yuan Shu began setting up a spirit formation.<br>After a short period of time, enough for a cup of tea, an exquisite protective formation had appeared around him.<br>&ldquo;Brother Li, come at me.&rdquo;<br>When Yuan Shu said those words, even his gaze had changed.<br>Compared to before, he had become much more serious.<br></p></div>
