        <h1>Chapter 5337</h1>
        <div>: Blood Against Blood, Lineage Against Lineage<br>Those humongous beings inside the boundless space were the most primitive forms of bloodline powers. No matter how powerful a cultivator was, how could they withstand something like that?<br>&ldquo;Is this considered a part of the Ancestral Ritual?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;You can say so,&rdquo; Little Crescent replied.<br>&ldquo;Will you save her as long as I clear the trial?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll save her as long as you dare to step in.&rdquo;<br>Little Crescent was honestly doubtful that Chu Feng could clear the trial. She was going through with it because this was the only glimmer of hope for their Ancient Realm, but she knew that the chance of success was low.<br>Chu Feng walked up to Little Crescent and carefully touched Eggy&rsquo;s black gaseous flames. His eyes were filled with yearning. He turned to Little Crescent and said, &ldquo;I trust you.&rdquo;<br>Then, he stepped into the gate.<br>Gah!<br>An incomparably chilling scream escaped from his lips the moment he entered the boundless space. All it took was a split moment for him to be dragged deep in by a powerful force.<br>At the same time, the bloodline beasts in the boundless space noticed the presence of prey and began swarming around Chu Feng. They unleashed the unimaginable power they harnessed within them on his little body.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s flesh was torn apart and his soul shattered. Yet, mysteriously enough, his shattered soul didn&rsquo;t dissipate into nothingness. He was barely holding it together with his sheer willpower.<br>&ldquo;That fellow is able to remain conscious even in such a situation? Is it because of that lass?&rdquo; Little Crescent found the situation hard to believe.<br>Anyone who had been put through such pain should have long lost their consciousness, and that would have spelled death in the boundless space. The level of willpower Chu Feng was displaying here was not something she had seen in anyone else.<br>It was no longer just willpower at play here. It was faith.<br>As Little Crescent watched the situation inside the gate, she placed her palm on Eggy&rsquo;s black gaseous flames and infused her energy into them. The black gaseous flames began to reshape themselves to form Eggy&rsquo;s original body.<br>This wasn&rsquo;t Eggy&rsquo;s real body but one made out of black gaseous flames, but it was enough for her to regain consciousness. As soon as she opened her eyes, she heard Chu Feng&rsquo;s scream and turned toward the gate. Her face paled when she saw what was going on inside.<br>&ldquo;What did you do to Chu Feng?!&rdquo; Eggy roared at Little Crescent.<br>Eggy knew that the power she had used against the Bluemoon Sacred Palace should have taken her life. The fact that Little Crescent could drag her back from the pits of hell meant that she was an extremely powerful and possibly dangerous individual.<br>Due to that, she was wary of Little Crescent despite knowing that the latter had saved her life.<br>&ldquo;I told him that I&rsquo;ll save you as long as he&rsquo;s willing to undergo the trial,&rdquo; Little Crescent replied.<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo;<br>Eggy glared at Little Crescent with eyes filled with hatred. She tried to dash into the gate to save Chu Feng, but a force pushed her back before she could even get close.<br>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t enter the gate in your current state. Some words of advice, you should cherish your life a little more. You should have realized by now that Chu Feng is facing this much pain because of your earlier recklessness,&rdquo; Little Crescent said.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need you to save me. Let him out,&rdquo; Eggy replied.<br>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do. I&rsquo;ve waited for a person like him for far too long. The chances might be slim, but at least there&rsquo;s a glimmer of hope. What if he succeeds?&rdquo; Little Crescent replied.<br>&ldquo;Have you forgotten how Chu Feng treated you back then? Why are you using him like that?&rdquo; Eggy questioned her.<br>&ldquo;I admit that he&rsquo;s a kind person, but what about it? Do you expect me to kowtow to him in gratitude just because he showed that bit of goodwill to me? I am not as foolish or noble as you,&rdquo; Little Crescent replied.<br>Eggy was in a panic. Determination filled her eyes as she began to gather her black gaseous flames. However, a powerful force tightly bound her before she could make a move.<br>&ldquo;Are you out of your mind? You&rsquo;re still going to ignite your life force even when you&rsquo;re in your current state?&rdquo; Little Crescent berated her.<br>&ldquo;Let me go! What I do is none of your business!&rdquo; Eggy cried.<br>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do. I promised Chu Feng that I&rsquo;ll save you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need you to save me! Let Chu Feng out!&rdquo;<br>Little Crescent simply ignored Eggy.<br>Left with no choice, Eggy could only turn to Chu Feng and shout, &ldquo;Chu Feng, come out right now! This Queen doesn&rsquo;t need your saving. Are you an idiot?!&rdquo;<br>Eggy screamed with all her might, but Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t hear her at all.<br>How could he when his body and soul were in tatters and he was suffering unimaginable pain? He was barely retaining a sliver of consciousness held together by his willpower and faith.<br>Eggy glared at Little Crescent furiously, but she suppressed her anger. For the first time in her life, she humbly lowered her head and said, &ldquo;I have never kneeled to anyone in my life before, but I&rsquo;m begging you here. Please let Chu Feng off.&rdquo;<br>Eggy fell to her knees. She was willing to lower her pride for Chu Feng&rsquo;s sake.<br>Pah!<br>Before she could kneel down, Little Crescent pulled her up and said, &ldquo;Are you ill in the head or something? It&rsquo;s none of my business whether you have kneeled to anyone else in your life.&rdquo;<br>Little Crescent pointed to Chu Feng and emphasized her point, &ldquo;What I need right now is for him to clear the trial. He willingly entered the gate. I didn&rsquo;t coerce him into it. It&rsquo;s none of my business whether he dies in there or not. Your life and death is also none of my business too. Have some self-awareness and realize that the two of you have landed in this situation on your own accord. You shouldn&rsquo;t blame me for your mistakes. You also shouldn&rsquo;t expect me to suddenly become a saint just because you&rsquo;re willing to get on your knees.&rdquo;<br>Despite Little Crescent&rsquo;s harsh words, her tone didn&rsquo;t sound as certain as before. It was almost as if she was trying to convince herself that what she was doing wasn&rsquo;t wrong.<br>Her determination had started wavering when she saw the state Chu Feng was in. He might be holding his ground, but the bloodline powers inside the boundless space were simply too strong. In the first place, this was an impossible trial.<br>She had tested Chu Feng&rsquo;s courage, willpower, and talent beforehand to verify his qualification, but even so, it was still far from sufficient for him to survive inside the boundless space.<br>Those were tens of thousands of bloodline powers inside the boundless space. They were free to exert their full strength there. No cultivator could possibly withstand that.<br>And Chu Feng was indeed approaching his limit. He could feel his life slowly creeping to its end. He had been through many life-and-death situations, but this was the first time he had felt so close to death&rsquo;s embrace.<br>He had actually heard Eggy&rsquo;s calls, but he didn&rsquo;t have the strength to answer her.<br>&ldquo;Eggy, you have to live on.&rdquo; He could only murmur these words in his heart.<br>He had no way of dealing with the bloodline powers, and he wasn&rsquo;t resilient to hold on till the end either. But just as he was about to lose his grip on his consciousness, a powerful voice echoed in his ears, &ldquo;Brat, do you need help?&rdquo;<br>Upon hearing that voice, Chu Feng suddenly felt a small burst of strength that allowed him to barely pull his consciousness and life force together. He had heard this voice many times before, but this was the first time it was communicating with him. He trembled in excitement.<br>He gathered all his strength and shouted back, &ldquo;Elder, please lend me your strength!&rdquo;<br>The next moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s body began glowing with blinding brilliance.<br>Tzlala!<br>The tens of thousands of bloodline powers surrounding Chu Feng were pushed back. An incomparably massive beast surged out of Chu Feng&rsquo;s body and protected its weak host.<br>Little Crescent&rsquo;s mouth opened agape.<br>It was a humongous red lightning beast wielding strength that none of the tens of thousands of bloodline powers here could rival.<br>&ldquo;This is the second possibility. Clash of bloodlines. Blood against blood, lineage against lineage. But why is there only a single lightning beast? Shouldn&rsquo;t the Heavenly Lightning Bloodline have nine lightning beasts? A single lightning beast wouldn&rsquo;t be enough to rival tens of thousands of bloodline powers.&rdquo; Little Crescent shook her head.<br>She had neglected to mention the second possibility earlier because she didn&rsquo;t think that Chu Feng would be able to release his bloodline. His ability to do so came as a huge surprise, but it wouldn&rsquo;t make much of a difference if he only manifested a single lightning beast. An incomplete Heavenly Lightning Bloodline couldn&rsquo;t rival tens of thousands of complete bloodline powers.<br>And indeed, while the bloodline powers had been pushed back, they continued to encircle Chu Feng and the red lightning beast. Their hisses and roars shook the boundless space as they readied themselves to destroy the red lightning beast with a single, decisive strike.<br>Destructive energy surged in the boundless space.<br>Little Crescent knew that it couldn&rsquo;t seep out of the ancient gate, but she still hurriedly dragged Eggy away with her. She was afraid because these were powers far beyond her reach. Just the slightest wisp was enough to destroy not just her and the Ancient Realm but large swathes of the Totem Galaxy as well.<br>Those bloodline powers were merely fooling around earlier when they tortured Chu Feng. That had been nothing but a sliver of their true strength. However, the appearance of the red lightning beast had forced them to get serious. The boundless space quaked before their strength.<br>Despite being severely outnumbered, the red lightning beast sneered in disdain, &ldquo;What arrogance it is for insignificant things like you to parade your minuscule powers before me?&rdquo;<br>Killing intent flared in the eyes of the red lightning beast.<br>Tzlala!<br>Red lightning bolts flooded out from the lightning beast and ravaged the boundless space. They only lasted for a brief instant before vanishing into thin air, as if it had all been an illusion.<br>Yet, Little Crescent opened her mouth wide in sheer shock.<br>Only two figures were left in the boundless space&mdash;Chu Feng and the incomparably large red lightning beast. All it took was an instant for the red lightning beast to destroy the tens of thousands of bloodline powers.<br>Little Crescent gasped for air. It was a sight so terrifying that she found herself completely frozen in place, unable to move at all.<br>All of a sudden, the red lightning beast turned to look at Little Crescent.<br>Little Crescent&rsquo;s knees caved in, and she fell onto the ground. The immense pressure heaped on her left her unable to breathe.<br>She was aware that bloodline powers weren&rsquo;t equal in strength, but she had never heard of such a powerful bloodline power before, let alone seen one in person. It finally dawned upon her why only a single lightning beast had appeared.<br>Why nine when one sufficed?<br></div>
