        <h1>Chapter 4476</h1>
        <div>: You Must Die<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think that there would be such a formidable genius in the world. It&rsquo;s just like the saying &lsquo;there&rsquo;s always going to be a mountain higher than the other&rsquo;, huh?&rdquo;<br>The crowd stared at Chu Feng in agitation. They couldn&rsquo;t calm the shock that had shaken their bodies.<br>Many of the juniors present directed looks of admiration and awe toward Chu Feng.<br>Putting aside cultivation, just in terms of means and combat skills, none of those present in the field knew anyone who was able to outdo Chu Feng.<br>The fact that Zhao Batian was able to defeat Long Xiaoxiao was more than enough to show that he was a formidable cultivator in his own right, but he had been completely outmatched by Chu Feng.<br>In the eyes of the crowd, Chu Feng was no longer just at the level of prodigy anymore. He was a terrifying monster that towered above prodigies, an existence that far surpassed one&rsquo;s imagination.<br>&ldquo;It looks like you didn&rsquo;t go all out in the fight against me back then, Brother Chu Feng,&rdquo; Yu Lie, who had fought with Chu Feng back at the desert outside the Godwish Palace, remarked wistfully.<br>The prowess that Chu Feng had displayed today was far stronger than the previous time they crossed blows with one another. This went to show that Chu Feng had held back against him.<br>In any case, it was clear that Zhao Batian had already lost here. Despite so, Chu Feng was still looking at Zhao Batian with eyes gleaming in hostility.<br>&ldquo;Little benefactor, let&rsquo;s forget it and leave this place,&rdquo; a voice suddenly sounded beside Chu Feng&mdash;Long Xiaoxiao.<br>She had a good grasp of Chu Feng&rsquo;s character after being with him for some time, and she could tell that Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t intend to let things go at just this.<br>However, she was well aware that the Zhao Clan was backed by the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, and she didn&rsquo;t wish to see Chu Feng crossing the Nine Souls Sacred Clan for her.<br>And in truth, before Long Xiaoxiao even said a thing, there were already many people who were sending voice transmissions to Chu Feng to advise him not to make things difficult for Zhao Batian, and these people included the Supreme Elders from the Cloudsky Immortal Sect, the Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster, and most notably of all, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>However, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t pay any heed to their words at all.<br>As people who had chosen to stand by one side and leave Long Xiaoxiao to the lurch, he felt that they had no right to say anything to him.<br>However, Long Xiaoxiao was different. She was the victim here, so when she said those words, Chu Feng began to waver a little.<br>He pondered for a moment before he turned around and headed to where Long Xiaoxiao was.<br>This was a sign that he had decided to let Zhao Batian go.<br>Swoosh!<br>But before Chu Feng could even walk away, a burst of killing intent suddenly arose behind Chu Feng. It was from Zhao Batian!<br>Zhao Batian was making use of the opening that Chu Feng exposed while turning around to launch a martial skill against him.<br>This martial skill manifested a single blade that carried overwhelming might. He was intending to take Chu Feng&rsquo;s life with this single strike!<br>However, Chu Feng was prepared for this. He swept the weapon in his hand backward and deflected that lethal strike.<br>Chu Feng was incredibly infuriated at this moment, but his expression simply became more impassive than before. Yet, it was exactly this impassive face that no one could read that instilled deep fear into the hearts of others.<br>&ldquo;I was intending to let you go, but you trampled all over my goodwill. You&rsquo;re going to have to pay the price for your folly,&rdquo; Chu Feng uttered as a bone-chilling murderous will gushed into the surroundings.<br>&ldquo;That lad&hellip; What terrifying killing intent!&rdquo;<br>Sensing the killing intent that was coming from Chu Feng, the juniors shuddered in fear and the elders frowned tightly in response.<br>The killing intent that was emanating from Chu Feng was so overpowering that the crowd felt as if they had been plunged into the midst of a tragic battlefield. There were rarely any cultivators that could emanate such terrifying killing intent, even amongst the demonic practitioners.<br>&ldquo;You want to kill me? Do you think that you have the capability to do so? Someone will die today, but it won&rsquo;t be me but you arrogant piece of trash!&rdquo; Zhao Batian bellowed furiously.<br>At the same time, he also released bursts of killing intent that gushed forth like relentless waves.<br>It was just that his killing intent appeared lacking in comparison to Chu Feng&rsquo;s, reminiscent of a dog attempting to revolt against a savage tiger. The disparity was extremely clear here, and it was only further driven in by the fact that Zhao Batian was no match for Chu Feng.<br>No matter how one looked at it, it felt like Zhao Batian was simply struggling in futility.<br>Boom!<br>A series of explosions suddenly sounded from Zhao Batian&rsquo;s body. It was originating from a blood-red mist that was spurting out from Zhao Batian&rsquo;s body like lava erupting from a volcano.<br>At the same time, Zhao Batian&rsquo;s eyes and skin turned blood-red. His muscles began bulging, and his physique expanded rapidly.<br>It was as if he had turned into a blood-red monster all of a sudden.<br>With these changes, his aura also turned many times more frightening than before, and his fighting prowess was enhanced by severalfold.<br>&ldquo;He consumed a forbidden medicine&hellip; But what a terrifying forbidden medicine that is!&rdquo;<br>The onlookers could easily tell the reason behind the changes that Zhao Batian was undergoing.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, are you insane? You don&rsquo;t need to go that far!&rdquo; Zhao Yuzhuo exclaimed out of worry.<br>He knew what that forbidden medicine was, and he knew just what kind of burden it would bring upon Zhao Batian&rsquo;s body.<br>&ldquo;No one can take away a woman who I, Zhao Batian, has laid my eyes on! I shall subdue this trash personally and snatch my woman back!&rdquo; Zhao Batian roared furiously as purple flames gushed out of his body.<br>Holding onto the Turquoiseflame Demon Saber tightly, he brandished it down on Chu Feng with great might.<br>&ldquo;Rank five Taboo Exalted, Purple Infernal Flames!&rdquo;<br>As the saber tore through the air, a powerful outpour of purple flame surged furiously toward Chu Feng as if a tsunami.<br>Tzlala!<br>On the other hand, blue lightning had begun crackling around Chu Feng as well. This was the hall protection treasure of the Yu Heavenly Clan, rank five Exalted Taboo, Soul of Heavenly Lightning!<br>The two martial skills clashed with one another, creating a sight that looked as if two devastating beasts were tearing each other apart. The shockwaves that rippled from the clash of power was incredibly destructive, laying waste onto everything that stood in its vicinity.<br>At first glance, it looked as if both powers were equally matched. But soon enough, the crowd realized that the blue lightning seemed to be even more domineering.<br>Like a charging dragon, it tore apart everything that stood in its path. Under the relentless charge of the blue lightning, the onslaught of purple flame soon started to unravel.<br>&ldquo;It seems like he&rsquo;s still unable to make it. He has consumed such a formidable forbidden medicine, but he&rsquo;s still no match for that lad.&rdquo;<br>The experts present could already tell that Chu Feng was still the stronger one of the two in this clash.<br></p></div>
