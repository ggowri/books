        <div>: The Fearsome Egg<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Long Xiaoxiao fell unconscious, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief arranged for Long Xiaoxiao to recuperate at a comfortable location.<br>As for where that location was, Chu Feng had no idea.<br>However, he didn&rsquo;t think that there was any need to worry about Long Xiaoxiao anymore. She was the future of the Dragon Clan, so the Dragon Clan would surely take care of her carefully as if she were a fragile treasure.<br>After settling Long Xiaoxiao down, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief also fulfilled the end of his bargain and brought Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist into the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Ground.<br>This time, with the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief leading the way personally, they were able to reach the entrance of their destination very smoothly, and with a special key that was in the possession of the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, they were able to enter the ground smoothly too.<br>From the outside, it looked as if the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Ground was just a mountain range.<br>However, when one entered the area, one would find that it was actually an individual world unto itself.<br>It was just that this world didn&rsquo;t have any mountains, rivers, grass, or trees.<br>It was as if they had entered a blank world.<br>However, this world was incredibly big, and there was a mystical aura drifting in the air.<br>The reason why the word &lsquo;mystical&rsquo; was used to describe it was that even though it wasn&rsquo;t as powerful as the aura from the Dragon Vein Source, there was an inexplicable divine vibe coming from it.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, you can rest assured. The two of us won&rsquo;t do anything detrimental to your Dragon Clan, even if it&rsquo;s out of consideration for Princess Xiaoxiao,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, I don&rsquo;t harbor any doubt toward you anymore. I just feel deeply embarrassed. Remember, the entrance and the exit are over here. If you wish to leave, you can do so through here.<br>&ldquo;Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s condition still hasn&rsquo;t stabilized yet, so I&rsquo;m still a little worried. I&rsquo;m heading out first to take a look at her.&rdquo;<br>After saying his piece, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief turned around and left the area.<br>In truth, this was an intentional move on his part. He wanted to express his trust toward Chu Feng and his master so as to make up for what he had done before.<br>That being said, Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had already seen through his intention. After all, how could the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief possibly be an honest man?<br>Being in his position, he had no choice but to prioritize the interests of the Dragon Clan above everything else.<br>Given that Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s condition still wasn&rsquo;t stable yet, there was a good chance that they might need the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s help in the future. Considering how the Dragon Clan hadn&rsquo;t left a favorable impression on the latter thus far, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief felt that there was a need for him to improve relations a little.<br>On top of that, there was actually nothing in the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Ground either. So even if Chu Feng and his master wanted to pull something off, there was nothing they could do.<br>Finally, after they were left alone, Chu Feng voiced his doubts. &ldquo;Master, were you the one who caused the Dragon Vein Source inside Princess Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s body to disappear?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist shook his head as he replied, refuting Chu Feng&rsquo;s guess.<br>However, a moment later, he added, &ldquo;However, I did know that the Dragon Vein Source would soon show itself. That being said, I did lie to the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief on certain matters. For one, whether Princess Xiaoxiao successfully assimilates the Dragon Vein Source or not has nothing to do with the injuries Long Mumu and her mother dealt to her.&rdquo;<br>As the Ox-nosed Old Daoist spoke, an evil smile curled on his lips.<br>&ldquo;As expected, everything was within master&rsquo;s grasp all this while,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;It was convenient for us anyway. We could help your friend eliminate her enemies, and at the same time, we were able to make the Dragon Clan indebted to us. Isn&rsquo;t it a win-win situation?<br>&ldquo;Of course, it was all dependent on the cooperation of Long Mumu and her mother too. If they hadn&rsquo;t been so desperate as to make a move on Princess Xiaoxiao as soon as the opportunity surfaced, they might have been able to live for a while longer,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist replied.<br>&ldquo;Master, in your view, do you think that Xiaoxiao will be able to assimilate with the power of the Dragon Vein Source?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was still very worried about Long Xiaoxiao. After all, this concerned her life and death.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any problem with it,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist replied.<br>With this, Chu Feng&rsquo;s unsettled heart finally calmed down.<br>He still trusted his master&rsquo;s judgment quite a bit. Since his master said that it was fine, that was very likely to be the case.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about others and end up forgetting about your own affairs,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist reminded him.<br>&ldquo;Master, what do we do now?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked as he took out the Qilin&rsquo;s egg.<br>Weng!<br>However, as soon as the Qilin egg was brought out, a powerful burst of energy pulsated out from it, pushing not only Chu Feng but even the Ox-nosed Old Daoist back.<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist was forced to retreat several steps, but Chu Feng was sent flying several kilometers away.<br>Even though he didn&rsquo;t sustain any injuries, the powerful shockwave still caused his heart to tighten as he began to worry.<br>He could sense a series of changes occurring within the Qilin&rsquo;s egg that left him a little apprehensive. The egg was starting to release a terrifying aura.<br>This aura slowly manifested into powerful bursts of energy that rippled outward continuously, pushing away everything around it.<br>Putting aside Chu Feng, even the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was knocked back further and further. They couldn&rsquo;t approach the Qilin&rsquo;s egg at all.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, hurry up and get away from the egg!&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist suddenly bellowed furiously.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng quickly backed a few hundred meters away.<br>&ldquo;Stop dawdling over there! I&rsquo;m asking you to back away! Retreat till you can&rsquo;t see the Qilin&rsquo;s egg anymore!&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist shouted.<br>&ldquo;Master, what about you?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng dared not hesitate. He quickly acted as per the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s instructions, though he was a little worried about him.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, nothing will happen to me.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist floated into the air.<br>He placed his palms together and began channeling the mystic energy within this world into his body.<br></p></div>
