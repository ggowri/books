        <h1>Chapter 2670</h1>
        <div> - Looking Forward To Being Alive<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;After Chu Xuanyuan defeated the Dao Imperial Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master, he retired from his position as the Law Enforcement Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master and left the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Once he left, he left for over eight hundred years.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There was no correspondence from him for over eight hundred years straight. No one knew where he went, and no one knew what he had experienced.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;When he returned again, he brought an infant back with him. That infant was Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng is Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son, Chu Hanxian&rsquo;s grandson. Back then, the entire Starfield was shaken by his appearance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason for that was because Chu Feng had inherited the strongest bloodline of our Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Experts from various regions all arrived at our Chu Heavenly Clan to see exactly what sort of talent Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son would have.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of that, our clan soon prepared the talent test for Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That talent test could be said to be the most magnificent and unprecedented of all the talent tests conducted by our clan. It was truly bustling with noise and excitement.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Everyone was filled with anticipation. Merely&hellip;&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Chu Xuanzhengfa started to sigh. He had a helpless expression on his face.<br>&ldquo;You also know the result. It was revealed that Chu Feng did not possess any talent for martial cultivation, and was determined to be trash, unable to partake in martial cultivation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Everyone was greatly disappointed by this. Some even started to insult Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for Chu Xuanyuan, how could he allow his own son to be insulted? He was enraged by the insults, and killed all those who insulted Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, the great majority of those people were our Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s distinguished guests. There were even people from the Starfield Master Realm among those that he killed. They were people that not even our Chu Heavenly Clan could afford to offend.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For the sake of alleviating the various powers&rsquo; anger and presenting an explanation to the Starfield Master Realm, our clan had no choice but to banish Chu Xuanyuan and Chu Feng. Furthermore, we bestowed severe punishment upon them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Actually, based on the situation back then, it was already a miracle that Chu Xuanyuan was able to survive.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, Chu Xuanyuan did not resist when our clan wanted to severely punish him. Just like that, he allowed himself to be captured.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Many people felt that Chu Xuanyuan did not dare to resist because he knew that he was no match for our Chu Heavenly Clan and the various distinguished guests.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I do not feel that to be the case. I was also present at the time. I witnessed the expression in his eyes. There was not the slightest bit of fear in his eyes,&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, it would mean that he accepted the punishment willingly. But&hellip; why would he do that? Even if he did not wish to make an enemy of our clan, he could&rsquo;ve escaped. Why would he decide to accept the punishment?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi asked.<br>&ldquo;Who knows? He has always been an unfathomable individual since he was a child. Even I, your father, was never able to see through him,&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa shook his head.<br>At that moment, Chu Lingxi grew silent.<br>&ldquo;Lingxi, you couldn&rsquo;t have been shocked, right?&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa asked with a smile.<br>He knew that his daughter was a very conceited girl. It was indeed very possible for her to be shocked after hearing about Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s past deeds.<br>After all, regardless of how strong a genius might be, they would all be unworthy of being mentioned when compared against Chu Xuanyuan.<br>&ldquo;Suddenly, I hope that Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son is still alive,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said.<br>&ldquo;Why is that?&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.<br>&ldquo;Due to the difference in age, I am destined to be unable to compare against Chu Xuanyuan. However, if his son is still alive, I will be able to compare myself against him,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said.<br>&ldquo;Perhaps you will have that opportunity,&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa said.<br>&ldquo;Father, could it be that you feel that Chu Feng to still be alive? That he did not die after being devoured by his Demon Armament?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi asked.<br>&ldquo;I do not know whether Chu Feng is still alive or not. However, if that Chu Feng is really Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son, I dare to guarantee that he will most definitely be still alive,&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa said.<br>&ldquo;Why is that?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi asked.<br>&ldquo;Merely because he is Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son, Chu Hanxian&rsquo;s grandson,&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa said.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Lingxi went quiet for a moment. However, soon, a beautiful smile emerged on her face.<br>Furthermore, anticipation filled her beautiful eyes.<br>&hellip;...<br>While Chu Lingxi and Chu Xuanzhengfa were conversing with one another, Chu Huai and Chu Yue had been standing outside the Great Law Enforcement Hall.<br>Chu Yue had been staring at the entrance of the Great Law Enforcement Hall the entire time. She did not even blink once.<br>Judging from their appearance, it seemed like they were waiting for someone. As for the person that they were waiting for, it would either be Chu Xuanzhengfa or Chu Lingxi.<br>After all, only Chu Xuanzhengfa and Chu Lingxi remained in the palace hall.<br>Finally, the entrance to the palace hall opened, and Chu Lingxi walked out from it.<br>Chu Lingxi obviously took notice of Chu Huai and Chu Yue. However, she did not even bother to take a glance at them. Instead, she began to walk away directly.<br>&ldquo;Lingxi,&rdquo; Seeing that, Chu Yue hurriedly shouted and then rushed toward her.<br>Hearing Chu Yue&rsquo;s shout, Chu Lingxi stopped and turned around to look toward Chu Yue.<br>Her gaze was truly cold and detached. She simply did not seem to be seeing someone from her same clan, a relative. Instead, she was looking at Chu Yue as if she were seeing a stranger.<br>&ldquo;You need something?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi asked in a slightly annoyed manner.<br>&ldquo;Lingxi, I&rsquo;ve heard that you&rsquo;ve been to the Daytime Upper Realm this time around and completed the hunting mission in the Daytime Upper Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You are simply too amazing. You must know that that mission had been set in place for seven hundred years now. Yet, no one has been able to accomplish it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, you&rsquo;ve accomplished it. You are simply the number one genius in our Chu Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; Chu Yue declared with a joyous expression on her face. She was truly delighted. It was as if she was the one that had accomplished the mission.<br>However, Chu Lingxi did not appreciate Chu Yue&rsquo;s praise in the slightest. Instead, she cast a disdain-filled glance at Chu Yue. Then, without saying any more, she continued to walk away.<br>Chu Yue felt very awkward. However, she did not give up. Instead, she took out a small jade case from her Cosmos Sack.<br>That jade case was of considerable value. Furthermore, it was meticulously decorated. Likely, the item contained inside would be extraordinary.<br>With the jade case in her hand, Chu Yue chased after Chu Lingxi, &ldquo;Lingxi, this is a present that I&rsquo;ve brought back from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm for you. Please don&rsquo;t mind it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry but I do mind, greatly,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi turned around and left those words. Then, she continued walking around without a second thought.<br>At that moment, Chu Huai who was still standing where he was started to frown. He revealed a displeased expression.<br>The reason for that was because he had noticed that Chu Lingxi did not even bother to take a glance at the present Chu Yue prepared for her. Just like that, she turned her back toward Chu Yue.<br>How could this be minding and disliking the present? Chu Lingxi was simply feeling that Chu Yue was beneath her.<br>However, even though Chu Yue was left in an awkward situation, she did not reveal any clear sort of gloominess. Just like that, she put the jade case she held in her hand away.<br>&ldquo;Chu Yue, why must you do this to yourself? Although we are from the same clan, people like Chu Lingxi are simply from a different world from us. Why must you always act like this toward them?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you just asking to be to snubbed by them?&rdquo; Chu Huai stepped forward and asked Chu Yue.<br>He was slightly angry. However, it seemed that he was not only angry toward Chu Lingxi, but he was also angry at Chu Yue.<br>&ldquo;How could I not know that? I know that I am going to be snubbed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, even if this is the case, I must still continue to do this, for this is an opportunity for me to change my destiny,&rdquo; Chu Yue said in a very determined manner.<br>This time around, Chu Huai did not say anything. Merely, a sort of gaze emerged in his eyes.<br>It was a gaze of disappointment.<br>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;...<br>An enormous change occurred to the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm after experiencing that catastrophe.<br>The catastrophe had not only inflicted disastrous losses to all the sects and schools, but it had inflicted disastrous losses to the entire Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>However, the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm did not grow peaceful because of that. Instead, it became even more chaotic.<br>The reason for that was because the great majority of those people that had survived the catastrophe were people with great ambitions. They began to take advantage of the situation to seize territories, and were stirring up wars nonstop.<br>The catastrophe completely altered the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>As for the allied army, it was originally composed of elites from various schools and sects. However, after the catastrophe, those people managed to see a lot of things clearly. Thus, after the allied army was disbanded, many of them decided to directly join Hero City.<br>They felt that only the people from Hero City were their kindred spirits.<br>Furthermore, Hero City had once again become the most popular power in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. Many of the survivors all wanted to join Hero City.<br>The reason for that was because Hero City was the only &lsquo;pure land&rsquo; that remained in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>However, Hero City no longer allowed anyone to join it.<br>If one wanted to become a member of Hero City, one&rsquo;s cultivation would no longer be the most crucial matter. Instead, one&rsquo;s character had become the most crucial aspect. This caused the great majority of people to stay outside Hero City, unable to enter.<br>During this period of time, Chu Feng did not do anything. He had been accompanying his friends in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm the entire time.<br>He enjoyed alcohol with them and talked endlessly. In fact, they would even go sightseeing.<br>Day and night, they enjoyed themselves.<br>The reason why Chu Feng was doing this was because he had accomplished all that he had to do.<br>Chu Feng was planning to leave the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. Once he left, he had no idea when he would be able to return.<br>Thus, he wanted to properly accompany his friends who had helped and journeyed with him in the past.<br><br></p></div>
