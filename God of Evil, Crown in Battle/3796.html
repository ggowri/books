        <h1>Chapter 3795</h1>
        <div> - Chu Feng&rsquo;s Friend?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you all inquiring about Ma Liang&rsquo;s whereabouts, and intending to obtain justice for him?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Now that you know that Ma Liang was killed by me, how are you planning to settle this debt?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Milord, this is a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We truly had no idea that Ma Liang had died. We were merely using his disappearance as a random excuse. We truly didn&rsquo;t come to attack you, Milord," said the Cloud Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster.<br>&ldquo;A random excuse? In that case, did you know that the Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster is my friend?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I had no idea. I truly had no idea.&rdquo;<br>The Cloud Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster became extremely nervous. The Lord Headmaster, a grand existence in the Seven Suns Mountain Range region, was so terrified that he was about to pee his pants.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that he lacked courage. Rather, he truly did not want to die.<br>He also knew very well that the person before him was someone that he could not afford to offend.<br>&ldquo;Forget it. I will not make things difficult for you, you can stand back up.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng waved his hand.<br>&ldquo;Thank you Milord. Thank you Milord.&rdquo;<br>The Cloud Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster nodded and bowed repeatedly. He kowtowed to Chu Feng for a very long time before finally standing up.<br>After standing up, he wiped the cold sweat off his face repeatedly. Even now, his body was still trembling. He was truly terrified.<br>&ldquo;Headmaster Yang, you are truly unkind and insincere. If you had told me that such a grand existence was backing you up, I, Yun, would never have dared to cause trouble for you," said the Cloud Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster.<br>&ldquo;What are you&hellip;&rdquo; The Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster didn&rsquo;t know how to respond to those words.<br>He was feeling very wronged. After all, he hadn&rsquo;t known that Chu Feng was so powerful either. Besides, he didn&rsquo;t know Chu Feng very well at all.<br>Besides, even if he told the Cloud Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster that, would he possibly believe him?<br>If the Cloud Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster hadn&rsquo;t witnessed Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength with his own eyes, he would not be reacting in such a manner.<br>&ldquo;Headmaster Yun, now that you know about the relationship that the Watermirror Paradise and I have, are you still going to cause trouble for them in the future?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t dare. I wouldn&rsquo;t dare. Milord, even if you are to give me a hundred times the nerve, I would still not dare,&rdquo; said the Cloud Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng smiled. Then, he said, &ldquo;Headmaster Yun, I will ask you a question.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Milord, please ask away," said the Cloud Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster.<br>&ldquo;How long has your Cloud Paradise existed?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Milord, our Cloud Paradise has existed for forty-three thousand eight hundred years exactly. Over these forty-thousand plus years, we have had a total of fifteen headmasters,&rdquo; the Cloud Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster answered in full detail.<br>&ldquo;Listen carefully. You&rsquo;d best behave yourself properly from today on. Not to mention not bullying the Watermirror Paradise, you are not allowed to bully people from any powers.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Otherwise&hellip; I will have your Cloud Paradise&rsquo;s continued existence cease in your generation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Understand?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng coldly.<br>&ldquo;Understood. Understood.&rdquo;<br>The Cloud Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster nodded his head repeatedly. The sweat that he had wiped away had once again covered his face. In fact, there was even more sweat than before.<br>What Chu Feng had said was no threat. Instead, it was a warning.<br>Killing intent had appeared in Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes as he said those words. That killing intent was the most intense and most terrifying killing intent he had ever seen.<br>In that instant, he saw the scene of his Cloud Paradise being completely extinguished.<br>Thus, he knew that Chu Feng was most definitely not lying. If he dared to commit any misdeeds, this seemingly ordinary-looking fellow would really bring ruin upon his Cloud Paradise.<br>&ldquo;Enough. You can scram,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Milord, I&rsquo;ll take my leave then.&rdquo;<br>The Cloud Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster hurriedly brought the people from the Cloud Paradise with him and left.<br>They left very quickly. However, their appearance looked very sorry.<br>&ldquo;Sssss~~~&rdquo;<br>Luo Zhi and the others that were hiding in the shadows and observing everything were unable to keep themselves from sucking in a mouthful of cold air.<br>Earlier, they&rsquo;d witnessed with their very eyes the person that they considered to be a peak grand expert shivering in fear, kneeling and begging Chu Feng for forgiveness.<br>That scene had an enormous effect on their hearts. It left an indelible shadow in their hearts.<br>They had always dreamed of being able to get close to the Cloud Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster or the Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster.<br>However, At a short while before, an existence even more powerful than the Cloud Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster was right beside them; addressing them as brothers.<br>As for them, not only did they not cherish that opportunity, but they instead only planned to harm that person.<br>It was only at that moment that they realized how foolish they were.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, you&rsquo;re still here?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There seemed to be a fight earlier. I was very worried for you, are you alright?&rdquo;<br>Luo Zhi walked out from the private room he was hiding in and walked to Chu Feng with a look of cordial eagerness on his face. He seemed like he'd seen his close friend of many years.<br>Luo Zhi was trying to mend the pen after the sheep were lost. He wanted to seize the opportunity to better his relationship with CHu Feng.<br>Even if he failed to establish a relationship with Chu Feng, he wanted to use the title of &lsquo;Chu Feng&rsquo;s close friend&rsquo; to establish good relations with the Watermirror Paradise. Should that happen, it would definitely be an enormous profit for him.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, are you alright?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why are you still there?&rdquo;<br>Seeing Luo Zhi showing himself, the others also learned from his behavior, and ran over to Chu Feng attentively.<br>Even Wang Lian shamelessly ran over.<br>However, even though they acted so eagerly attentive, Chu Feng paid absolutely no attention to them. He acted as if he had not heard their shouts.<br>That said, those people were simply thick-skinned to the extreme. Even though he was ignoring them, they still inquiried about Chu Feng&rsquo;s well-being nonstop.<br>Seeing that the situation seemed amiss, Yang Shenshen asked, &ldquo;Senior Asura, do you know them?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would be better to ask your Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s disciples whether or not I know them.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng looked to the several Watermirror Paradise disciples kneeling nearby.<br>Those people were Miao Yu&rsquo;s lackeys. All of them were present when Miao Yu had captured Li Chuchu.<br>Thus, they&rsquo;d all witnessed the scene earlier.<br>&ldquo;Milord, how should we respond?&rdquo;<br>After witnessing how powerful Chu Feng was, he was already a living god of death in their eyes.<br>They felt endless fear towards Chu Feng. They were even more afraid of him than their Lord Headmaster.<br>When Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze turned to them, they thought that he was planning to kill them. Thus, they truly did not know how to answer him.<br>&ldquo;What happened earlier and what you all saw earlier, just tell them as they happened," said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Senior Asura is asking you whether or not these people are his friends.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Speak, and honestly! Why ask all these questions?!&rdquo; Yang Shenshen shouted in annoyance.<br></p></div>
