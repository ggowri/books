        <div> - Definitely Not A Coincidence<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Brother Wuma, you know me well, I am not someone who jokes around.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I am naturally serious in my proposal,&rdquo; the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu, it would truly be great if you&rsquo;re willing to help,&rdquo; after confirming it, the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder was simply overjoyed. He acted as if he had seen his savior.<br>&ldquo;Brother Wuma, are you able to find those two girls?&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu, those two girls possess extraordinary power. The two of them were able to easily escape; thus, how could they possibly leave clues for us to find them?&rdquo; When mentioning that matter, that Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder started to have a bad headache.<br>&ldquo;In that case, do you know of their origin?&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder shook his head.<br>&ldquo;Then do you have a plan to handle them?&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder shook his head again.<br>&ldquo;Brother Wuma, how am I supposed to help you then?&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief felt very helpless.<br>He had arrived with Chu Feng for the sake of obtaining information regarding Su Rou and Su Mei from the Wuma Heavenly Clan. However, judging from the situation, the Wuma Heavenly Clan did not have any information at all.<br>&ldquo;Currently, we can only wait idly for them to come at us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, our clan has many territories with resources in the Scarlet Province Upper Realm. As such, we do not know which territory they will attack. Most importantly, they used to attack us and rob us frequently. However, in the recent days, they&rsquo;ve suddenly slowed down, so much so that we do not even know if the two of them are still in the Scarlet Province Upper Realm,&rdquo; the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder said.<br>&ldquo;Brother Wuma, if that is the case, how am I supposed to help you?&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief revealed a helpless look.<br>&ldquo;The people of our Law Enforcement Hall have been searching for traces of those two girls the entire time. If we are able to find them, I hope that brother Chu would be willing to help us,&rdquo; that Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder said.<br>&ldquo;Definitely,&rdquo; the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was actually feeling very helpless. The Moon Immortal that had occupied the bodies of Su Rou and Su Mei was actually able to defeat even a Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder. With this, how could the people from their Law Enforcement Hall possibly be able to handle her?<br>As such, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief did not have much hope in the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Law Enforcement Hall. He had come to a decision that he would personally investigate the matter.<br>Thus, he said, &ldquo;Since I&rsquo;ve agreed to help, then&hellip; I will personally investigate this matter too, I hope that I will be able to find some clues.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re willing, that would naturally be even better. Brother Chu, you are truly a close friend of our clan chief. I truly do not know how to thank you,&rdquo; the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder had a grateful expression.<br>&ldquo;Lord Supreme Elder!&rdquo; Right at that moment, an elder&rsquo;s voice sounded from outside the palace entrance.<br>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s something, you can tell me later! Did you not see that I&rsquo;m currently receiving important guests?!&rdquo; The Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder spoke in a very displeased manner.<br>&ldquo;Lord Supreme Elder, this subordinate has something very important that I must report to you,&rdquo; that elder repeated himself.<br>Hearing those words, the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder&rsquo;s expression changed slightly. Then, he clasped his fist at the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and said, &ldquo;Brother Chu, please wait a moment.&rdquo;<br>After he finished saying those words, he exited the palace hall.<br>Not long afterward, he returned to the palace hall.<br>However, when he returned, he had a joyous expression on his face. It was as if something very good had happened.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu, even the heavens are helping us. We&rsquo;ve discovered the whereabouts of those two girls,&rdquo; the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder said.<br>&ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re over by the Multitude Spirits Mountain Range. Brother Chu, if you&rsquo;re willing, I can accompany you there to capture those two girls right now,&rdquo; the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder said.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go immediately,&rdquo; the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Is this young friend also going to accompany us?&rdquo; The Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder asked.<br>&ldquo;Is there an issue?&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>Although the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder was very cordial toward Chu Feng because he was accompanying the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, he had never bothered to look him in the eyes the entire time, and had never attempted to ask his name.<br>That had caused the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief some discomfort.<br>After all, this meant that the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder looked down on their Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations. That was the reason why he did not pay any attention to Chu Feng. He felt that he was not qualified for him to face squarely.<br>If the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder treated someone else that way, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief wouldn&rsquo;t care much about it. However, as it was Chu Feng that was being treated that way, this caused the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief displeasure.<br>After all, he valued Chu Feng enormously, and had deemed him to be the hope of their Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no issue at all,&rdquo; seeing that the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had revealed a trace of displeasure in his tone, the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder immediately smiled. He seemed to have realized that Chu Feng held some weight in the Chu Heavenly Clan, and took a head-on look at Chu Feng.<br>That said, he did not attempt to say much of anything. Instead, he directly turned around and began to guide the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Enroute, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief sent a voice transmission to Chu Feng. The reason for that was because he noticed that Chu Feng was acting slightly strange.<br>There were things that he did not wish for the people from the Wuma Heavenly Clan to know. That was the reason why he sent a voice transmission to converse with Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Senior, I wonder if it&rsquo;s a coincidence.&rdquo;<br>Receiving the voice transmission, Chu Feng replied through voice transmission, &ldquo;These days, I&rsquo;ve been studying the map recorded on that Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram the entire time. According to my analysis, the mysterious place recorded in that Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram is located in the Scarlet Province Upper Realm, at a place called the Multitude Spirits Mountain Range.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s actually such a thing?&rdquo; At that moment, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s heart grew tense.<br>He finally realized why Chu Feng acted slightly strange after he found out about the location they were headed to.<br>Anyone would not be able to help themself but ponder if it was really a coincidence for the Moon Immortal, who had robbed numerous resources, to appear in the Multitude Spirits Mountain Range, the location of the mysterious place.<br>Suddenly, that Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder turned around and said, &ldquo;Brother Chu, there is one thing that I must inform you about.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Wuma, what is it?&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>&ldquo;Regarding the remnant that our clan discovered in the Scarlet Province Upper Realm that I mentioned to you about earlier, that remnant is located precisely in the Multitude Spirits Mountain Range,&rdquo; the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder said.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, both Chu Feng and the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief were greatly alarmed. Then, unable to contain themselves, the two of them glanced at one another.<br>They did not say anything, as they&rsquo;d already managed to converse with each other through their gazes.<br>All of this was definitely not a coincidence.<br></p></div>
