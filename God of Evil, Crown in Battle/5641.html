        <h1>Chapter 5641: Dead End</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Let&rsquo;s go too.&rdquo; Chu Feng looked at Xiao Yueyue before heading in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person dressed in a world spiritist robe was so fast that most juniors failed to notice them, so most people thought that Chu Feng and Xiao Yueyue were the first ones to enter the Nine Heavens Secret Domain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Look, it&rsquo;s Chu Feng! It&rsquo;s that Chu Feng!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng&rsquo;s movements stirred a huge commotion due to the attention that was already on him. Most people even thought that he was the strongest candidate in the entrance examination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His initiative spurred a chain reaction, as the other juniors hurriedly followed him. They thought that they would be safer following him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng would have usually rushed ahead, knowing how important it was to clinch the initiative inside a remnant. However, he knew better than to underestimate the Nine Heavens Secret Domain, which was why he slowly advanced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beyond the towering gates leading into the Nine Heavens Secret Domain was a narrow path through a mountainous valley surrounded by steep cliffs. The crowd felt a force binding them to the ground. They could rise into the air, but there was a limit to their flight altitude that prevented them from flying higher than the steep cliffs around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was impossible for them to fly up into the sky and catch a bird&rsquo;s eye look over the Nine Heavens Secret Domain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Along the way, Chu Feng&rsquo;s group didn&rsquo;t encounter any traps or ferocious beasts. They soon arrived at a split fork that diverged into three paths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Why are there three paths?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked Xiao Yueyue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was stated in the scroll they received from Elder Zhenfu that the leftmost path was for elders whereas the rightmost path was for juniors. They were supposed to take the rightmost path. This led Chu Feng into thinking that there were only two paths, but it turned out that there were three paths instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>You may try the middle one,&rdquo; Xiao Yueyue said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng activated his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes to take a closer look at the middle path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>It&rsquo;s fine. Look at this,&rdquo; Xiao Yueyue said as she rushed toward the middle path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body vanished into thin air as soon as she stepped into the middle path, as if her earlier presence was just an illusion. However, there was a surge of teleportation energy right after, and she reappeared in front of the middle path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Did you see that?&rdquo; Xiao Yueyue asked with a chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng stepped forward and put his hand through the invisible barrier over the middle path. He could sense that the barrier was an incredibly powerful protective </span><span>formation that prevented anyone from entering its premises. Anyone who stepped through the barrier would be teleported back just like Xiao Yueyue did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Is this route closed?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Xiao Yueyue could answer the question, a fair-skinned woman with a slender waist and long legs walked up to Chu Feng and gently smiled at him, saying, </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span>This route has always been closed. Thus far, no one has been able to find a way to enter this route.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xiao Yueyue bared her killing intent at the woman, saying, </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Scram! Why are you butting into our conversation?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised her palm and thrust it at the woman&rsquo;s face. She was planning to kill the latter!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng quickly pulled the woman behind her back while stopping Xiao Yueyue&rsquo;s attack by grabbing her wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>What are you doing?&rdquo; Xiao Yueyue was angry to see Chu Feng stopping her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Is there a grudge between the two of you?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Young master Chu Feng, I don&rsquo;t know Miss Xiao,&rdquo; the woman said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>I&rsquo;m not asking you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said before turning back to Xiao Yueyue. </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Do you have a grudge with her?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>None at all,&rdquo; Xiao Yueyue replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Why do you want to take her life then?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked. He was not a soft-hearted person, but he didn&rsquo;t believe in wilfully taking the life of others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>What do you mean by that, Chu Feng? I am your partner!&rdquo; Xiao Yueyue exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Then you should know that I won&rsquo;t allow you to take the life of innocent people,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Take the life of innocent people? Women like her deserve to die! Chu Feng, I didn&rsquo;t expect you to be a lustful man! We should call off our partnership since our values diverge,&rdquo; Xiao Yueyue snorted with a wave of her sleeves before marching off to Chu Feng&rsquo;s route.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng had no idea why Xiao Yueyue was so angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>My apologies, young hero Chu Feng. I didn&rsquo;t mean to anger Miss Xiao. I was just&hellip;&rdquo; the woman apologized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>The two of you really don&rsquo;t know each other?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>We are really unacquainted. I swear on it,&rdquo; the woman raised her hand as she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Forget it.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng figured that Xiao Yueyue had her reason behind reacting like that, but he couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to think too deeply into it since he wasn&rsquo;t close with her anyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took another look at the middle path, as he couldn&rsquo;t help but think that it might hold the crux to the Nine Heavens Secret Domain. However, there was no point wasting too much time on it since he couldn&rsquo;t find an opening in it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, he made his way toward the junior&rsquo;s route. The other juniors followed him, but he abruptly halted his footsteps and turned to look at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>We&rsquo;re rivals here since we are competing in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s entrance examination, but I believe many of you simply wish to survive this ordeal. You may come with me, but you&rsquo;ll have to clear my trial,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he </span><span>constructed a triangular formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The formation contained three doors. One of them was an entrance facing the crowd, whereas the other two were exits leading toward Chu Feng&rsquo;s left and right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Those who wish to come with me may enter the formation and accept my trial. Those who aren&rsquo;t interested may go on their own path,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Young master Chu Feng, I wish to come with you.&rdquo; The fair-skinned woman took the lead and stepped into the formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Young hero Chu Feng, take me with you as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>I&rsquo;m grateful to young master Chu Feng for providing us with this opportunity.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More and more people stepped into the formation, but they were in the minority. Most people chose neither to step into the formation nor advance. They wanted to watch the situation first. They didn&rsquo;t trust Chu Feng, so they didn&rsquo;t know if he had tampered with the formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of them started leaving the formation, but most of them came out from the right exit. Less than a tenth of them came out from the left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng looked at the crowd that came out from the right and said, </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span>We aren&rsquo;t fated to be. You may leave now.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Young hero Chu Feng, what do you mean by this?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>You know very well what I mean. We aren&rsquo;t the same type of people. It wouldn&rsquo;t be wise for us to travel together,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His formation was basically an illusory formation that forced those who stepped into it to make a decision. The goal was to test their character. Those who had exited from the right were selfish people who prioritized their own interests over others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Chu Feng, aren&rsquo;t you too cold-blooded?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>It&rsquo;s out of respect for you that we&rsquo;re willing to travel with you. Don&rsquo;t you think that you&rsquo;re getting ahead of yourself?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>You seem to think that we can&rsquo;t survive without you. You think too highly of yourself!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them even shoved his finger at Chu Feng and berated him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng flitted over and punched right through the person&rsquo;s body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was taken aback, particularly because that person was dead. Chu Feng had killed him just because that person had berated him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>I never said that I wasn&rsquo;t cold-blooded.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng coldly eyed that person&rsquo;s corpse before jolting his arm, reducing the latter&rsquo;s body into dust. With smooth movements, he gathered that person&rsquo;s origin energies and treasures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd turned pale in horror. They hadn&rsquo;t expected Chu Feng to be this callous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng was the only one who knew that person was a serial murderer who enjoyed torturing the innocent, as shown through the illusory formation. He would have turned a blind eye to it if that person had quietly walked away, but since the latter wanted to cause a scene, there was no reason for him to condone him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, there was no saying what that person might do behind his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t afraid of that person, but there was no reason for him to spare someone who harbored enmity toward him.</span></p></div>
