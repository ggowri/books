        <div>: Important Matter<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster kept saying that she wasn&rsquo;t going to interfere in his affairs, she had been helping him all this while.<br>The Godwish Grandmother was at rank nine Martial Exalted level, and she had the power to raise her cultivation by an additional rank on top of that. That put her on equal standing with Master Yin Ren.<br>While Shengguang Buyu had returned to the Holy Valley to invite the Holy Monarch to help him deal with Master Yin Ren and the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, Chu Feng knew that it would take quite some time.<br>After all, the Holy Monarch was still in closed-door training at the moment. They wouldn&rsquo;t disturb the Holy Monarch in the midst of his training.<br>However, Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s life was in grave danger. Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t afford to wait here.<br>It would be best if the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo; sectmaster was willing to intervene, but that didn&rsquo;t seem to be the case. It was likely that the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster was present too back when they were threatened by Master Yin Ren, but she chose not to make a move.<br>That was more than enough to show that she had no intention of getting involved here.<br>As such, it was good that Chu Feng was able to enlist the help of the Godwish Grandmother.<br>After some discussion, it was decided that the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster would bring Zi Ling and Yaoyao back to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect with her whereas Shengguang Baimei, Daoist Niantian, the Godwish Grandmother,<br>Lady of Dao Sea, and Song Yun would travel together with Chu Feng.<br>As for Wang Yuxian and the other disciples of the Dao Sea, they were told to head to another location and wait there for<br>Lady of Dao Sea.<br>Song Xue&rsquo;er wanted to follow them as well, but the Godwish Grandmother forbade it. Left with no choice, she could only return first.<br>Before parting ways, Chu Feng requested for some private time with Zi Ling. He wanted to probe the Blood-red Ancient Tower in Zi Ling&rsquo;s body to see if he could help her open the first door. A small crack had indeed appeared in the door on the first level of the tower, but he wasn&rsquo;t able to discern anything aside from that.<br>In fact, he didn&rsquo;t even sense the same intuition that Zi Ling felt.<br>That made him realize that Zi Ling only had herself to count on when it came to the affairs relating to the Blood-red Ancient Tower.<br>As reluctant as they were, the moment of separation still came.<br>The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster first took her leave. Yaoyao couldn&rsquo;t bear to part ways with Chu Feng and even kicked up a fuss due to that. In the end, she got tired and fell asleep in Zi Ling&rsquo;s arms. It appeared that she had a good impression of Zi Ling.<br>&ldquo;Let me carry that lass.&rdquo;<br>The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster took Yaoyao away from Zi Ling&rsquo;s grasp. She could hardly conceal the fondness in her eyes as she looked at Yaoyao&rsquo;s adorable face.<br>&ldquo;Zi Ling, you&rsquo;ll have to work hard. Yaoyao isn&rsquo;t anyone ordinary. She could very well surpass you in the future,&rdquo; the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster said.<br>&ldquo;Master, are you intending on taking Yaoyao in as your disciple?&rdquo; Zi Ling asked.<br>&ldquo;It would be best if such talent could join our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, but I&rsquo;ll allow her to choose for herself. She&rsquo;s still young at the moment, so we&rsquo;ll talk about this when she grows older,&rdquo; the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster said.<br>&ldquo;Master, is big brother Chu Feng going to do something dangerous?&rdquo; Zi Ling asked.<br>She had no idea what Chu Feng was going to do, and that was why she was worried about it.<br>&ldquo;He previously left the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect to save a girl, and now he&rsquo;s going to risk his life to save another girl. Your big brother Chu Feng sure has many sweethearts he&rsquo;s willing to risk his life for,&rdquo; the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster sneered in disdain.<br>&ldquo;Master&hellip; can you help big brother Chu Feng on this matter? He&rsquo;s a disciple of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect too!&rdquo; Zi Ling said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s his personal affair. He should resolve it with his own strength,&rdquo; the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster replied coldly.<br>Since the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster had already made her stance clear, Zi Ling wasn&rsquo;t in a good position to continue pushing the matter. She knew how obstinate her master could be once she had made up her mind.<br>&ldquo;Remember, Zi Ling. Before you learn to love someone, you should learn to love yourself first. You have been thinking from Chu Feng&rsquo;s position all this while. It&rsquo;s time for you to start learning how to think for yourself. I can tell that Chu Feng does harbor feelings for you, but he&rsquo;s not a devoted man. He has far too many outstanding women surrounding him.<br>&ldquo;To be very frank, your talent doesn&rsquo;t match up to his either. If you wish to maintain your relationship with him, you&rsquo;ll have to keep up with his footsteps. You mustn&rsquo;t fall behind the others. Otherwise, the nature of your relationship will inevitably change. A person standing at the foot of the mountain won&rsquo;t be able to speak on equal terms with a person standing on its peak,&rdquo; the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster said.<br>&ldquo;Thank you for your advice, master. However, I trust that Chu Feng won&rsquo;t look down on me loftily from the top of the mountain. He&rsquo;ll fly down and talk to me face to face,&rdquo; Zi Ling replied with a confident smile.<br>&ldquo;It sure is good to be young.&rdquo;<br>The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster shook her head helplessly.<br>On the other hand, Wang Yuxian had left with her seniors from the Dao Sea too, leaving just Chu Feng, the Godwish Grandmother, and the others on the spot.<br>&ldquo;Junior Chu Feng, I was unaware of your and Junior Zi Ling&rsquo;s identities. Pardon me for my earlier offense.&rdquo;<br>The Godwish Grandmother and<br>Lady of Dao Sea bowed apologetically to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Elders, please call me Chu Feng. I might be a disciple of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, but I&rsquo;m not Lord Sectmaster&rsquo;s disciple,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>He already viewed both the Godwish Grandmother and<br>Lady of Dao Sea as elders, so it was weirdly uncomfortable to have them address him as &lsquo;junior&rsquo;.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go with that then. Chu Feng, where are we heading to now?&rdquo;<br>Lady of Dao Sea asked.<br>They were now Chu Feng&rsquo;s guards, so they would follow Chu Feng wherever he wanted to go.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure where we should head to now, but there&rsquo;s an urgent matter I need to attend to right now. May I ask if you are acquainted with Master Yin Ren?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>He was asking that because he had no idea where Master Yin Ren was at the moment. Considering the Godwish Grandmother and<br>Lady of Dao Sea&rsquo;s lofty standing in the Nine Souls Sacred Galaxy, it was likely that they would have a huge network of connections to tap into.<br>They might just be able to find Master Yin Ren.<br>&ldquo;Yin Ren? You&rsquo;re referring to the one who joined the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, right?&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother asked.<br>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;It would be a gross understatement to claim that we are acquainted,&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother said with a meaningful tone. She then followed up with a question, &ldquo;Do you have a grudge against Yin Ren?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We do have a grudge between us.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng shared the grudge he had with Master Yin Ren and the Nine Souls Sacred Clan with the Godwish Grandmother and<br>Lady of Dao Sea. He didn&rsquo;t know what their relationship with Master Yin Ren was like, but he was confident that they would help him deal with Master Yin Ren given how loyal they were to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;In other words, you&rsquo;re looking for Yin Ren right now?&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother asked.<br>&ldquo;Yes. Elder, do you know where I could find him?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I do know of a person who might be able to find him,&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother replied.<br></p></div>
