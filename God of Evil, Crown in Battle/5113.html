        <h1>Chapter 5112</h1>
        <div>: Unexpected Problem<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo;<br>The Asura King obeyed Chu Feng&rsquo;s command.<br>Surprisingly, the red aura no longer returned. A moment later, the energy sealing off the Darknight Sacred River vanished. Everyone could sense that the Darknight Sacred River had opened up once again.<br>The crowd was now able to enter the Darknight Sacred River.<br>&ldquo;Waa, it&rsquo;s a success! Brother Chu Feng, you defeated the red monster in the Darknight Sacred River! You&rsquo;re amazing!&rdquo; Kong Tianhui cheered from the crowd.<br>With him starting the precedent, the rest of the crowd began cheering too. They thought that Chu Feng had defeated the energy sealing off the Darknight Sacred River.<br>Seeing that, Kong Tianhui thumped his chest and said, &ldquo;Everyone, that&rsquo;s my brother over there! That&rsquo;s my brother over there! That incredible godlike person up there is Kong Tianhui&rsquo;s brother!&rdquo;<br>The loud cheering drowned out his voice, such that only a few people near him could hear his words. Even so, Kong Tianhui still continued bragging tirelessly with a proud look on his face.<br>However, Chu Feng stared at the Darknight Sacred River with a frown. He sensed that something was amiss.<br>First and foremost, he noticed that even though the energy sealing off the Darknight Sacred River was similar to the river&rsquo;s aura, there were some discrepancies between them. Furthermore, he thought that it was weird for the red aura to suddenly stop its offense at this point judging by its ongoing momentum.<br>So, he examined the Darknight Sacred River vigilantly, but the river appeared to be truly unsealed. While he still harbored his doubts, it was indeed possible to enter the river now.<br>Chu Feng heaved a sigh of relief and turned to look at the crowd.<br>His gaze paused momentarily at Long Daozhi, the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master, Kong Tianci, Kong Ci, Xia Yun&rsquo;er, Li Ruochu, Li Yue&rsquo;er, and the others, and there was a faint smile on his face. After all, these were all his good friends who had once fought alongside him.<br>He had always treasured all of his friends. Even though there was a huge gap in their cultivation now, the places they had in his heart would never change.<br>Those people also sensed Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze, and from his smile, they could tell that Chu Feng still regarded them the same despite the vast change in his cultivation and standing. Delighted smiles soon appeared on their faces too, especially for Tantai Xin&rsquo;er. The radiant smile on her face showed her immense joy.<br>After all, Chu Feng was as good as an almighty god to them now. They were honored and excited to know that Chu Feng still remembered them after achieving unparalleled glory.<br>However, Chu Feng felt a little bitter upon seeing Tantai Xing&rsquo;er. He still remembered how the Tantai Heavenly Clan nearly went extinct due to the emergence of the Black-feathered Specter. Even though the ones that remained were all the elites, the Tantai Heavenly Clan was indeed much smaller than what it used to be.<br>Thinking about the Black-feathered Specter reminded him of Bai Liluo, who had a curse placed on her by the Black-feathered Specter.<br>If possible, he wanted to dispel Bai Liluo&rsquo;s curse, but the latter had been in closed-door training in the Chu Heavenly Clan. The mysterious man had kidnapped her along with the Chu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>It frustrated him when he thought about how the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were still missing to this day. He had made great advancements in his cultivation, but there were still many things in this world that he couldn&rsquo;t control.<br>&ldquo;Paying&hellip; paying respects to Lord Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>While Chu Feng was deep in thought, one of the elders of the Holy Light Clan suddenly approached him. It was a familiar face, but he couldn&rsquo;t remember his name. Nevertheless, he could tell from the other party&rsquo;s nervous expression that he had something to say.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Putong!<br>The elder kneeled down in front of Chu Feng and cried out, &ldquo;L-lord Chu Feng, I-I-I&hellip;&rdquo;<br>He was so nervous that he couldn&rsquo;t even speak coherently.<br>&ldquo;Calm down and speak your mind,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>The elder took a deep breath and was just about to speak once more when Shengguang Baimei came over.<br>&ldquo;What the hell are you stuttering for? You&rsquo;re disgracing our Holy Light Clan here!&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei bellowed.<br>That made the elder even more nervous, to the point that his body started shuddering like a terrified rabbit. However, Chu Feng kindly released a surge of his spirit power to calm the elder&rsquo;s emotions.<br>&ldquo;You can speak now, right?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Lord Chu Feng, it was under the orders of Lord Shengguang Xuanye that we came to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. Lord Xuanye feels deeply remorseful over what he has done, and he wishes to make up to you through this. This is an item that Lord Shengguang Xuanye has tasked me to hand over to you. I was afraid that I would never get a chance to meet Lord Chu Feng ever again, so I could only insolently request for an audience here.<br>&ldquo;Please punish me harshly if I&rsquo;m being audacious here!&rdquo;<br>The elder lowered his head and raised a Cosmos Sack in his hands.<br>&ldquo;Shengguang Xuanye? It looks like the Revolution Prison isn&rsquo;t as terrifying as I thought it out to be. Otherwise, how could he possibly still be able to issue orders to you? I can also see that the lot of you are also fiercely loyal to him,&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered.<br>Chu Feng was still unable to forgive Shengguang Xuanye.<br>The elder of the Holy Light Clan trembled in fear upon hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words.<br>&ldquo;Tell me. How was Shengguang Xuanye able to issue an order to you?&rdquo; Shengguang Xuanye bellowed.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Buyu suddenly flitted over to Chu Feng&rsquo;s side.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something I have been wanting to talk to you about, but I don&rsquo;t know how I should approach the matter,&rdquo; Shengguang Buyu said with a troubled look on his face.<br>&ldquo;Elder, is this related to Shengguang Xuanye? Did the Holy Monarch spare Shengguang Xuanye&rsquo;s life after emerging from his closed-door training?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Shengguang Xuanye had been ruling the Holy Light Clan for many years, and he had built up a loyal following during this period of time. That could be seen as much from the pained looks on the Holy Light Clansmen&rsquo;s faces when Shengguang Xuanye was sentenced that day.<br>For that reason, Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t be too surprised if the Holy Monarch had reinstated Shengguang Xuanye as the Holy Light Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. It was just that the matter was incredibly displeasing to him.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not it. Our Holy Monarch only came out of his closed-door training for a brief moment, so we didn&rsquo;t manage to report such minor matters to him,&rdquo; Shengguang Buyu said.<br>&ldquo;Elder Buyu, were you the one who released Shengguang Xuanye then?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Of course not. Why would I possibly spare Shengguang Xuanye? It&rsquo;s just that&hellip; Shengguang Xuanye has been the Holy Light Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief for many years, and he has a deep understanding of how the Holy Light Clan works. He also has a following that&rsquo;s fiercely loyal to him&hellip; He has escaped from the Revolution Prison,&rdquo; Shengguang Buyu said.<br></p></div>
