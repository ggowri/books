        <div> - Igniting The Fury Of The Crowd<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>At that moment, everyone cast their gazes to Liu Xiaoli and the others.<br>While those who arrived later were fine, the crowd present from earlier; the crowd that had laughed at Liu Xiaoli, had all turned ashen. They all felt lingering fear in their heart.<br>This was especially true for that member of Hero City who had rejected Liu Xiaoli and the others and even spoke to insult them. Even though he possessed a strong cultivation, his complexion still turned pale. Beads of sweat were falling from his forehead nonstop. Even the hand that he was wiping his sweat with was shivering.<br>As they were disrespectful toward Chu Feng&rsquo;s friends earlier, they knew they had made an enormous mistake.<br>Fear. They were all afraid that Chu Feng would attack them.<br>What they feared even more was that no one would act to stop Chu Feng if he were to attack them.<br>Even if he were to kill them, no one would say that Chu Feng was in the wrong.<br>Thus, at that moment, they all felt as if there was a blade right on their necks. It was the sensation that they could die at any time.<br>However, Chu Feng did not do anything to them.<br>Instead, he walked over to Liu Xiaoli and the others. With an apologetic expression, he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I have made you all suffer because I came out late.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what sort of words are those? I am already very satisfied to be able to see you again,&rdquo; Liu Xiaoli said with a joyous expression on her face.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, are you really planning to refuse the World Spiritist Saintess&rsquo;s offer of reconciliation for us? That was a lot of treasures.&rdquo;<br>Before Liu Xiaoli could say anything, those Red Butterfly Society&rsquo;s elders spoke with distressed expressions on their faces.<br>To them, suffering some minor humiliation was nothing serious. Yet, what the World Spiritist Saintess offered to Chu Feng was a great amount of treasures. Especially the renowned Dual Hatred, the two of them were things that they felt they would never be able to obtain in their lifetime.<br>As Chu Feng had actually renounced those treasures because of them, they felt extremely guilty.<br>&ldquo;Are treasures more important than friendship?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a smile.<br>At that moment, the people from the Red Butterfly Society were all startled.<br>Even the bystanders present were startled.<br>Friendship?<br>In the world of martial cultivators, was friendship important?<br>It was. For certain people, friendship was enormously important. However, in the end, there would still be a limit to one&rsquo;s friendship.<br>Thus, even if friendship was important, it would not be the most important thing. What was most important would be one&rsquo;s strength, one&rsquo;s cultivation.<br>Thus, in the world of martial cultivators, many people would seek friendship for the sake of self interest.<br>In fact, even those of the same family; kin related by blood, would kill one another for the sake of their own benefits.<br>Yet, Chu Feng was actually able to remain unwavering even when faced with treasures like the Dual Hatred.<br>From this, one could tell how important friendship was in his heart. It had most likely reached an invaluable degree.<br>The crowd present felt admiration and even astonishment for Chu Feng.<br>The reason for that was because this was something that they could not accomplish.<br>&ldquo;Lord Chu Feng, my apologies, I am truly sorry.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I had no idea that these people were your friends. If I had known&hellip; I would never have dared to reject them.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, the Hero City member that had rejected Liu Xiaoli and the others ran over with an eagerly attentive expression on his face.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually Lord Xu Lian.&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing the middle-aged man, many people gasped in surprise.<br>As this Hero City member was capable of holding the authority to accept or reject those wanting to become allies to Hero City, he would naturally not be an ordinary individual.<br>That said, that person by the name of Xu Lian was also a famous character in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>He possessed a cultivation of peak Martial Ancestor, and was one of the more outstanding non-associated cultivators in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>&ldquo;Paa~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng slapped with his hand. That slap accurately landed onto that Xu Lian&rsquo;s face.<br>The surrounding crowd were all struck speechless by that scene. Even Liu Xiaoli and the others were deeply shocked.<br>That person was not an ordinary member of Hero City. He was Xu Lian!<br>If Chu Feng were to attack them, they would have no say about it. However, Chu Feng actually slapped Xu Lian like that. They were truly shocked by it.<br>&ldquo;Lord Chu Feng, you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Xu Lian was also stunned. He was at a complete loss as to what had just happened.<br>&ldquo;It is your business as to whether you agree to have them join Hero City. I have no say in that matter.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However&hellip; you spoke to insult my friends. Thus, I cannot watch with folded arms. That slap was only a warning. If there&rsquo;s a next time, I will cut out your tongue,&rdquo; Chu Feng spoke coldly.<br>It was only after hearing those words that Xu Lian knew why he was slapped. At that moment, he also became certain of how serious the matter was. Thus, he promptly apologized, &ldquo;This lowly one will never dare to do it again, this lowly one will never dare to do it again.&rdquo;<br>While others might not know about it, that Xu Lian had been in Hero City for some time now. Thus, he knew very well how much importance Ying Mingchao placed on Chu Feng.<br>Furthermore, he had obtained news from others that Chu Feng would become Hero City&rsquo;s Vice City Master.<br>If Ying Mingchao was the number one individual that one could not offend in Hero City, then Chu Feng would definitely be the number two individual that one could not offend.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, why did you hit my elder brother, what makes you think that you can hit him?&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a woman rushed out from the crowd. She pointed at Chu Feng like a vixen.<br>Although that woman was young and beautiful, she was emitting a sharp and hostile aura all over.<br>Her cultivation was not weak; she was a rank eight Martial Ancestor. As for her age, she was over a thousand years old.<br>Not only was she a member of Hero City, but she was also that Xu Lian&rsquo;s younger blood sister.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak nonsense!&rdquo;<br>Seeing this, Xu Lian hurriedly shouted down his sister.<br>Although Xu Lian also felt displeased to be slapped in public, he decided to swallow his anger after considering Chu Feng&rsquo;s identity and status.<br>As for his younger sister, she had always been a crafty and unruly tyrant. Only she was allowed to bully others, and not the other way around.<br>Today, he had been publicly slapped. His younger sister would most definitely not be able to tolerate that. As such, he was extremely scared that his younger sister would do something that she should not, and court unnecessary trouble.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, did you know that this Chu Feng is simply not a member of Hero City? What makes him think that he can hit you?&rdquo; Xu Lian&rsquo;s younger sister said.<br>&ldquo;What? Chu Feng is not a part of Hero City?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the surrounding crowd were all shocked. They had all heard that Chu Feng had joined Hero City long ago.<br>&ldquo;What sort of nonsense are you spouting?!&rdquo; Xu Lian loudly shouted his younger sister down. He even revealed a slightly angry expression.<br>The reason for that was because he felt Chu Feng to be the person that would become Hero City&rsquo;s Vice City Master. As such, how could Chu Feng not be a part of Hero City?<br>He felt that his younger sister was simply crazy to say something like that.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not spouting nonsense. If you don&rsquo;t believe me, go and ask around. Go and ask Chu Feng, ask him if he&rsquo;s a part of Hero City,&rdquo; Xu Lian&rsquo;s younger sister pointed to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, I have indeed not joined Hero City. I have not joined it before, and will not join it after,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng actually really did not join Hero City?&rdquo;<br>Once Chu Feng said those words, the crowd immediately burst into an uproar. This was most definitely immensely serious news.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; you don&rsquo;t plan to join Hero City?&rdquo; Hearing what Chu Feng said, Xu Lian&rsquo;s expression changed.<br>If Chu Feng did not plan to join Hero City, he would not be able to become the Vice City Master. Furthermore, for someone not a part of Hero City to have the audacity to publicly slap a person from Hero City, that was most definitely an unforgivable action.<br>To others, they felt that, to Hero City, this was most definitely something punishable with death.<br>Even if that person was Chu Feng, it would still be an action that Hero City would not tolerate.<br>The reason for that was because Hero City was a power that cared deeply for brotherly affection.<br>All of the members of Hero City were brothers with one another. Even in the rules of Hero City, it explicitly stated that those that dared to humiliate a brother of their city, regardless of the reason, would be killed with no exception!!!<br>&ldquo;Was what I said earlier not clear enough for you?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, why did you hit me?&rdquo; Xu Lian&rsquo;s attitude changed. It turned to one of anger.<br>The reason for that was because he came to find out that Chu Feng was not a part of Hero City. Thus, he grew confident.<br>After all, according to the rules of Hero City, as Chu Feng had slapped him earlier, Chu Feng had become an enemy of Hero City.<br>&ldquo;Because you insulted my friends,&rdquo; Chu Feng said disapprovingly.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you are truly an intolerable bully!&rdquo;<br>Xu Lian&rsquo;s complexion grew completely gloomy. As he spoke, he unleashed his boundless rank nine Martial Ancestor aura. His aura enveloped the entire region.<br>At that moment, everyone&rsquo;s nerves tightened. Could it be that Xu Lian planned to attack Chu Feng?<br>But, would he be able to win against Chu Feng?<br>Although they were all peak Martial Ancestors, Chu Feng&rsquo;s battle power was absolutely not something that Xu Lian could compare with.<br>&ldquo;Brothers of our Hero City, you all see this? This Chu Feng is not a member of our Hero City. Yet, he attacked me for no reason! Furthermore, his attitude was exceptionally vile!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not only is he not putting me, Xu Lian, in his eyes, but he is not putting our entire Hero City in his eyes!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brothers, can we possibly tolerate something like this?!&rdquo; Xu Lian shouted loudly.<br>It turned out that he didn&rsquo;t plan to fight against Chu Feng alone. Rather, he was planning to ignite the fury of the crowd and borrow the strength of all of Hero City to attack Chu Feng.<br><br></p></div>
