        <h1>Chapter 5602: We Recognize That Person</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we going to head to the Nine Realms Immortal Region first?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that Long Xiaoxiao is still waiting on the spot for me. If Elder Chaotic Era Scholar opened the Nine Realms Immortal Region for my sake, I won&rsquo;t miss the fortuitous encounter even if I get delayed a little. I don&rsquo;t want my friend to miss this opportunity because of me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Eggy replied with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn&rsquo;t want Chu Feng to miss this opportunity, but she unconditionally supported his decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many figures flitted across Chu Feng along the way; they were all heading to the Nine Realms Immortal Region. Excited faces could be seen around. Some failed to rein in their enthusiasm and screamed. Some teared up at the rare opportunity of being able to witness the legendary Immortal Stream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It could be seen how highly regarded the Nine Realms Immortal Region was to those from the Immortal Stream Upper Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng finally arrived at his destination. He reported his identity, and soon, he found himself standing before Long Xiaoxiao and her master, Ningyu Shangren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ningyu Shangren was as unfathomable as before; Chu Feng was still unable to see through her cultivation despite the advancements in his cultivation and spirit power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng is growing at an incredible pace. It has only been days since we last met, but you have already reached rank three Half-God level,&rdquo; Ningyu Shangren complimented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, you&rsquo;re flattering me. It has been more than days,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I might have exaggerated the time, but it makes your accomplishment no less shocking. Young friend Chu Feng, I heard that you became good friends with the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Long Chengyu and Long Muxi? It looks like your charisma matches your strength too. You&rsquo;re bound to achieve huge things in the future,&rdquo; Ningyu Shangren said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those from the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect were taken aback to hear those words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder sure is well-connected. I didn&rsquo;t expect you to know about that,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He figured that the news about the Immemorial Star Sea couldn&rsquo;t have spread that quickly, so Ningyu Shangren had to be referring to the events that had transpired on Painter Mountain. Nevertheless, those from the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect still looked at Chu Feng with bizarre eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng! You sure know how to put on airs!&rdquo; Qin Hang roared as he marched over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Senior Qin Hang,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao quickly stepped forward to stop Qin Hang, worried that the latter would make a move on Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Qin Hang pointed to the phenomenon in the distance and asked, &ldquo;Do you know what that is?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I heard about it along the way. That&rsquo;s likely to be the legendary Nine Realms Immortal Region,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good that you know. It&rsquo;s a legendary cultivation ground that can be traced back to </span><span>the earlier years of our current era. This is a fortuitous encounter that no one wants to miss, so most major powerhouses made their way over right away as soon as they saw it. However, Junior Xiaoxiao insisted on waiting here for you. Can you bear the responsibility if she misses this opportunity because of you?&rdquo; Qin Hang shouted angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Young master Qin Hang, why are you so agitated when Xiaoxiao hasn&rsquo;t said anything? If you are worried about missing this opportunity, you should have headed there first,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care whether I miss this opportunity or not, but I can&rsquo;t stand Xiaoxiao missing this opportunity because of you!&rdquo; Qin Hang exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng was initially displeased by Qin Hang&rsquo;s attitude, but he could see that the latter was acting in such a manner for Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s sake, so he decided not to argue with him. Thus, he said, &ldquo;Do you know which direction I came from?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Qin Hang fell silent upon hearing those words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd knew what Chu Feng was driving at. He was initially closer to the Nine Realms Immortal Region, and he definitely knew that there was a fortuitous encounter there, but he chose to head over here instead of rushing to the Nine Realms Immortal Region.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, he had done so because he was worried that Long Xiaoxiao was waiting for him. There was no way he could have known for sure that Long Xiaoxiao would insist on waiting for him, so there was a chance that he might have made a wasted trip, but he still chose to head over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s decision to wait for Chu Feng was touching, but so was Chu Feng&rsquo;s decision to head over to look for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Qin Hang&rsquo;s anger extinguished as if someone had poured a pail of cold water over him, but it made him feel uncomfortable instead. He could tell that Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s feelings weren&rsquo;t just one-sided and that the two of them truly cared for each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In particular, he noticed the joyful smile on Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s face despite her best attempt to conceal it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made him feel sour inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make a move,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng, Long Xiaoxiao, Qin Hang, and the experts from the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect made their way to the Nine Realms Immortal Region. Unless there were other hidden experts in the Immortal Stream Upper Stream, Chu Feng&rsquo;s group was indubitably the strongest one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn&rsquo;t take long for the group to arrive in the Nine Realms Immortal Region&rsquo;s vicinity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at it close-up, the phenomenon reflecting the vast world of cultivation was so huge that it covered the sky. Even those who had weathered plenty of storms found their souls shaking at such a majestic sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the first thing that caught the crowd&rsquo;s attention was still the Nine Realms Immortal Region itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Nine Realms Immortal Region floated in the sky as a massive sphere, glowing with brilliant starlight. There were eight spirit formation gates towering more than ten </span><span>thousand meters in height on the sphere, and they glowed with incredible brilliance. They looked majestic, drawing a clear difference between them and ordinary spirit formation gates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of the eight spirit formation gates was labeled with the name of a galaxy, namely Ancestral Martial, Nine Souls, Seven Realms, Bloodline, Heavenly Dome, Divine Body, Immortal Sea, and Totem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng could see a steady stream of people entering the spirit formation gates, and they were all juniors. Most headed for the entrance labeled Heavenly Dome, but there was still a small portion of people entering the other entrances, including the one labeled Nine Souls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were also many experts lingering outside the entrances, waiting with bated breaths for the outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, there was one exception&mdash;the entrance labeled Ancestral Martial. Not a single junior entered that entrance, and there was hardly anyone lingering outside it. It was pitiful compared to the other entrances, especially the Heavenly Dome entrance, which was filled to the brim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some juniors had tried to enter the Ancestral Martial entrance, but they couldn&rsquo;t enter it at all because they weren&rsquo;t from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. They had only wanted to see if the Nine Realms Immortal Region was really that amazing as to be able to differentiate one&rsquo;s origin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As it turned out, the Nine Realms Immortal Region was truly that amazing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;The Ancestral Martial entrance was doomed to remain closed, but things are different now that Junior Xiaoxiao is here. If there&rsquo;s anyone else from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy here, I can only say that they are truly lucky.&rdquo; Qin Hang thoroughly complimented Long Xiaoxiao before saying, &ldquo;Junior Xiaoxiao, I&rsquo;ll see you inside.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Qin Hang then anxiously flew toward the Heavenly Dome entrance. He wanted to make his name by earning the glory of being the one to open the Heavenly Dome entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, let&rsquo;s go together,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao told Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them made their way to the Ancestral Martial entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Why is there even the Ancestral Martial entrance? I think the Nine Realms Immortal Region is struggling to keep up with the times. The current Ancestral Martial Galaxy is not the same as what it used to be. It should have just remained closed.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Right? Is there even anyone in that backward place? I reckon that those living there are trash worse than cockroaches, or else who will even stay in that backward place?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quite a few people outside the Ancestral Martial entrance were mocking the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s eyes turned cold, but Chu Feng stopped her with a shake of his head. He knew better than to waste his time with those who only knew how to run their mouths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I advise you to shut your mouth. The Ancestral Martial Galaxy isn&rsquo;t as weak as you make it out to be,&rdquo; a voice suddenly echoed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng and Long Xiaoxiao looked over, only to widen their eyes in surprise. They recognized the owner of the voice.</span></p></div>
