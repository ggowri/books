        <h1>Chapter 4208</h1>
        <div> - Chu Feng&rsquo;s Arrival<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;All-seeing Heavenly Master, you have a brilliant name in the Holy Light Galaxy. You are someone who is revered by hundreds of millions of people. How could you be this despicable and contemptible?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How could you do something so devoid of conscience for the sake of minor benefits?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t those two grandmasters close friends of yours, people that have known you for many years?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How could you murder them?&rdquo;<br>Long Shengbu was unable to contain himself and began to curse the All-seeing Heavenly Master.<br>&ldquo;Humph&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t your Dragon Clan have an even more brilliant reputation than myself? Aren&rsquo;t you also massacring one another for the sake of your own benefits?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget, it is the people of your Dragon Clan that paid a great price for me to take your lives.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Martial cultivators are all people that only care about their own interests. How are you qualified to criticize my behavior?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, all of you will soon be killed by me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As losers, you are even less qualified to criticize the winner.&rdquo;<br>As the All-seeing Heavenly Master spoke, she sent her spirit formation to attack Long Xiaoxiao and the others.<br>Her spirit formation possessed overwhelming power. It was simply unstoppable.<br>Seeing the incoming attack, Long Xiaoxiao closed her eyes unwillingly.<br>She had made up her mind that she would most definitely be killed. Thus, she prepared herself for death.<br>However, even though the overwhelming killing intent had arrived, the terrifying spirit formation did not land on their bodies.<br>Not only did it not land, it instead began to roar with strange noises.<br>Confused, Long Xiaoxiao opened her eyes.<br>It was only then that she discovered that an even more terrifying spirit formation had appeared before them.<br>The spirit formation that had appeared greatly resembled the power of the All-seeing Heavenly Master&rsquo;s spirit formation. It was also filled with terrifying dark black gaseous flames.<br>That spirit formation was not only mighty, it was also terrifying and tyrannical!<br>The only difference between the two spirit formations was that the one that had blocked the All-seeing Heavenly Master&rsquo;s spirit formation was even more powerful than hers.<br>But, why would such a spirit formation appear for no reason? Furthermore, why would it block the All-seeing Heavenly Master&rsquo;s attack?<br>Right when the crowd were confused, a voice was heard.<br>&ldquo;Senior Long, this treasure of yours blocked my path,&rdquo; that voice came from within the giant golden bell.<br>Right after that voice was heard, the giant golden bell was sent flying by an enormous power.<br>When the giant golden bell flew away, the terrifying dark black spirit formation gate reappeared.<br>In addition to that, a figure also appeared before the crowd.<br>That person was none other than Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng?!&rdquo;<br>Without exception, the crowd were all surprised to see Chu Feng.<br>They had never imagined that Chu Feng would suddenly appear there.<br>&ldquo;You did that?&rdquo; The All-seeing Heavenly Master spoke.<br>She didn&rsquo;t know Chu Feng. It was their first encounter.<br>She was able to sense that the enormously powerful spirit formation that had blocked her attack had come from him.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng did that?&rdquo;<br>It was only after hearing the All-seeing Heavenly Master's words that Long Xiaoxiao and others managed to react to what had happened.<br>However, they felt even greater disbelief.<br>Although they were very shocked to see Chu Feng, they did not associate the power that had blocked the All-seeing Heavenly Master&rsquo;s attack with him.<br>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re the renowned All-seeing Heavenly Master.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that you&rsquo;re proficient in making prophecies, and will oftentimes predict other people&rsquo;s futures.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In that case, have you ever prophesied your own future?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Did you know that you would be defeated here today?&rdquo;<br>With a beaming smile on his face, Chu Feng looked at the All-seeing Heavenly Master.<br>&ldquo;A mere brat wants to sabotage my business?&rdquo;<br>A vicious look appeared in the All-seeing Heavenly Master&rsquo;s eyes. She then opened her arms and pushed them toward Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Roar---&rdquo;<br>An even more powerful spirit formation was released from her body.<br>That spirit formation did not have a concrete form. Yet, one could sense that it was extremely terrifying and overwhelmingly powerful. Like a massive wave capable of obliterating everything before it, the spirit formation charged toward Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Buzz---&rdquo;<br>However, before that spirit formation could even reach Chu Feng, it suddenly stopped.<br>As if it was petrified, the spirit formation froze in midair.<br>This time around, Chu Feng did not release a spirit formation to block the All-seeing Heavenly Master&rsquo;s attack.<br>Because of that, Long Xiaoxiao and the others had thought that the All-seeing Heavenly Master had stopped her own attack.<br>However, the frozen spirit formation began moving shortly after.<br>However, after it began moving, it did not continue toward Chu Feng.<br>Instead, it turned around and began moving toward the All-seeing Heavenly Master.<br>Seeing that things were amiss, the All-seeing Heavenly Master immediately severed her connection with the spirit formation and flew away. Only then did she dodge the attack.<br>&ldquo;How could this be?!&rdquo;<br>Seeing this scene, Long Xiaoxiao and the others became even more confused.<br>Why would the All-seeing Heavenly Master&rsquo;s spirit formation turn to attack her?<br>This was simply unreasonable!<br>Confused, they looked at Chu Feng and the All-seeing Heavenly Master.<br>It was only then that they realized the All-seeing Heavenly Master had a look of panic on her face. She was no longer calm and composed like before.<br>As for Chu Feng, he was completely unperturbed. Most importantly, confidence filled his face.<br>That sort of confidence was the confidence of someone that had devised a battle plan in advance, and had grasped victory in hand.<br>Could it be that it had been done by Chu Feng?<br>Right when this thought crossed Long Xiaoxiao and the others&rsquo; minds, the All-seeing Heavenly Master suddenly spoke.<br>&ldquo;Exactly who are you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve actually controlled this remnant&rsquo;s powers.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, what is that spirit formation gate behind you?&rdquo; the All-seeing Heavenly Master asked with a stern voice.<br>Earlier, she had been looking down on Chu Feng. But with the situation as it was, she had begun to fear him.<br>She had clearly grasped control over the power of this remnant&rsquo;s spirit formation.<br>But, after Chu Feng appeared, the remnant&rsquo;s spirit formation was no longer under her control. Instead, it was being controlled by Chu Feng.<br>She realized that Chu Feng had greater control over the remnant&rsquo;s spirit formation.<br>She had lost control over the remnant&rsquo;s spirit formation.<br>Chu Feng revealed a faint smile toward the All-seeing Heavenly Master&rsquo;s questions, &ldquo;In the world of martial cultivators, the victor is king and the loser is a bandit.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;A loser is not qualified to ask all those questions.&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he looked to the slaughtering formation above Long Shengbu.<br>&ldquo;Buzz---&rdquo;<br>With merely a look, the slaughtering formation suppressing Long Shengbu began to move away. Soon, it arrived above the All-seeing Heavenly Master.<br>Furthermore, the grand slaughtering formation that had been set up by the All-seeing Heavenly Master began attacking her.<br>The All-seeing Heavenly Master&rsquo;s cultivation was clearly inferior to Long Shengbu&rsquo;s.<br>Even though she also managed to withstand the slaughtering formation&rsquo;s attacks, she had fallen on one knee, and her facial expression was completely distorted. She was having a very difficult time withstanding it.<br>&ldquo;Princess Xiaoxiao, Senior Long, this person here tried to kill you all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As such, I&rsquo;ll leave her in your hands,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, thanks a lot.&rdquo;<br>Long Shengbu clasped his fist at Chu Feng. Then, he planned to attack the All-seeing Heavenly Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Bang---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the All-seeing Heavenly Exalted exploded.<br>There was no prior indication for her sudden explosion.<br>Seeing that, Chu Feng narrowed his brows.<br>He knew that the All-seeing Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s explosion had not been caused by the spirit formation.<br>Rather, she had exploded herself.<br>In the next moment, the All-seeing Heavenly Master&rsquo;s voice echoed in the main hall, &ldquo;So your name is Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remember you. Sooner or later, I&rsquo;ll settle this debt with you.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng immediately used the power of the spirit formation to search for the All-seeing Heavenly Exalted in the remnant. However, he wasn't able to find her.<br></p></div>
