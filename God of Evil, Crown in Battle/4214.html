        <div> - Offer You An Opportunity<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Beast Tamer, you can rest assured. I, Tang Chen, will definitely not break my promise.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, I&rsquo;ve lost. I, Tang Chen, am capable of accepting loss with grace.&rdquo;<br>As Grandmaster Tang Chen spoke, he took out a map from his Cosmos Sack.<br>The map was yellow in color, and appeared to have been made of sheepskin. The map emitted a strong ancient aura, and was damaged.<br>When he saw the map, Yuan Shu immediately felt his heart grow tense.<br>At the same time, the shame and guilt he felt reached a peak.<br>He had not expected his master to actually use the Incomplete Map of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain as a gambling stake against the Revered Master Beast Tamer.<br>He had no idea about their gamble.<br>But, even if he had known about it, what could he possibly do?<br>With his opponent coming to his door, how could he avoid the fight?<br>In the end, it was because his skills were inferior.<br>When he thought of this, the guilt that Yuan Shu felt grew even more intense.<br>&ldquo;That incomplete map!&rdquo;<br>What Yuan Shu and the others didn&rsquo;t know was that Chu Feng had a look of surprise when he saw the incomplete map.<br>He had not only obtained the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk from the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted; he had also obtained some other treasures.<br>Among them were five incomplete maps that emitted an Ancient Era&rsquo;s aura.<br>Those incomplete maps were identical to the one that Grandmaster Tang Chen took out.<br>Furthermore, from the reaction of Grandmaster Tang Chen and Revered Master Beast Tamer, Chu Feng could tell that those incomplete maps seemed to possess an extraordinary origin.<br>&ldquo;Woosh---&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen waved his arm and tossed the Incomplete Map of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain to Revered Master Beast Tamer.<br>He caught the incomplete map and beamed with happiness. His smile was so large that the corners of his mouth were about to reach behind his ears. He was truly overjoyed.<br>&ldquo;Tang Chen, among all of us, this old man had the least amount of Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain. I only have two.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But things are different now. I now have three in my possession.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If my memory serves me correctly, you had four in your possession. Now that you&rsquo;ve lost one to this old man, you should have three incomplete maps left, no?&rdquo; the Revered Master Beast Tamer asked with a beaming, complacent smile. That smile of his was truly disgusting.<br>&ldquo;What does the amount of incomplete maps I have matter to you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The gamble we made staked only a single incomplete map,&rdquo; Grandmaster Tang Chen said with a stern voice.<br>&ldquo;Of course I know that. It&rsquo;s just&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hehe&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How about, we make another gamble?&rdquo; Revered Master Beast Tamer proposed with a grin.<br>&ldquo;Who would&rsquo;ve thought that you&rsquo;re actually this courageous?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are you planning to compete with martial power or world spirit techniques?&rdquo; asked Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>He even took a step toward Revered Master Beast Tamer as he spoke.<br>&ldquo;No, no, no&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Revered Master Beast Tamer immediately shook his head and waved his hand repeatedly as he backed away from Grandmaster Tang Chen..<br>It could be seen that he was afraid of him.<br>&ldquo;Brother Tang Chen, don&rsquo;t think I don&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;ve already reached Martial Exalted. I&rsquo;m still only a peak Utmost Exalted. If we are to compete in martial power, how could I possibly be a match for you?&rdquo; Revered Master Beast Tamer said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;I can do world spirit techniques too,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;We can forget about world spirit techniques too. If we are to compete with that, it&rsquo;ll go on with no end.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we have our disciples compete again?&rdquo; Revered Master Beast Tamer asked with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;Are you doing this on purpose?&rdquo; Grandmaster Tang Chen revealed his displeasure.<br>Their disciples had already sparred earlier. His disciple Yuan Shu had already lost.<br>For Revered Master Beast Tamer to request another match between their disciples now was simply an act of wanting to gain more benefit from a known outcome. That was simply too excessive.<br>&ldquo;Hehe, I&rsquo;m merely joking. Why take it so seriously?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Actually, this old man only came here with the intention of paying you a visit.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I only suddenly recalled the gamble we had made upon learning that your disciple had also grasped rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation. That&rsquo;s why I had them spar with one another.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I most definitely didn&rsquo;t come here for your incomplete map.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since I got to see you, I am content with my journey here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Judging from the time, it&rsquo;s about time for that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain to open. At that time, world spiritists from all over will be present. I&rsquo;ve heard that the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted has also exited his closed-door training ahead of time all for the sake of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I presume that brother Tang Chen will also be going there.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In that case, let us meet again at the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That being said, I must still thank brother Tang Chen.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, this incomplete map will be extremely useful inside the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain,&rdquo; Revered Master Beast Tamer said with a beaming smile.<br>After saying those words, he intended to leave.<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen had a look of displeasure clearly written on his face.<br>He knew very well that Revered Master Beast Tamer had come precisely for his incomplete map.<br>Now that he had won an incomplete map, he actually still dared to say such a thing. It had truly angered Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>The truth was that if Grandmaster Tang Chen wanted to act as a sore loser, Revered Master Beast Tamer would not be able to do anything about it.<br>After all, Grandmaster Tang Chen surpassed him in all aspects.<br>Unfortunately, although Grandmaster Tang Chen had a bad temper, he was someone who cared about his reputation a lot.<br>Besides, it was true that Yuan Shu had been defeated thoroughly in the sparring match.<br>As such, he could not go back on his promise.<br>&ldquo;Wait.&rdquo;<br>Right when Revered Master Beast Tamer and his disciple Li Fengxue were leaving, Chu Feng suddenly called out to them.<br>&ldquo;Are you speaking to me?&rdquo;<br>Revered Master Beast Tamer immediately narrowed his brows slightly after being called out by Chu Feng.<br>He had a look of great displeasure as he looked at him. He felt that someone like Chu Feng simply wasn't qualified to speak to him.<br>&ldquo;Senior, you seem to be very interested in this Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain&rsquo;s incomplete map.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he took out an incomplete map from his Cosmos Sack.<br>Seeing the map, Revered Master Beast Tamer&rsquo;s eyes started shining.<br>Even Grandmaster Tang Chen, Yuan Shu and Li Fengxue were greatly surprised.<br>None of them had anticipated that Chu Feng would actually possess a treasure as precious as an Incomplete Map of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain.<br>&ldquo;Brat, why would you have an Incomplete Map of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain?&rdquo; Revered Master Beast Tamer asked with a stern voice.<br>He was excited. Even the tone of his voice had changed.<br>&ldquo;Senior doesn&rsquo;t have to worry about that. That said, if senior is truly interested in this incomplete map, this junior is willing to offer senior an opportunity,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Opportunity?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Revered Master Beast Tamer was completely confused. He didn&rsquo;t understand Chu Feng&rsquo;s intentions.<br></p></div>
