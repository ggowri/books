        <h1>Chapter 2545</h1>
        <div> - Her Highness Yu&rsquo;er<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, the space next to him started to tremble slightly. Then, a woman walked out.<br>Compared to the middle-aged man, this woman was much younger. Not only did she have an attractive face, but her figure was also enchanting. She was a sexy woman.<br>That said, although she had a very sexy appearance, she was wearing the same sort of majestic armor as the middle-aged man.<br><br>Furthermore, that woman also had the same identical &lsquo;Palace Guard&rsquo; title plate on her waist.<br>&ldquo;That boy is truly a toad that wants to eat swan meat,&rdquo; The woman looked to the direction that Xianhai Shuoyi had left in and smiled coldly. She added, &ldquo;He should have checked his status. If it wasn&rsquo;t for Her Highness Yu&rsquo;er having such a good personality, how could she concern herself with someone like him, the son of a servant?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother with him. After all&hellip; he&rsquo;s hopeless,&rdquo; The middle-aged man said.<br>&ldquo;Of course. With how excellent Her Highness Yu&rsquo;er is, how could she fancy someone like him? She is merely feeling pity for him,&rdquo; The woman said.<br><br>The two of them were conversing through voice transmissions. Thus, only the two of them were capable of hearing it.<br>On the island was an overhanging cliff.<br>The cliff was very dangerous. However, a young woman was sitting at the edge of the cliff.<br>She was sitting at the edge of the cliff with her legs dangling at an altitude of over ten thousand meters.<br>That young woman had a head full of beautiful jet black hair that sprinkled down behind her. As she blinked, her long eyelashes trembled slightly.<br>Her beautiful eyes were very clear. It was as if there were countless stars within them. They were completely untainted.<br>Her tall nose bridge and delicate cherry lips were also magnificently beautiful.<br>This young woman&rsquo;s appearance was simply the pinnacle of beauty. Especially her pure and charming aura, it was simply akin to that of a celestial fairy. She was simply perfect.<br>Not only was the young woman&rsquo;s facial appearance akin to that of a celestial fairy, but her figure was also very good. She possessed snow-white skin with a faint rosy and translucent glow. Her skin was like that of jade.<br>As for her long green dress, it made the woman appear like an elf in the world.<br>It was as if a woman like her could only be seen in one&rsquo;s dreams, and not present in reality.<br>&ldquo;Huu~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, wind blew past. Her long green skirt started to flutter slightly. The young woman&rsquo;s beautiful legs were exposed intermittently. It was truly alluring.<br>Likely, apart from Her Lady Queen, there was no one that could match that young woman&rsquo;s beauty.<br>Although that young woman was very beautiful, she had a child-like personality.<br>The young woman was swinging her legs back and forth over the cliff. As for her beautiful eyes, they were sizing up a beaded chain that she was fiddling with in her hand.<br>However, her witty appearance made her seem even more lovely.<br>&ldquo;Yu&rsquo;er, is that beaded chain what you&rsquo;ve obtained from the Sacred Heavenly Temple?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a voice was heard. It was Xianhai Shuoyi. He descended from the sky and stood behind that beautiful young woman, then slowly walked toward her.<br>Seeing Xianhai Shuoyi, the young woman did not show any sign of being on guard. Instead, she turned around, smiled sweetly and held up the beaded chain in her hand.<br>&ldquo;How is it? Not bad, no?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Xianhai Shuoyi was able to clearly see the beaded chain. The beaded chain was sparking, translucent and dark green in color. Each and every bead on the beaded chain seemed to be alive.<br><br>Not only that, but if one were to look carefully, one would see that the beads were actually all grand formations. There was a total of a hundred and thirty-eight beads. In other words, there were a hundred and thirty-eight grand formations. Each and every single grand formation was extremely powerful. Furthermore&hellip; there were both defensive and offensive formations.<br>&ldquo;The treasure one obtains after using a Martial Immortal-level Sacred Temple Bead to enter the Sacred Heavenly Temple is truly of excellent quality,&rdquo; Xianhai Shuoyi said.<br><br>&ldquo;Xianhai Shuoyi, what sort of treasure did you obtain? Let me have a look at it,&rdquo; The young woman&rsquo;s beautiful eyes were flickering in a very mischievous manner.<br>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Xianhai Shuoyi&rsquo;s expression turned sluggish. After a moment of hesitation, he said, &ldquo;Compared to your bracelet, what I&rsquo;ve obtained is simply unworthy of mention. Thus, I&rsquo;m not going to take it out to shame myself.&rdquo;<br>Xianhai Shuoyi did not tell the truth.<br>He was able to tell anyone that he had been defeated in the Sacred Heavenly Temple by someone and did not obtain any treasure. However, it was only before this young woman before him that he did not dare say that.<br>He was afraid that the young woman would be disappointed in him. He was also afraid that he would shame himself.<br>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want to tell me, so be it.&rdquo;<br>The young woman raised her head and turned around as she continued to fiddle with the beaded chain in her hand.<br>It seemed like she was not very concerned with what that Xianhai Shuoyi might have obtained.<br>Xianhai Shuoyi walked over to the young woman and said, &ldquo;Yu&rsquo;er, this bracelet of yours is very pretty. It suits you very well. Why don&rsquo;t you wear it?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;What bracelet? This is a footlace. Boys like you truly do not know about anything,&rdquo; The young woman let out a ridiculing laughter.<br>However, this ridiculing and mocking laughter was so very pleasant-sounding when it reached Xianhai Shuoyi&rsquo;s ears.<br>He did not feel that his ego was insulted from the young woman&rsquo;s ridiculing laughter. The reason for that was because he knew the young woman very well, and knew that she was not really ridiculing him. He knew that she was merely joking with him.<br>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s actually a footlace. Isn&rsquo;t that even better? You&rsquo;ll be able to replace that old, dirty footlace on your feet,&rdquo; Xianhai Shuoyi said.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right after Xianhai Shuoyi said those words, he suddenly felt that the surrounding air had instantly turned incomparably ice-cold.<br>Even though he was a grand True Immortal-level expert, he still felt bone-chilling coldness.<br>&ldquo;Yu&rsquo;er, are you angry?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Xianhai Shuoyi&rsquo;s voice was trembling slightly. Although the young woman did not explicitly express it, he knew that she was angry.<br>The bone-chilling coldness was caused by the young woman&rsquo;s change in mood.<br>The young woman slowly got up. However, she completely ignored Xianhai Shuoyi and walked past him. She began to walk toward the depths of the mountain.<br>Seeing that, Xianhai Shuoyi hesitated slightly. He wanted to say something, but didn&rsquo;t dare to say it.<br>Finally, he tightly clenched his fists, gathered up his courage and said, &ldquo;Yu&rsquo;er, wait a moment.&rdquo;<br>The young woman stopped. However, she did not turn around. Instead, with her back facing Xianhai Shuoyi, she said, &ldquo;What do you need now?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yu&rsquo;er, I have something that I&rsquo;ve wanted to ask you for a long time now. Exactly what did you experience back then? Why did you completely change after returning?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, you&rsquo;ve been wearing that footlace the entire time ever since. But, that footlace is merely an Elite Armament. It is simply useless in protecting you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why do you wear it all the time? Exactly what did you experience?&rdquo; Xianhai Shuoyi spoke in an emotional manner.<br>Evidently, he had kept those words in his heart for a very long time. Today, he was finally able to let them out.<br>&ldquo;You have given me footlaces many times in the past. Your goal is so that I will change this footlace, right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Did you do that because you felt that my footlace was very unbefitting of me?&rdquo; The young woman spoke calmly.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, I feel that footlace to be very ugly, very irksome. I do not wish to see you wearing it,&rdquo; Xianhai Shuoyi spoke emotionally.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br><br>Right at that moment, that Xianhai Shuoyi suddenly crashed onto the ground. Overwhelming power caused crushed rocks to scatter about in the air. Xianhai Shuoyi was crushed deep into the rocks of the cliff, unable to move in the slightest.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>At the very next instant, a total of twenty-four figures appeared on the cliff simultaneously. They completely surrounded the young woman.<br>Among those people, the youngest were middle-aged individuals, whereas the oldest were white-haired elderly individuals. The man and woman from earlier were also present among them.<br>Not only were they all wearing the same sort of armor, but they also all had the &lsquo;Palace Guard&rsquo; title plate on their waists.<br>Most importantly, those twenty-four individuals all possessed extremely frightening auras. Their cultivations were extremely powerful, and most definitely superior to those of Martial Immortals.<br>At that moment, they were looking at their surroundings in a greatly alerted manner. The killing intent from their eyes could be said to be extremely frightening.<br>It was as if their gazes and auras alone were sufficient to suffocate and kill their enemies.<br><br></p></div>
