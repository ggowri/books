        <div>: Really A Bit Hideous<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;How laughable! Do you think that we, of the Dao Sea, would listen to the words of an outsider? Even those of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan wouldn&rsquo;t be able to help you! You should just wait for your own death!&rdquo; the powerful disciple sneered with a look of disdain.<br>After hearing those words, Chu Feng also had no idea how he should speak up.<br>He had come here with a request for the Dao Sea, after all, and he wasn&rsquo;t on close terms with the Lady of Dao Sea either. Besides, he didn&rsquo;t think that he was close enough with the elder of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect to put himself on the line for him.<br>On the other hand, Elder Gongsun&rsquo;s face turned even paler.<br>In his view, the words of the powerful female disciple were as good as the verdict of the whole Dao Sea.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you know this man?&rdquo;<br>It was at this moment that the voice of the Lady of Dao Sea sounded from within the palace.<br>&ldquo;Elder, I am indeed acquainted with this elder,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied honestly.<br>Shoosh!<br>Right after those words were spoken, a shocking sight occurred.<br>The formation that had bound Elder Gongsun was suddenly released.<br>&ldquo;Let him go,&rdquo; the Lady of Dao Sea&rsquo;s voice sounded from within the palace.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Everyone could hardly believe what they were seeing.<br>Putting aside Elder Gongsun and Chu Feng, even the disciples of the Dao Sea were stunned by this abrupt move.<br>This wasn&rsquo;t the style of their master at all!<br>&ldquo;Master, you mustn&rsquo;t believe this man&rsquo;s words! How could he possibly not know about our Dao Sea? Besides, he came here to use the power of our Dao Sea to activate his treasure! He&rsquo;s clearly looking down on our Dao Sea to dare make such brazen actions. We can&rsquo;t let him off easily!&rdquo; the powerful disciple exclaimed.<br>&ldquo;I said, let him go,&rdquo; the Lady of Dao Sea spoke again.<br>This time, her voice wasn&rsquo;t as calm as before. It sounded a little impatient.<br>Sensing the change in the Lady of Dao Sea&rsquo;s mood, all of the disciples of the Lady of Dao Sea immediately paled in fright. Even the powerful disciple was intimidated too.<br>Even though they usually put on a cheery appearance, in truth, they carried some fear for their powerful master too.<br>&ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;<br>The powerful disciple quickly bowed deeply toward the palace before turning to Elder Gongsun to say, &ldquo;Did you hear my master&rsquo;s words?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Y-yes, I&rsquo;ve heard it. My deepest gratitude to Lady of Dao Sea and the fairies.&rdquo;<br>The delighted Elder Gongsun quickly bowed deeply to the palace as well before doing the same to the disciples around.<br>He thought that he was doomed this time around, but who could have thought that there was still a turnaround here. He couldn&rsquo;t help but feel like he was dreaming.<br>&ldquo;Since my master has decided to spare you, you should quickly leave!&rdquo;<br>However, the polite attitude of Elder Gongsun didn&rsquo;t appear to have changed the powerful disciple&rsquo;s view of him. Instead, the rage on her face grew even more apparent.<br>&ldquo;Yes, this old man will take his leave right now!&rdquo;<br>With cold sweat dripping down his back, Elder Gongsun began to take his leave. However, before he rose to the air, he hesitated for a moment before he turned to Chu Feng and bowed deeply.<br>&ldquo;As&hellip; No, it should be young friend Chu Feng. I&rsquo;ve taken what you have done for me today to heart, and I&rsquo;ll surely repay you in the future. If you have time in the future, please do drop by our Cloudsky Immortal Sect,&rdquo; Elder Gongsun spoke earnestly from his heart.<br>He was surprised when he heard that Chu Feng had saved Lian Xi and the others, but he didn&rsquo;t think that he would end up becoming indebted to Chu Feng himself too.<br>And not to mention, in a place like Dao Sea at that.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll surely drop by if an opportunity presents itself in the future.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng also meant his words too. After all, Yin Zhuanghong was in the Cloudsky Immortal Sect at the moment.<br>&ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;ll be looking forward to your visit. We&rsquo;ll meet again, young friend Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>Without waiting for Chu Feng&rsquo;s response, Elder Gongsun rose to the sky and left the area. In the blink of an eye, he had already disappeared from the area.<br>Nevertheless, Chu Feng still couldn&rsquo;t help but notice how flustered he was when he took his leave. This really filled him with many conflicting emotions on the inside.<br>He could still remember just how lofty this Elder Gongsun was to him that day in the Red-dress Holy Land. He was like a god to them back then, a being who governed everyone&rsquo;s life and death.<br>Yet, at another time in a different place, he suddenly became such a humble individual. It was as if he had been fallen from the clouds and turned into a mortal.<br>Why would this be?<br>The answer was simple. He was not the strongest one in this land anymore.<br>This was simply how the world of cultivators worked!<br>It was a place where power reigned mighty, regardless of time and place. It had always been the case in the past, and it would continue to be so in the future.<br>In truth, Chu Feng was also a little gleeful at the situation too. He didn&rsquo;t think that the Lady of Dao Sea would give him such face.<br>Back then, the elder had spoken on his behalf for Lian Xi to go easy on him, and today, the Lady of Dao Sea had spared the elder on his account.<br>With this, the debt he owed back then could be said to have been repaid.<br>&ldquo;Why are you all still gathered here? Go and cultivate!&rdquo; the voice of the Lady of Dao Sea sounded once more.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, we&rsquo;ll meet again!&rdquo;<br>Song Feifei and the other disciples blinked at Chu Feng mischievously before quickly leaving the area, leaving just Wang Yuxian and Chu Feng behind.<br>Wang Yuxian pushed the door open, but she didn&rsquo;t head in. Instead, she told Chu Feng, &ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, please go in.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng nodded with a smile before heading in.<br>The palace might have appeared small on the outside, but as it turned out, looks were deceiving.<br>What that appeared before Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes as soon as he stepped through the door was an extremely long corridor. He walked for quite a while before a hall finally appeared before him.<br>Stepping into the hall, he saw a massive pill cauldron placed at the center of the room, and it was currently shrouded amidst a formation.<br>The Lady of Dao Sea was standing before the pill cauldron.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, I have completed the preparations. Are you ready?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes, I am ready,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied as he began walking toward the pill cauldron.<br>He knew that the pill cauldron was something the Lady of Dao Sea had prepared for the procedure.<br>As long as he stepped into the cauldron, he would be changed. There would be something within his body that would resonate together with Wang Yuxian&rsquo;s bloodline, thus allowing him to gain the acknowledgment of the training spot and enter its grounds.<br>However, he would have to pay a price for that.<br>As soon as Chu Feng entered the pill cauldron, he felt a powerful surge of heat gushing into his body, and this surge of heat was reshaping the unique traits of his soul.<br>However, one thing that was worthy of note was that the procedure wasn&rsquo;t painful to Chu Feng at all.<br>This must have been the means of the Lady of Dao Sea. She had used her powerful energy to avoid inflicting any pain to Chu Feng, but nevertheless, Chu Feng&rsquo;s appearance was starting to change.<br>This was a change stemming from the alteration of Chu Feng&rsquo;s soul, so there was no way for him to revert it.<br>However, it didn&rsquo;t matter to him. As long as he could save the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, this was nothing much.<br>Soon, the energy had been completely assimilated into Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br>When everything was finally over, Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t help but take a look at his new appearance. He wanted to know just how he had changed.<br>&ldquo;It really does look a little ugly.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t help but chuckle to himself when he saw his own appearance.<br>It was indeed quite hideous. He looked at if he had been burnt by fire, such that his skin was nearly nonexistent.<br>This wasn&rsquo;t just at the level of hideousness. It was terrifying and nauseating.<br>Chu Feng tried to set up a formation to channel his spirit power to revert his appearance, but it was futile.<br>After that, he tried to use a concealment formation to cover his original appearance, but it was useless too. His mutated soul somehow negated the effects of the concealment formation.<br>His spirit power simply couldn&rsquo;t conceal his appearance. A mysterious power in the depths of his body would bring forth his true, hideous appearance whenever he tried to conceal it.<br></p></div>
