        <h1>Chapter 4804</h1>
        <div>: A Strong Opponent<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Brother Duan, this&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng looked at Duan Liufeng with a conflicted look on his face. He didn&rsquo;t want to miss this opportunity, but he felt that Duan Liufeng was taking a huge risk here.<br>&ldquo;You need not feel pressured. I&rsquo;ve already received the sectmaster&rsquo;s permission to use her supporting formation&hellip; Otherwise, how could I possibly dare to bring you here?&rdquo; Duan Liufeng replied with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Thanks, Brother Duan.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had no idea how he could thank Duan Liufeng for this. However, he knew that this wasn&rsquo;t the time for him to be indulging in his own emotions. There was something far more important that he had to do here.<br>So, he quickly began setting up a formation to increase his intelligence before attempting to break the final lock in the Hidden Dragon Soul Armor, which was also the lock of Heaven Soul. As long as he undid this lock, he should be able to raise his cultivation to rank two Martial Exalted level.<br>That would put him in a far better position when dealing with Zuoqiu Youyu and the elusive Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple.<br>It was just that things didn&rsquo;t go as he wished.<br>As powerful as the supporting formation was, the Heaven Soul, as the final lock to the Hidden Dragon Soul Armor, was not an easy one to breach. After some tries, he found that it would take quite some time in order for him to decipher this final seal.<br>No matter how high he raised his intelligence, he couldn&rsquo;t do it in a single shot. It had to be done bit by bit.<br>However, Chu Feng was in a huge rush. He had to make a breakthrough before tomorrow. So, he decided to abandon stability and force his way through.<br>Unfortunately, that resulted in things spiraling out of control. Nevertheless, he refused to stop. He made full use of his mental fortitude to hold on.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t a good decision as things only got worse.<br>His thoughts began to jumble up, and his mind was slowly going blank. Murderous intent even seeped into his heart. The sheer stress he was put under even made him entertain the thought of ending his own life.<br>Hualala!<br>A gigantic wave suddenly gushed through, and Chu Feng&rsquo;s body was forcefully extricated from the supporting formation.<br>Slowly, Chu Feng&rsquo;s emotions calmed down once more. He turned to look at Duan Liufeng, knowing that it was the latter who dragged him out.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu, are you out of your mind? Do you know that you nearly went berserk earlier? If I wasn&rsquo;t here, you could have very well lost your life!&rdquo; Duan Liufeng bellowed.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Brother Duan, but I have no choice. Let me give it another try,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>He headed down to the supporting formation once more, wanting to try it again. However, Duan Liufeng stopped him.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what means you have in your possession that allows you to swiftly raise your cultivation, but it&rsquo;s clear that you&rsquo;ve already reached your limit. You can&rsquo;t continue on anymore.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu, I know that you want to win the matchmaking convention very much, but you won&rsquo;t be able to do it like that. You&rsquo;re just hurting yourself for no reason. You&rsquo;ll be stopping your cultivation here today.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Duan Liufeng forcefully dragged Chu Feng away from the area. Soon, they returned to Chu Feng&rsquo;s residence in the North Tortoise Hall.<br>Along the way, Chu Feng pleaded with Duan Liufeng to give him another try, but it was futile. In the end, he lowered his head in disappointment upon realizing that it was impossible for him to convince Duan Liufeng.<br>&ldquo;Is it really worth it for you to go this far for a woman?&rdquo; Duan Liufeng asked.<br>He had known Chu Feng for some time now, and he admired Chu Feng&rsquo;s character greatly.<br>Chu Feng had the hot-bloodedness of youth, but at the same time, he was as meticulous as those in the older generation as well.<br>This was the first time he had seen Chu Feng acting so recklessly, to the extent that it could even be dubbed as illogical. However, this also showed how important this matter was to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brother Duan, would you believe me if I were to tell you that Zi Ling is my wedded wife?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; are here for Zi Ling?&rdquo; Duan Liufeng asked.<br>&ldquo;Yes. Everything I&rsquo;ve done is with the intent of taking her away with me,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>At this point, Duan Liufeng finally understood why Chu Feng viewed this matter so important. So, he decided not to probe any deeper but instead took an item out of his Cosmos Sack.<br>&ldquo;Take this,&rdquo; Duan Liufeng said as he tossed a box toward Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng opened the box, only to see a black pill lying within. The pill looked perfectly ordinary in terms of appearances, but the medicinal energy that gushed out as soon as the box was opened told him that this pill was no ordinary item.<br>It was a forbidden medicine, but not any ordinary one.<br>This forbidden medicine could raise even the cultivation of a Martial Exalted level cultivator by a rank! On top of that, it harnessed a powerful hidden formation that was deeply melded with the medicinal energy.<br>What surprised Chu Feng the most was how gentle this powerful medicinal energy was. This meant that the forbidden medicine wouldn&rsquo;t deal much harm to him after consumption.<br>But this defied the very concept of what a forbidden medicine was!<br>&ldquo;This is an ancient forbidden medicine I&rsquo;ve found in an ancient remnant. I&rsquo;ve seen someone consuming it before, so I know its medicinal properties well. It should be able to raise your cultivation by a rank after consumption, and you&rsquo;ll be able to hide this temporary advancement in your cultivation, such that no one will be able to discern it. With this, you can catch your opponent off-guard and defeat him.<br>&ldquo;On top of that, this forbidden medicine is extremely gentle on the body. You won&rsquo;t sustain too much harm after consumption. That being said, it&rsquo;s still a forbidden medicine, so it&rsquo;s inevitable that you&rsquo;ll suffer some damage. You&rsquo;ll have to be prepared for that,&rdquo; Duan Liufeng said.<br>&ldquo;Brother Duan, I really don&rsquo;t know how I can thank you for this&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was deeply moved by Duan Liufeng&rsquo;s favor.<br>Forbidden medicine could raise a person&rsquo;s fighting prowess, but its side effects tended to be devastating as well. Even forbidden medicine that raised a person&rsquo;s cultivation at Utmost Exalted level could inflict irreparable damage, but this forbidden medicine that allowed him to raise his cultivation at Martial Exalted level minimized the harm that would fall upon him.<br>It was obvious just how valuable this forbidden medicine was.<br>Yet, Duan Liufeng gave it to him without any hesitation. How could he ever repay this debt of gratitude?<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to say such words. We&rsquo;re brothers, after all. Since Miss Zi Ling is that important to you&hellip; I wish you all the best for tomorrow,<br>&ldquo;However, you shouldn&rsquo;t blame yourself too much if you were to lose in the matchmaking convention. Zuoqiu Youyu is one thing, but the disciple brought back by the sectmaster is a formidable individual. It&rsquo;s not just due to the sectmaster&rsquo;s favor that he&rsquo;s able to sit in the position of the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple. Rather, he really is qualified for that position.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to shatter your confidence, but there&rsquo;s a better chance of the engagement being annulled due to Miss Zi Ling&rsquo;s rejection than you defeating him,&rdquo; Duan Liufeng said.<br></p></div>
