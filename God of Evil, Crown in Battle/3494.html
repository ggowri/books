        <h1>Chapter 3493</h1>
        <div> - Terrifyingly Powerful<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Young lady, you&rsquo;re very powerful.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would appear that the power Chu Feng was using earlier belonged to you?&rdquo; Linghu Hongfei asked.<br>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s actually her power? No wonder, no wonder.&rdquo;<br>Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s words brought enlightenment to many people.<br>However, the female world spirit completely ignored Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s question. Instead, she waved her arm, and boundless black gaseous flames burst forth from her body like a volcanic eruption.<br>After the black gaseous flames appeared, a very disturbing aura was immediately felt.<br>The crowd were unable to determine exactly what sort of black gaseous flames those were. They were simply unable to keep themselves from feeling fear toward it.<br>Even the monstrous beasts present, whose nature was more vicious than humans, started to have goosebumps when confronted with the female world spirit&rsquo;s black gaseous flames.<br>&ldquo;Roar~~~&rdquo;<br>In a manner capable of toppling mountains and overturning seas, the black gaseous flames pounced toward Linghu Hongfei, who stood at the edge of the fighting stage.<br>The sight simply looked like a gigantic demonic being, about to devour a lowly human.<br>However, Linghu Hongfei showed no fear when facing the female world spirit&rsquo;s attack.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Linghu Hongfei waved his arm, and a slash of light swept forth. The slash of light actually managed to forcibly slash the incoming black gaseous flames in two, making them fly past him.<br>At that moment, the crowd noticed that the weapon in Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s hand had changed.<br>He had put away the Immortal Armament sword he was using previously.<br>At that moment, he was holding a silver blade in his hand. That blade was very long, measuring three meters and three centimeters. The blade&rsquo;s edge took up half of the entire length of the blade.<br>Although the blade was not excessively adorned, it was incomparably sharp, and emitted an extraordinary aura.<br>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that?!&rdquo;<br>Many people&rsquo;s expressions changed upon seeing the blade.<br>The blade was named Silverlight Heaven-splitting Blade. It was an Incomplete Exalted Armament.<br>Although the number of Utmost Exalted-level experts in the Ancestral Martial Starfield could be counted with one&rsquo;s fingers, there were quite a lot of Exalted-level experts.<br>True Immortal-level experts were capable of using Incomplete Immortal Armaments and strengthening their own battle power using the power of the Incomplete Immortal Armament.<br>Likewise, Exalted-level experts were capable of using Incomplete Exalted Armaments.<br>Unfortunately, Incomplete Exalted Armaments were simply too precious. They were so precious that every one of them was deemed to be a priceless treasure capable of creating a bloody storm where people killed one another fighting over it.<br>The people that were capable of possessing Incomplete Exalted Armaments were all renowned existences. They were all excellent and well-known individuals, even among Exalted realm experts.<br>The reason why Incomplete Exalted Armaments were so precious was because they were weapons ordinary world spiritists were incapable of forging.<br>Reportedly, only Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists were capable of forging Incomplete Exalted Armaments. Furthermore, they would have to spend an enormous amount of effort in order to forge a single Incomplete Exalted Armament.<br>However, as everyone knew, even the strongest world spiritist of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, Grandmaster Liangqiu, was only a Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist not long ago.<br>Because of that, it was thought that there was simply no one in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield that was capable of forging Incomplete Exalted Armaments.<br>Precisely because of how incomparably precious Incomplete Exalted Armaments were, practically all the Incomplete Exalted Armaments in the Ancestral Martial Starfield had extraordinary origins. Many of the experts from the older generation could recognize them all, and knew their names.<br>The Incomplete Exalted Armament that Linghu Hongfei was holding, the Silverlight Heaven-splitting Blade, was an Incomplete Exalted Armament kept in collection by the Linghu Heavenly Clan.<br>Originally, the Silverlight Heaven-splitting Blade was a weapon used by a peak expert of the Linghu Heavenly Clan. Yet, at this moment, it had actually appeared in Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s possession.<br>The crowd were astonished by the Linghu Heavenly Clan giving such a precious weapon to a person of the younger generation to keep and use.<br>However, although they were astonished, they were capable of understanding the Linghu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s decision. After all, Linghu Hongfei was not an ordinary person of the younger generation. Besides, to the Linghu Heavenly Clan, what could possibly be more precious than Linghu Hongfei himself?<br>&ldquo;Incomplete Exalted Armaments are weapons beyond measure.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With that weapon in hand, Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s battle power will inevitably increase enormously. How is that woman going to contend against him now?&rdquo;<br>Many people began to feel that Linghu Hongfei would have a greater chance of victory.<br>Although the female world spirit&rsquo;s initial attack had made him suffer a major loss, after seeing the renowned Incomplete Exalted Armament, the crowd felt that the battle had turned against the female world spirit.<br>&ldquo;Since young lady is not fond of words, I, Linghu Hongfei, will no longer speak excessively. Merely, the weapon in my hand is somewhat extraordinarily powerful. Even I find it very difficult to control it. If young lady is unable to withstand it later, I hope you'll be able to voice your concession, so that I can stop before harming you,&rdquo; Linghu Hongfei said to the female world spirit while holding the Silverlight Heaven-splitting Blade in hand.<br>&ldquo;Huu~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, the black gaseous flame emitted by the female world spirit began to return to her.<br>Soon, the black gaseous flames turned into black armor that covered her completely. A black spear also appeared in her hand.<br>That armor and spear looked very familiar.<br>Wasn&rsquo;t that the same armor and spear Chu Feng was using earlier?<br>However, that was understandable too. After all, that power belonged to the female world spirit to begin with.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the female world spirit unleashed her attack again.<br>Seeing that, Linghu Hongfei stopped hesitating. He held his Incomplete Exalted Armament and soared into the sky toward the incoming female world spirit.<br>The two of them were both extremely fast, practically evenly matched. In the blink of an eye, they collided.<br>Due to the fact that their speed was too fast, all of the younger generations present, including Chu Feng, were unable to see their movements.<br>They could only hear the sound of weapons colliding, see the sparks from the collision and the energy ripples that wreaked havoc throughout, filling up the entire stage.<br>&ldquo;Grandfather, what&rsquo;s the situation like?&rdquo;<br>Gong Qing looked to the Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>Once she spoke, practically all of the Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations, including Gong Mingyue, turned to look at the Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>They all wanted to know what the situation of the battle was like at that moment. They wanted to know who was winning.<br>The Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s aged eyes were filled with astonishment. When he raised his hand to stroke his beard, his arm was actually trembling slightly.<br>&ldquo;Amazing. Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spirit is simply terrifyingly powerful.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even though that black spear of hers is clearly formed with her power, even an Incomplete Exalted Armament like the Silverlight Heaven-splitting Blade is unable to gain any superiority over it.&rdquo;<br>Astonishment filled the Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s voice.<br>At that moment, that expert of the older generation, the chief of a clan, was no longer able to watch the battle before him with a calm mind.<br></p></div>
