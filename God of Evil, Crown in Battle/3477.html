        <div> - The Hidden Path&rsquo;s Demon-suppression Incantations<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;That is the hidden path of certain death. For Chu Feng to leap in like that, isn&rsquo;t that akin to courting death?&rdquo;<br>Many people were surprised by his action. This was especially true in regards to the people that did not know him well, and had bet on him using their Immortal Martial Stones.<br>Originally, they had hoped that Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength would be heaven-defying, and he would obtain first place in the selection, so that they could make a huge profit.<br>But now, all the Immortal Martial Stones that they had bet on Chu Feng were going to be completely squandered.<br>As for Chu Feng, he did not consider it too much. He had made his decision subconsciously in an instant.<br>After all, Wuma Shengjie had been sent onto the hidden path of certain death due to saving him. Thus, how could he possibly do nothing about it?<br>Chu Feng immediately found Wuma Shengjie upon entering the thirteenth entrance.<br>Wuma Shengjie was sitting by the entrance. Lightning had assailed her body, and winds had assailed her bones. Because of that, she was quite seriously injured.<br>She sat there treating her injuries.<br>Upon seeing Wuma Shengjie, Chu Feng, without saying anything, immediately went to lend her a hand in treating her injuries.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, why did you come here?&rdquo;<br>Wuma Shengjie was very surprised to see Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak,&rdquo; Chu Feng said. Then, he continued to treat Wuma Shengjie&rsquo;s injuries.<br>Although her injury was quite serious, she was fortunate that Chu Feng had immediately arrived to help treat her. Furthermore, as the Dark Black Wind And Lightning Talisman&rsquo;s main effect lay in paralysis, and did not possess fatal powers, she quickly began to recover.<br>As for the rest, Wuma Shengjie would have to slowly nurse herself to a full recovery.<br>&ldquo;Why did you follow me in? Are you trying to die?&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie looked to Chu Feng in a rather furious manner.<br>&ldquo;Then why did you block the attack for me? Are you trying to die?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Who was trying to block the attack for you? I was trying to immediately dodge after pushing you away. Unfortunately, I underestimated that thing&rsquo;s speed. That was why I ended up being struck by it. That was a mishap on my part. I was not deliberately trying to save you,&rdquo; said Wuma Shengjie.<br>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you still save me?&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;We are friends, after all. How could I do nothing when I saw you in danger?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, why were you staring at this hidden path of certain death earlier? You actually failed to notice that Linghu Tiemian sneaking his way over,&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie said.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough. It was my fault, okay? Since we&rsquo;ve already come here, let&rsquo;s think of a way to get out of this place,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that we will have to experience this so-called hidden path of certain death,&rdquo; said Wuma Shengjie.<br>The reason why she said that was because both she and Chu Feng could tell that the path that they had come from had disappeared. Behind them was a wall. The wall was so tough and firm that they were simply unable to breach it.<br>Thus, they had no choice but to go forward.<br>&ldquo;Come, let&rsquo;s go. If it&rsquo;s a blessing, then it would not be a calamity. If it&rsquo;s a calamity, we will not be able to avoid it,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled. Then, his body shifted as he leapt forward on the unknown path ahead.<br>&ldquo;This guy, does he not know fear?&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie was speechless.<br>This was clearly the place verified as a hidden path of certain death.<br>Had it been others that ended up falling into that place, they would definitely be terror-stricken, and might even weep bitter tears.<br>However, Chu Feng showed absolutely no sign of fear. Instead, he was even smiling. It was as if he simply did not regard that place as a hidden path of certain death, but rather an interesting place to adventure in.<br>She sighed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no wonder they say that simple-minded people live more merrily. It would appear that is indeed the case.&rdquo; Then, her body shifted as she flew after Chu Feng.<br>The hidden path that they were in was a downward slope. As such, Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie continued to travel deep underground.<br>Originally, the path ahead did not appear to be strange at all. However, as they continued to journey forward, a large amount of runes and symbols suddenly appeared ahead of them.<br>&ldquo;What powerful symbols and runes. Could these be&hellip; Demon-suppression Incantations?&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie looked to Chu Feng. She was uncertain, as the runes and symbols appeared to be extremely exceptional and powerful.<br>As it was too complicated, even she was couldn&rsquo;t be certain of what it was.<br>That said, unease also appeared in her eyes. Although she was couldn&rsquo;t be certain, she guessed that they were most likely Demon-suppression Incantations.<br>As a world spiritist, she naturally knew what Demon-suppression Incantations were for.<br>Demon-suppression Incantations were used to suppress Evil Spirits. The power of the Demon-suppression Incantations represented how powerful the sealed Evil Spirits were.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, these are Demon-suppression Incantations. Furthermore, they&rsquo;re extremely powerful ones on top of that. They were most definitely not left behind by an ordinary world spiritist.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If there are really Evil Spirits in this place, they will likely not be things that you or I could handle,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What are we to do then? Are we just going to wait for death here?&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie asked.<br>&ldquo;Waiting for death would be extremely boring. How about courting death?&rdquo; Chu Feng suggested.<br>&ldquo;Sure. Since you&rsquo;re going to share my fate, death will not be lonely,&rdquo; after Wuma Shengjie finished saying those words, her body shifted, and she entered the region covered in Demon-suppression Incantations and continued inward.<br>Seeing Wuma Shengjie act like that, a smile rose at the corners of Chu Feng&rsquo;s mouth.<br>Perhaps because of what she had experienced in her childhood, Wuma Shengjie had a rather cold temperament, and would always keep people at a distance of a thousand miles.<br>However, it was evident that she was currently shedding her protective barrier. At the very least, she had become much warmer before Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng took a step forward, and leapt further down the hidden path to follow Wuma Shengjie.<br>That said, the two of them had no idea that, when they entered the region covered in Demon-suppression Incantations, a change had occurred to the thirteenth hidden path&rsquo;s entrance.<br>After the entrance was struck by the abnormal sign&rsquo;s lightning, it became covered with lightning. Even though the abnormal sign had disappeared, the lightning remained without disappearing.<br>However, at that moment, that lightning was starting to change. It formed the image of two people in the center of the entrance.<br>Although slightly fuzzy, the crowd were able to roughly distinguish them to be Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie.<br>&ldquo;The lightning actually projected the image of Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie. Why would there be this sudden change?&rdquo;<br>Seeing the change to the thirteenth path&rsquo;s entrance, the crowd began to discuss it spiritedly.<br>Even Grandmaster Liangqiu, Wuming Xingyun and the others were couldn&rsquo;t decide what it represented.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that the two of them have gone deep down the hidden path,&rdquo; at the moment when the crowd were all confused, the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief spoke.<br>&ldquo;Clan Chief Tantai, could the image projected by the lightning be indicating something?&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu asked.<br>&ldquo;What Grandmaster Liangqiu's thinking is correct. The image projected from the lightning is indeed indicating something. It represents Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie&rsquo;s lives.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If the image still exists, they are still alive.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If the image disappears, they'll have died,&rdquo; the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief explained.<br></p></div>
