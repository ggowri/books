        <div> - Peach Garden Immortal<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chu Feng and the others entered the Peach Garden Mystic Realm.<br>The Peach Garden Mystic Realm was an isolated space. Being there, Chu Feng and the others felt as if they were floating above the boundless starry sky, as a sea of stars filled their surroundings.<br>However, what was flashing with light were not stars and planets. Instead, they were symbols and characters. Both the symbols and characters originated from the Ancient Era. Chu Feng and the others were all unable to recognize any of the symbols or characters.<br>However, without any need to ask, they could tell that those symbols and characters contained some profound nature. It seemed that what they contained was not limited to only martial comprehension.<br>Not to mention Wuma Shengjie and Chu Feng, even Gong Qing was able to sense it.<br>Thus, upon entering that place, Wuma Shengjie and Gong Qing were both captivated by their surroundings.<br>Chu Feng, on the other hand, was worried about something else, &ldquo;Miss Tantai, is Lord Wuming Xingyun currently within your Tantai Heavenly Clan?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;My apologies. I had forgotten to inform young master Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Wuming Xingyun is indeed in our Tantai Heavenly Clan. Lord Wuming Xingyun told me to let you know that your friend is fine, should you be able to participate in this gathering of the younger generations,&rdquo; said Tantai Xing&rsquo;er.<br>Chu Feng evidently became much more at ease upon hearing those words. Thus, Tantai Xing&rsquo;er continued, &ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, young master Wuma, little sister Gong Qing, allow me to provide you all with an introduction. Perhaps our clan&rsquo;s Peach Garden Mystic Realm might be able to provide you all with assistance.&rdquo;<br>Tantai Xing&rsquo;er began to give an account of the Peach Garden Mystic Realm to Chu Feng and the others.<br>The Peach Garden Mystic Realm originated from the Ancient Era. To be precise, the Mountain Peach Garden originated from the Ancient Era.<br>The Mountain Peach Garden and the Peach Garden Mystic Realm were actually one and the same.<br>The name Mountain Peach Garden was given to it by people after the Ancient Era, whereas the name &lsquo;Peach Garden Mystic Realm&rsquo; came from the Ancient Era.<br>The person who named the Peach Garden Mystic Realm was called the Peach Garden Immortal. That Peach Garden Immortal was also the creator of the Peach Garden Mystic Realm.<br>Thus, the Peach Garden Mystic Realm could be said to be a remnant left behind by the Peach Garden Immortal for future generations. As long as one possessed sufficient comprehensive ability, one would be able to pass through the mountain and enter the Mystic Realm to obtain enlightenment.<br>As matters stood, the Tantai Heavenly Clan had already grasped the method to pass through the mountain and enter the Peach Garden, as well as the method to activate the Peach Garden Mystic Realm.<br>However, the amount of comprehension one would be able to attain would depend on one&rsquo;s own aptitude.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only known that the Peach Garden Mystic Realm is a sacred cultivation ground. Never did I imagine that it was from the Ancient Era, and that it was created by a Peach Garden Immortal.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Learning of this has made things completely different. Thank you, miss Xing&rsquo;er.&rdquo; Gong Qing said, then asked, &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right. Miss Xing&rsquo;er, wasn&rsquo;t it said that the Peach Garden Mystic Realm is written here? How come I can&rsquo;t see it?&rdquo; .<br>&ldquo;Indeed, the Peach Garden Mystic Realm is written here. However, only those with sufficient comprehensive capability will be able to see it. Little sister Gong Qing, you can attempt to carefully and earnestly look for it. If you&rsquo;re able to see the name of the Peach Garden Mystic Realm, you will have gained martial comprehension from this place, and should be able to increase your cultivation,&rdquo; Tantai Xing&rsquo;er said.<br>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the case. I&rsquo;ll give it a try right now,&rdquo; As Gong Qing spoke, she immediately used her special observation method to observe her surroundings.<br>As for Wuma Shengjie, she had actually already begun observing her surroundings even before Gong Qing.<br>Only Chu Feng was looking at his surroundings with an ordinary gaze. He looked as if he wasn&rsquo;t using any special methods to observe his surroundings at all.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, there&rsquo;s a limit as to how long one can stay in this place. After an hour passes, we will be teleported out.&rdquo; Tantai Xing&rsquo;er said to Chu Feng. She wanted to warn Chu Feng that he must not waste his time, and should carefully observe things.<br>&ldquo;Miss Tantai, thank you for your reminder,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled gratefully at Tantai Xing&rsquo;er. After he finished thanking her, he continued with his observation.<br>However, Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze remained ordinary. He still appeared to not be using any special observational method at all.<br>This greatly puzzled Tantai Xing&rsquo;er. She had already reminded him, yet Chu Feng was still not serious. She was truly unable to understand him. She wanted to say something. However, in the end, she said nothing.<br>Tantai Xing&rsquo;er had no idea that Chu Feng had been observing the entire time. Furthermore, he was using his strongest observational method, the Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, to observe his surroundings.<br>The Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes was a method taught to Chu Feng by Her Lady Queen. In terms of observational methods, they were extremely powerful.<br>As Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength increased, he no longer looked different when using his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes to observe things. Even when using his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, others would not know he was using it.<br>This was the reason why Tantai Xing&rsquo;er ended up having this sort of misunderstanding toward him.<br>&hellip;...<br>The gathering of the younger generation was still ongoing. However, the crowd&rsquo;s eyes would occasionally shift to the Peach Garden Mystic Realm floating in midair.<br>They all felt extremely envious, and wanted to know exactly what was happening in there.<br>That said, those people of the younger generation actually had no idea that at a certain place on the mountain, one could see the situation inside the Peach Garden Mystic Realm.<br>That place was the formation core of the Peach Garden Mystic Realm.<br>The formation core was required to summon and activate the Peach Garden Mystic Realm.<br>Furthermore, as long as the Peach Garden Mystic Realm was summoned, the formation core would allow one to see the situation inside.<br>Of course, if one wanted to comprehend the mysteries contained in the Peach Garden Mystic Realm, one would have to enter it to sincerely experience it. Thus, even though the people inside the formation core were able to see what was going on inside, they would not be able to comprehend anything.<br>Yet, the elders in charge of looking after the formation core were still looking through the formation core and completely focused on Chu Feng and the others inside the Peach Garden Mystic Realm.<br>&ldquo;Lord Elder, why would young miss&hellip; spend such precious resources to allow those people to enter the Peach Garden Mystic Realm? This is too much of a waste, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, ignoring that Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generation, Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie are both young miss&rsquo;s competitors. Why would young miss help them like this?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This junior has pondered young miss&rsquo;s decision for a long time, yet I am still unable to understand it. Lord Elder, could you please provide me with guidance?&rdquo; A world spiritist that could be considered to be very young amongst the people there voiced the question on his mind.<br>Once he asked that question, ignoring the elders with the greatest authority present, even the other elders laughed out loud.<br>&ldquo;A&rsquo;zhong, you&rsquo;ve only been in the Peach Mountain Garden for a short period of time. Thus, you still don&rsquo;t understand it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You should know how many Purple-marked Spirit Stones are normally required to enter the Peach Garden Mystic Realm, right?&rdquo; An old man who seemed to hold a lot of authority asked.<br>&ldquo;Lord Elder, a hundred thousand Purple-marked Spirit Stones is required,&rdquo; that young world spiritist replied.<br>&ldquo;In that case, including young miss, exactly how many Purple-marked Spirit Stones were spent to allow four people to enter the Peach Garden Mystic Realm today?&rdquo; The old man asked.<br>&ldquo;Forty thousand,&rdquo; the young world spiritist replied. He soon added, &ldquo;Lord Elder, I actually also wanted to ask about that. Normally, allowing four people to enter the Peach Garden Mystic Realm would cost four hundred thousand Purple-marked Spirit Stones. Why were they able to enter with only forty thousand Purple-marked Spirit Stones?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Haha. That&rsquo;s precisely what this old man is going to teach you today.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Firstly, Purple-marked Spirit Stones are items that come from the Ancient Era. The reason why they&rsquo;re so precious is because they&rsquo;re limited in quantity. One day, we will end up consuming all of them. At that time, we will not be able to activate our clan&rsquo;s Peach Garden Mystic Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The outside rumor has been that it would require a hundred thousand Purple-marked Spirit Stones to allow someone to enter the Peach Garden Mystic Realm. While that rumor is true, it is not absolute.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Actually, ten thousand Purple-marked Spirit Stones will be able to allow one to enter. The same holds true for twenty thousand or thirty thousand.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In short, at least ten thousand Purple-marked Spirit Stones are required for a single person to enter the Peach Garden Mystic Realm, whereas the maximum number allowed is a hundred thousand.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do you know why there&rsquo;s such a major difference in the quantity?&rdquo; The old man asked.<br>&ldquo;Senior, could it be related to the mysteries of the Peach Garden Mystic Realm?&rdquo; the young world spiritist asked.<br>&ldquo;Smart. As expected of a good sapling selected meticulously by our clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve answered correctly. The more spirit stones we spend, the more mysteries one will be able to comprehend inside the Peach Garden Mystic Realm,&rdquo; replied the old man.<br>&ldquo;In that case, how much could one comprehend with ten thousand Purple-marked Spirit Stones?&rdquo; asked the young world spiritist.<br>&ldquo;Haha&hellip;&rdquo; The old man let out a strange laugh, &ldquo;Ten thousand Purple-marked Spirit Stones is only sufficient to let one in to have a look, and not enough to comprehend anything.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; The young world spiritist came to a sudden realization upon hearing those words.<br>It turned out that all this was nothing more than a farce. Although Tantai Xing&rsquo;er appeared to be magnanimous, she was actually deceiving Chu Feng and the others.<br></p></div>
