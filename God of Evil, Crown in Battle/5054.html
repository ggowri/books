        <h1>Chapter 5053</h1>
        <div>: The Person Whom That Man Was Waiting For<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Pah!<br>The powerful oppressive might dispersed before it could get close to Chu Feng. Someone had protected him from the attack.<br>A silhouette swooped in to stand in between Chu Feng and the others from the Monstrous Spirit Clan. It was none other than Yao Cheng.<br>&ldquo;Yao Cheng? You were the one who blocked my oppressive might?&rdquo; a middle-aged woman asked.<br>She was the current clan chief of the Monstrous Spirit Clan, as well as the one who had released her oppressive might to attack Chu Feng earlier. Despite having seen Yao Cheng&rsquo;s interception, she still asked the question out of sheer disbelief.<br>She didn&rsquo;t think that Yao Cheng would dare stand in her way. Anyone who opposed the clan chief in the Monstrous Spirit Clan would be deemed a traitor of the clan, and that was a crime that warranted capital punishment!<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, I know that it isn&rsquo;t right of me to be doing this, but this is all for the sake of the Monstrous Spirit Clan. I hope that you can pardon me for this.&rdquo;<br>Out of fear of the clan chief, Yao Cheng quickly kneeled to the floor and asked for forgiveness.<br>&ldquo;How dare you, Yao Cheng? Why are you siding with an outsider?&rdquo;<br>The crowd berated Yao Cheng upon hearing her confession.<br>&ldquo;Yao Cheng, were you the one who brought this man in?&rdquo; the Monstrous Spirit Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, I was indeed the one who brought this young friend in. He&rsquo;s currently the most talented prodigy of the eastern region, and he entered our Monstrous Spirit Clan with his own ability. I beseech you to allow him to finish the talent assessment. He might just be the person who could change the fate of our Monstrous Spirit Clan,&rdquo; Yao Cheng said.<br>&ldquo;You actually brought an outsider into our Monstrous Spirit Clan&hellip; Do you honestly believe that an outsider can change our Monstrous Spirit Clan? Yao Cheng, do you even know what you&rsquo;re doing? You&rsquo;re betraying our clan here!&rdquo;<br>The crowd from the Monstrous Spirit Clan grew even more infuriated upon hearing her words.<br>However, the Monstrous Spirit Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief didn&rsquo;t say a word. There was a complicated look in her eyes that showed apprehension and anticipation. She was worried that Chu Feng might just succeed here, but at the same time, she also hoped for him to succeed.<br>It was then that the spirit power that had enveloped Chu Feng returned into the formation, but there was no other reaction after a moment of silence.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Mocking laughter echoed from the members of the Monstrous Spirit Clan. The result of the talent assessment formation would usually show by now, but none of the stone tablets had lit up. This showed that Chu Feng was of mediocre talent.<br>&ldquo;Yao Cheng, is this person whom you said could change our Monstrous Spirit Clan? How foolish!&rdquo; the Monstrous Spirit Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;How could this be?&rdquo;<br>Yao Cheng also panicked at that sight. She had seen what Chu Feng was capable of, so she thought that he would have at least been able to trigger the &lsquo;Lower&rsquo; character stone tablet. In fact, she was fairly confident that he would be able to trigger the &lsquo;Middle&rsquo; character stone tablet, and that was the reason why she dared to bring Chu Feng in here.<br>Yet, the result was completely different from what she had envisioned.<br>&ldquo;Yao Cheng, it looks like your plan has fallen empty. You betrayed our clan just to bring in a mediocre talent who doesn&rsquo;t even match up to our own juniors. Since you have chosen to side with an outsider, I&rsquo;ll allow you to die with him. Members of the Monstrous Spirit Clan, activate the formation!&rdquo; the Monstrous Spirit Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief ordered.<br>The Monstrous Spirit Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the other clan members began emanating a peculiar aura that converged on the clan chief.<br>Chu Feng could sense the aura of the Monstrous Spirit Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief swiftly strengthening, and he figured that this was the defensive formation that Yao Cheng spoke of.<br>&ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; a woman&rsquo;s voice suddenly echoed.<br>A person descended from the sky and landed beside Chu Feng. It was Wang Yuxian.<br>&ldquo;Elder, I have no idea why you view us in hostility, but we bear no ill-will toward the Monstrous Spirit Clan. I plead with you to give me a chance to prove myself through the talent assessment formation,&rdquo; Wang Yuxian said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, come down,&rdquo; Yao Cheng said.<br>The talent assessment formation would only activate when a single person was standing on it. Since Chu Feng&rsquo;s result was less than satisfactory, they could only count on Wang Yuxian here.<br>Chu Feng understood what Yao Cheng meant, so he quickly leaped down from the talent assessment formation and headed over to Yao Cheng&rsquo;s side.<br>Weng!<br>Shortly after Chu Feng stepped away, the talent assessment formation began to trigger. A layer of spirit power shrouded Wang Yuxian before seeping back into the formation.<br>Weng!<br>A brilliant pillar of light rushed into the sky.<br>&ldquo;That is&hellip;!&rdquo;<br>The crowd was astonished by what they were seeing, for the pillar of light was coming from the &lsquo;Upper&rsquo; character stone tablet.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, this&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The members of the Monstrous Spirit Clan turned to look at their clan chief. Some of them even stopped channeling their auras toward the clan chief, knowing that they couldn&rsquo;t harm Chu Feng and Wang Yuxian anymore.<br>The Monstrous Spirit Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief found the situation hard to believe, but she also chose to dissipate her aura too and retract her oppressive might.<br>&ldquo;I never thought that a junior would possess such great talent. Is this heaven&rsquo;s will?&rdquo; the Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief lamented.<br>Then, she turned to Wang Yuxian and asked, &ldquo;This miss over here, what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;<br>The hostility had already vanished from her eyes, and her words became much gentler.<br>&ldquo;I am Wang Yuxian,&rdquo; Wang Yuxian replied.<br>&ldquo;Wang Yuxian&hellip; are you the lass who has been cultivating outside our Monstrous Spirit Clan?&rdquo; the Monstrous Spirit Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>She seemed to have heard of Wang Yuxian&rsquo;s name.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, it&rsquo;s indeed her. She&rsquo;s the talented young lady whom I told you about,&rdquo; Yao Cheng replied.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, look over there!&rdquo;<br>Someone suddenly pointed toward the statue in the middle of the square and exclaimed. The crowd turned their eyes over and lurched in shock.<br>The man in the statue had turned completely to stone, and this included the possessions on him such as his clothes and his Cosmos Sacktoo. However, a change had occurred to the pearl pendant he wore around his neck. It hadn&rsquo;t garnered much attention back when it was still petrified, but it looked awfully conspicuous now that it had reverted to its original appearance.<br>The pearl pendant resembled a glass container half filled with some sort of glowing fluid.<br>&ldquo;The lord&rsquo;s treasure is reacting to her? Could she be the person whom the lord was waiting for?&rdquo;<br>All eyes immediately turned to Wang Yuxian.<br></p></div>
