        <div> - Disastrous Losses<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That elder was holding a mirror in his hand. Looking through the mirror, even the violently surging energy ripples disappeared.<br>Through the mirror, he was able to clearly see the situation far ahead.<br>&ldquo;Let me see." Tuoba Chengan snatched the mirror from that elder.<br>The other elders gathered around Tuoba Chengan. They too wanted to see what was happening.<br>Upon seeing through the mirror, their expressions changed enormously.<br>Through the mirror, they were able to see the blood-red gaseous flames emitted by the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted had become extremely sparse, whereas the golden energies emitted by Chu Feng remained as boundless as before.<br>Although the two of them were still engaged in battle, this was simply a comparison of a river to a stream.<br>Merely, the person who was akin to the stream was the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted, and the person akin to the river was Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a loud sound was heard.<br>Even though the people from the All-heaven Sect were over ten thousand miles away, they were still able to hear the loud sound clearly.<br>Chu Feng had unleashed another fierce attack.<br>His attack this time was much fiercer than all of his previous attacks.<br>Under his attack this time, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s attack was completely shattered. Even the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted himself was completely destroyed by Chu Feng&rsquo;s attack.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted actually lost?&rdquo;<br>Seeing this, Tuoba Chengan and the other elders of the All-heaven Sect all turned deathly pale. Shock and fear filled their faces.<br>Even though they already knew that the spirit formation power Chu Feng had obtained could only be used within a certain range, they still felt fear from the bottom of their hearts after witnessing the overwhelming power he displayed.<br>They were afraid, afraid of what might happen should Chu Feng be able to break free from the range restriction.<br>If Chu Feng was able to break free from that range restriction, then, with the power of the spirit formation that he had obtained, they would all die.<br>Furthermore, Chu Feng being able to gain control of that overwhelming spirit formation was already unimaginable in and of itself. Thus, it was not an impossibility that he might be able to break away from the restrictions.<br>&ldquo;Lord Supreme Elder, we&hellip; what should we do?&rdquo;<br>In a panic, the crowd all turned their gazes to Tuoba Chengan.<br>With the situation being as it was, they could only turn to Tuoba Chengan for a decision.<br>&ldquo;What else can we do? We&rsquo;ll naturally have to leave this place.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a voice was heard.<br>Once that voice was heard, the expressions of the crowd all changed.<br>The reason for that was because that voice did not come from Tuoba Chengan. Furthermore, it also did not belong to anyone else present.<br>Looking towards the voice, the crowd&rsquo;s expressions all changed enormously.<br>A figure had appeared in their camp.<br>That person was actually the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.<br>But, they&rsquo;d clearly witnessed the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted being killed by Chu Feng!<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so shocked. This Exalted won&rsquo;t die so easily,&rdquo; said the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.<br>Although he was still alive and had fled, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted had a very ugly look on his face. This meant that he&hellip; was injured.<br>&ldquo;Heavenly Exalted, is there any other way to take care of that child?&rdquo; asked Tuoba Chengan.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve also witnessed the power he currently possesses. Even this Exalted is unable to handle him, what can you possibly do?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, this old man will advise you not to think of waiting for him here, waiting for him to leave the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb to take care of him then. That would not be a sensible act at all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although the power of the spirit formation can only be used within the vicinity of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb, he is able to use that spirit formation to teleport himself far away from here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, it&rsquo;s practically impossible to stand guard here and wait for him to leave the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb to attack him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible for that boy to be so stupid as to strut out here so that you all can capture him,&rdquo; said the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Does that mean&hellip; we must admit defeat just like that?&rdquo; asked Tuoba Chengan.<br>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve gained the decisive opportunity, and received the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s true inheritance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No matter how powerful the spirit formation&rsquo;s power that my Bloodjade Horsetail Whisk absorbed is, it is still inferior to the actual inheritance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although I really do not wish to admit defeat, this Exalted has no choice but to admit that I&rsquo;ve lost this time around," the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted shook his head helplessly as he said those words.<br>&ldquo;Heavenly Exalted, since that&rsquo;s the case, our All-heaven Sect will not be able to honor the promised rewards,&rdquo; said Tuoba Chengan.<br>Tuoba Chengan had a slightly nervous expression as he said those words.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? You&rsquo;re having a falling out with me this quickly?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that this Exalted saving you all earlier is not something even more charitable, something even more worthy of your gratitude?&rdquo;<br>The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s gaze turned cold and gloomy as he said those words.<br>At the same time, the surroundings instantly turned frigid. It seemed like they&rsquo;d suddenly entered an endlessly cold winter.<br>That said, it was not true coldness. Rather, the coldness came from the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s powerful cowering force.<br>Even Tuoba Chengan became afraid.<br>After all, he had already heard that the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was not only someone with exceptional world spirit techniques, but his own cultivation was also extremely powerful.<br>Merely, no one knew exactly what cultivation the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted possessed.<br>That said, one thing was certain -- all those that offended the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted ended up suffering miserably.<br>The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was a very dangerous individual. It was precisely because he was so dangerous that not even their All-heaven Sect was willing to conduct business with him.<br>If it wasn&rsquo;t for Grandmaster Ouyang being scared away, and Grandmaster Huang not being a match for the Mystic Cave Saints, Tuoba Chengan wouldn&rsquo;t have been willing to do business with the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.<br>After all, he knew very well that if one were to do business with the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted, one must fulfill one&rsquo;s obligation. Otherwise&hellip; the consequences would be disastrous.<br>However, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted had clearly failed to carry out his mission this time around. Naturally, Tuoba Chengan would not be willing to act according to their agreement, and pay him the promised rewards.<br>If he were to do that, he would definitely be severely punished by their sectmaster.<br>However, judging by the situation before him, it seemed like he had no other choice.<br>He could only choose to pay the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted and do what he demanded. Otherwise&hellip; they might all end up dying there.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted burst into sudden laughter.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, this Exalted has always been one to abide by my commitments.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This Exalted had said that if I failed to retrieve the treasures, I will not take your rewards.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Elders, it is this Exalted&rsquo;s fault for being unable to retrieve the treasures for you all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, this Exalted will not make the same mistake next time. Thus, if you need my services again, feel free to contact me.&rdquo;<br>Whilst laughing heartily, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted entered his strange war chariot.<br>&ldquo;Clink, clink, clink~~~&rdquo;<br>As the bell sounded, the war chariot soon disappeared into the distance...<br>The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted had left...<br>However, Tuoba Chengan and the others still stood there completely stunned.<br>The scene from earlier was simply too terrifying. They had really thought that they would be killed.<br>Fortunately, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was an honest person. Otherwise&hellip; they would have suffered disastrously.<br>&ldquo;Lord Supreme Elder, that Asura and the Mystic Cave Saints have disappeared,&rdquo; an elder said all of a sudden.<br>Turning around, Tuoba Chengan and the others discovered that, sure enough, Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints had disappeared.<br>It was unknown where they'd went.<br>&ldquo;Damn it! They made fools of us just like this!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Supreme Elder, what should we do now?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Must we give them the treasures of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb just like that?&rdquo;<br>The elders of the All-heaven Sect were felt extremely unreconciled.<br>After all, they&rsquo;d truly placed great hopes on the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb.<br>They believed that everything inside the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb should belong to them.<br>If their treasures were snatched by someone else, they would truly feel enormous pain.<br>&ldquo;What else can we do? Could it be that you all have some sort of bright idea?&rdquo; asked Tuoba Chengan.<br>Hearing those words, the elders all became quiet.<br>Indeed, they had no choice. After all, not even the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was a match for Asura in the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb. Thus, how could they possibly do anything?<br>&ldquo;For a nobleman to take revenge, ten years is not too long. In the future&hellip; there&rsquo;ll be enough time for them to suffer.&rdquo;<br>Tuoba Chengan let out a cold snort. Then, he waved his sleeve, turned around and began to leave.<br>Although he had said those words very easily, everyone could tell that he was more furious than any of them.<br>After all, what they&rsquo;d lost were the treasures of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb that they&rsquo;d coveted for many years.<br>They&rsquo;d truly suffered disastrous losses!!!<br></p></div>
