        <h1>Chapter 4228</h1>
        <div> - Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As all the powers that were gathered there were very powerful, and even world spiritists that would rarely show themselves were also gathered there, many cultivators went as far as to travel to that lower realm all so that they could see those grand existences.<br>They had no intentions of fighting for the treasure inside the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain. They&rsquo;d come merely to witness those grand existences or enjoy the liveliness.<br>Because of that, that normally desolate world had grown particularly lively because of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain.<br>Countless palaces had been erected from the ground, and powerful cultivators could be seen all throughout the sky.<br>Multiple gigantic war chariots could also be seen floating in midair.<br>As for the number of cultivators that were traveling in the sky, they were simply too many to count.<br>That place had become a flourishing city where countless experts had gathered.<br>However, one thing worthy of mentioning was that the colossuses like the Holy Light Clan and the Dragon Clan did not dispatch anyone.<br>It was a rule that had been established by the Holy Light Clan.<br>They had stated that the inheritance of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain could only be obtained by world spiritists.<br>Martial cultivators, no matter how powerful, were not allowed to participate.<br>If anyone dared disobey the rule, the Holy Light Clan would personally take responsibility to chase after and kill them.<br>This rule had been established so that the world spiritists of the Holy Light Galaxy would have more room to grow and better future prospects.<br>After all, it was a good thing for the Holy Light Galaxy should the Holy Light Galaxy&rsquo;s world spiritists become more powerful.<br>Logically, even if the people from those colossuses&rsquo; did not participate, it was still fine for them to come to watch.<br>But, as expected, the major powers were unwilling to be mere bystanders.<br>Because of that, none of them had come. Even if some of them were present, they were concealed, and would not show themselves.<br>That was how true experts were. They were relatively low-profile and were unwilling to stir up an unnecessary commotion.<br>Even Grandmaster Tang Chen was like that.<br>Because of that, after Grandmaster Tang Chen arrived with Chu Feng, Yu Ting and Yuan Shu, he cast a concealment formation around them. The bystanders present were simply unable to see the four of them.<br>The four of them were currently standing in the sky. They were able to see the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain when they looked down.<br>The Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain was an extremely vast plain.<br>The plain looked very ordinary. Apart from a boundary formed with world spirit techniques, there was nothing else.<br>That boundary did not restrict anyone. It appeared to be nothing more than a symbol.<br>Although there were a lot of experts gathered there at that moment, no one crossed over the boundary to step into the plains.<br>The reason for that was because once they crossed the boundary, they would be inside the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain.<br>Currently, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain still had not revealed itself. No one knew what it would be like once it revealed itself.<br>That was likely the reason why no one dared to approach it.<br>Since Chu Feng had arrived at this place, he would naturally examine it.<br>Unfortunately, even his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes was unable to determine anything.<br>Apart from a rather intense Ancient Era&rsquo;s aura, he was unable to see anything strange from the ground below.<br>&ldquo;Senior, has this place always been like this?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked curiously.<br>Since he was unable to see through the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain, he had no choice but to ask Grandmaster Tang Chen if he wanted to learn more about it.<br>&ldquo;This place was originally like this.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, many years ago, an unforeseen event occurred here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not only was there an abnormal sign that filled the sky, but ancient characters also appeared in the sky.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It was also during that time that the Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain appeared.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It was only because of that, that people learned that this place was actually a place with an inheritance for world spiritists.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Moreover, this place contains the most powerful inheritance found in the entire Holy Light Galaxy,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;Senior, has no one attempted to enter and explore on their own?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>The path of martial cultivation was one filled with dangers.<br>It was common knowledge that riches must be sought from dangers. That was a principle understood by all cultivators.<br>Unless it was known that entering certain places would result in certain death, the great majority of martial cultivators would not cower from danger.<br>Since they knew that there was such a powerful inheritance there, Chu Feng felt that there would most definitely be people that had braved the risk to enter and explore.<br>&ldquo;The abnormal sign that appeared back then had provided us with sufficient instructions.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The instructions had told us when the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain would open.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It also stated that we must not rashly enter into the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain before it opens.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Nevertheless, there will always be individuals that do not fear death. As such, there were indeed many people that refused to listen to the warnings, and stepped into the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, without exception, all those people would immediately exit the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain. Upon exiting, without exception again, they all died.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Whilst the way they died were all different, their deaths were all very miserable. It seemed as if they had all suffered some sort of cruel torture.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, those people had clearly only just stepped into the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain before exiting right after.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That meant that those people had endured unbearable torture in a split second.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Among the dead were even Martial Exalted-level experts.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ever since that occasion, no one has dared to rashly enter the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why.&rdquo;<br>After hearing the explanation from Grandmaster Tang Chen, Chu Feng finally realized why no one was stepping into the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain.<br>Apparently, doing so would be fatal.<br>&ldquo;Ring, ring, ring---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, ringing sounds could be heard.<br>The ringing brought forth an enormous commotion.<br>Countless people soared into the sky. The majority of those people were from the younger generation.<br>They were all flying toward the direction that the ringing had sounded from.<br>Seeing that, curiosity grew in Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart. He also turned his gaze toward the ringing.<br>It was only then that he noticed that there was actually a huge monster slowly approaching from afar.<br>It was a giant beast.<br>The beast&rsquo;s body measured over thirty thousand meters tall and nearly a hundred thousand meters long.<br>It resembled a giant flying mountain as it approached.<br>The beast had a very strange appearance. Its body resembled that of an elephant, but it had eight legs.<br>Due to its enormous size, it was actually not flying in the sky, but rather walking on the ground.<br>Even though it was walking on the ground, the white clouds could only hover beneath its body.<br>The giant beast was simply too enormous!<br>When looking at the beast from above, it looked as if it was flying. It was only when looking at it from below that one would discover that it was actually walking on the ground.<br>Strangely, even though the beast was so enormous, its footsteps did not cause any vibration on the ground. In fact, no sound could be heard from its footsteps.<br>It was instead the countless wind chimes that were placed around its body that rang nonstop as it moved.<br>Chu Feng and the others only had noticed the approaching giant beast after they heard the ringing sounds.<br>That said, what brought Chu Feng the greatest surprise was the fact that the giant beast was not a living creature.<br>Instead, it was composed of wood and metal.<br>It seemed more like a peculiarly-shaped mobile palace.<br>Nevertheless, one could tell using one&rsquo;s naked eyes how marvelous of an object the giant beast was. From that, one could also tell that its master was most definitely extraordinary.<br>&ldquo;So that old codger also came.&rdquo;<br>Seeing the giant creature, Grandmaster Tang Chen spoke with a faint smile.<br></p></div>
