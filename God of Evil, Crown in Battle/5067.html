        <h1>Chapter 5066</h1>
        <div>: Struggling In Despair<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No cultivator would devote so much time and effort to mastering a single weapon, especially not a junior. A cultivator&rsquo;s comprehension ability tended to be the strongest in their younger years, allowing them to further their cultivation at a rapid pace.<br>With each advancement in cultivation rank, there would be new martial skills to learn. Even trying to grasp these new martial skills was a challenge in itself, so it made little sense for a junior cultivator to squander their time on mastering a single weapon.<br>Yet, Jiang Yuantai happened to be an odd one out.<br>Shoosh shoosh shoosh!<br>Deafening winds raged around Chu Feng like a furious storm, each of them accompanied with a single spear piercing toward him.<br>There was only a single spear in Jiang Yuantai&rsquo;s hands, but it was all he needed to draw on the might of tens of thousands of soldiers to tightly encircle Chu Feng. Chu Feng was already using his full strength at this point, but he was still struggling to deal with Jiang Yuantai&rsquo;s offense.<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t know that Jiang Yuantai&rsquo;s offense wasn&rsquo;t any simple attack. This was a spear formation created through the third level of the Three Souls Conqueror Spearmanship!<br>Jiang Yuantai pushed on with his ferocious offense, but to his astonishment, he was still unable to breach Chu Feng&rsquo;s defense. Slowly, those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect began to lose their composure.<br>Under normal circumstances, Jiang Yuantai should have clinched victory by now after bringing forth the full prowess of the Three Souls Conqueror Spearmanship, but somehow, the spear formation wasn&rsquo;t able to get to Chu Feng despite the relentless assault.<br>&ldquo;Could it be that Chu Feng is well-versed in swordsmanship?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not right. Chu Feng is putting up a strong defense, but there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any pattern to it. He seems to be doing it instinctively.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How is Chu Feng able to react that quickly? Is he a prodigy greater than our two young masters?&rdquo;<br>Jiang Taibai had been watching the duel too. As a Half-God level cultivator, he was able to clearly see Chu Feng and Jiang Yuantai&rsquo;s movements as if they were both moving in slow motion. For that reason, he could tell just how formidable Chu Feng was.<br>&ldquo;Young master Yuantai, you should end the battle as quickly as possible,&rdquo; Jiang Taibai told Jiang Yuantai via voice transmission.<br>Jiang Taibai realized that even though Chu Feng initially struggled to deal with Jiang Yuantai&rsquo;s offense, his movements were slowly growing more fluid. This was a sign that Chu Feng was accustoming himself to Jiang Yuantai&rsquo;s offense. At this rate, it was only a matter of time before he breached Jiang Yuantai&rsquo;s spear formation.<br>As much as Jiang Yuantai didn&rsquo;t want to accept it, Chu Feng was indeed a prodigy. On top of that, he possessed great combat experience that few in the older generation could match.<br>Even without Jiang Taibai&rsquo;s reminder, Jiang Yuantai had also realized how serious the situation had become. In truth, he was already going all out, but he still couldn&rsquo;t overcome Chu Feng&rsquo;s defense.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo;<br>Jiang Yuantai&rsquo;s eyes narrowed viciously.<br>His spearmanship grew even faster and stronger. His spear formation also increased in prowess, unleashing a relentless barrage of pierces toward Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Damn it, he has been hiding his true strength!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had barely gotten accustomed to Jiang Yuantai&rsquo;s offense when the latter&rsquo;s attacks suddenly grew explosively stronger. That threw Chu Feng off the loop, forcing him to defend in a fluster.<br>This time around, he wasn&rsquo;t able to maintain his perfect defense anymore. Jiang Yuantai&rsquo;s spear started brushing across his body while he was dodging. Within moments, he had already been inflicted with multiple bloodied lacerations. None of these injuries were fatal, but they were glaring enough to make one feel queasy.<br>It was not that Chu Feng was weak but that Jiang Yuantai had suddenly become too strong.<br>Even so, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t lose his composure. With focused eyes, he gathered all of his attention and did his best to defend himself against Jiang Yuantai. He knew that it was even more so at times like this that he had to give his all.<br>There might still be a chance of survival if he gritted his teeth and held on. Otherwise, everything would really be over.<br>But it was simply too difficult. Jiang Yuantai&rsquo;s strikes were so heavy that only someone of Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength could barely receive them, and his attacks were so quick that Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t even follow them at all. Chu Feng could only count on his own senses and combat experience to predict Jiang Yuantai&rsquo;s attacks.<br>It was only a matter of time before Chu Feng would fall in defeat at this rate, but this was already the limit of what he could do without resorting to martial skills, secret techniques, and other means.<br>&ldquo;Am I destined to lose here? No, I can&rsquo;t lose. I must win this fight!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt deeply indignant. The overwhelming emotions welling up inside him forced him to become more focused than ever, and all of the fighting he had been through over the years flashed across his head.<br>&ldquo;If my current means aren&rsquo;t enough to defeat him, all I have to do is to create a means that would allow it!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes suddenly began shining brightly. He began to study Jiang Yuantai&rsquo;s movements intently while blocking the latter&rsquo;s attacks. At the same time, his brain also started processing at an increased speed.<br>Such a state naturally resulted in a fall in Chu Feng&rsquo;s defensive prowess, resulting in him accruing injuries. Despite this, his eyes became even sharper. His determination to defeat Jiang Yuantai burned even more intensely than ever.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Jiang Yuantai sneered coldly when he saw how Chu Feng&rsquo;s movements had become dulled. Oblivious to the truth, a relieved smile emerged on his lips. He thought that his victory was guaranteed now that Chu Feng was at his limit.<br>&ldquo;Master, what do we do?&rdquo;<br>Watching the growing number of injuries on Chu Feng&rsquo;s body, Wang Yuxian turned to look at the Lady of Dao Sea with pleading eyes.<br>&ldquo;Lele, Chu Feng only has himself to count on right now,&rdquo; the Lady of Dao Sea replied helplessly.<br>She wanted to help Chu Feng too, but there was nothing she could do. They were completely at the mercy of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. If she intervenes in the duel, Chu Feng would be immediately deemed as the loser and all of them would be killed.<br>Shoosh shoosh shoosh!<br>All of a sudden, Chu Feng suddenly switched from defense to offense and pushed his sword toward Jiang Yuantai. It was such an abrupt attack that Jiang Yuantai was forced to retreat. Had he not reacted in time, his spear formation might have collapsed to the attack.<br></p></div>
