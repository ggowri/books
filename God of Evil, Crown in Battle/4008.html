        <h1>Chapter 4007</h1>
        <div> - Being Refused<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;I am different from you,&rdquo; Zhao Hong said to the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;Heh. Back then, the severity of the injuries we suffered were the same. And now, our cultivations are also the same. This means that both you and I suffered the same adverse effects from the battle. What difference is there?&rdquo; asked the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>Even though he was saying those words, his expression had changed.<br>He had a feeling that what he did not wish to happen might&rsquo;ve happened.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re already an old man now. The reason why your cultivation hasn&rsquo;t made any progress is due to the limits of your talent.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This will be as far as you can go in your lifetime.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, it is different for me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been reborn through reincarnation. The current me is a person of the younger generation,&rdquo; said Zhao Hong.<br>&ldquo;Reborn through reincarnation?&rdquo;<br>The crowd&rsquo;s expressions all changed upon hearing those words.<br>They all knew that Zhao Hong&rsquo;s age should be around that of the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>Although the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster appeared to be rather young, and only looked like a middle-aged man; he was actually an old monster that had lived for thousands of years.<br>Younger generation? That was an age that he and Zhao Hong had long surpassed.<br>Yet, Zhao Hong had said that she had been reborn through reincarnation as a person of the younger generation?<br>This caused the crowd to feel great disbelief.<br>&ldquo;Reborn through reincarnation?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That sort of thing goes against the natural order. It&rsquo;s impossible for such a thing to happen.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That was something that you told me personally. Unless&hellip;&rdquo;<br>As he said those words, the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster looked to Zhao Hong again. His gaze had become exceptionally gloomy and cold, &ldquo;...unless you were lying to me then.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t lie to you then. It is indeed impossible to be reborn through reincarnation with only the power of the Reincarnation Pearl.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However&hellip;&rdquo;<br>As she spoke up to that point, Zhao Hong&rsquo;s gaze changed.<br>&ldquo;...it&rsquo;s not something that you need to know anymore.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>After she finished saying those words, Zhao Hong&rsquo;s gaze shifted. She turned into a flash of light and shot straight towards the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;Demoness, the only reason why I didn&rsquo;t kill you back then was because I was lenient. Today, I shall eliminate you completely.&rdquo;<br>Facing the rank four Utmost Exalted-level Zhao Hong, the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster was not at all afraid. He raised his All-heaven Dragon Sword and rushed forward to confront her.<br>&ldquo;Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom~~~&rdquo;<br>In the blink of an eye, the two had collided in battle.<br>Their weapons crisscrossed and their oppressive mights wreaked havoc everywhere. Their battle even caused the sky to change color.<br>The battle between two rank four Utmost Exalted had surpassed the crowd&rsquo;s imagination.<br>The great majority of the crowd were unable to make out the details of the battle. They could only sense terrifying martial power devastating their surroundings.<br>Likely, amongst all the crowd present, only the leaders of the five great powers would be able to clearly witness the battle between Zhao Hong and the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>Even Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints were unable to make it out.<br>Even though Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints were able to see the other side through the spirit formation gate, the spirit formation gate was more like a mirror.<br>When the energy ripples filled the air and covered everything, Zhao Hong and the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster&rsquo;s figures had long disappeared.<br>Because of the fact that the spirit formation gate was like a mirror, even though Chu Feng was a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, he was still unable to utilize his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes to see through them.<br>They could only see the image that might appear on the spirit formation gate.<br>With the situation at hand like being like that, Chu Feng became very worried and restless.<br>After all, that was Zhao Hong, Wang Qiang&rsquo;s lover and his close friend.<br>Chu Feng had gone through many life and death situations with her.<br>Even ignoring the relationship between her and Wang Qiang, she was still a very good friend of his.<br>Ever since he had left the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, Chu Feng had been concerned about Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang.<br>Now that he had found Zhao Hong only to see her confront such dangers, it was only natural for Chu Feng to worry.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, why are you so tense?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, don&rsquo;t be afraid. The distance between them and us is very far away. No matter how intense their battle might be, they will not affect us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let us enjoy the show.&rdquo;<br>Due to being excessively worried for Zhao Hong, Chu Feng&rsquo;s worry and restlessness were vivid on his face.<br>Even the Mystic Cave Saints were able to tell how tense he was.<br>Not knowing why Chu Feng was so tense, they decided to joke around with him.<br>Feeling heavy-hearted, Chu Feng was in no mood to bother with the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>Even though they were clearly unable to see what was happening through the spirit formation gate, his gaze was still fixed onto it.<br>Suddenly, the spirit formation gate started to distort.<br>This brought immediate panic to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Is this spirit formation gate about to close?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, we have activated this spirit formation gate by using a material from the Ancient Era.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That material is a consumable. Once it&rsquo;s consumed, the spirit formation gate will disappear on its own.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Judging from the appearance of things, it will not be able to last much longer,&rdquo; said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng said to the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints, &ldquo;I have a presumptuous request.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I deeply hope that you will help me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In the future, I will return this favor with treasures many times greater in value.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, what do you need our help with?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do you need something from us? If you need anything, go ahead and speak away. As long as it&rsquo;s something we can give you, there&rsquo;s simply no need for you to repay us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right, right, right. We&rsquo;re brothers. If you need anything, don&rsquo;t hesitate to tell us. No need to bother with repaying us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is you who saved our lives. What could we refuse to give you? You&rsquo;re considering us outsiders too much by speaking that way.&rdquo;<br>Once Chu Feng spoke, all the Mystic Cave Saints began to express their attitude.<br>They were stating that they would give Chu Feng whatever he needed for free.<br>&ldquo;May I borrow that golden humanoid capable of increasing one&rsquo;s cultivation?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are you referring to this?&rdquo;<br>The Eldest of the Mystic Cae Saints extended his hand into his dantian and took out an item.<br>That item was composed of golden gases. It resembled a little golden person.<br>That little golden person appeared very extraordinary.<br>It seemed to possess life. There was a great amount of power contained within its tiny body.<br>That was Utmost Exalted-level martial power.<br>That item was originally something the Mystic Cave Saints had prepared for the unexpected.<br>They had prepared it because they were afraid that Chu Feng would not be able to smoothly enter the spirit formation gate to escape.<br>That little golden person was capable of forcibly increasing one&rsquo;s cultivation. However, it was akin to a forbidden medicine, and the user would suffer an extremely intense backlash after using it.<br>&ldquo;Right, that&rsquo;s it. Can I borrow it?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Whilst it&rsquo;s fine for you to have it, what do you need it for?&rdquo; asked the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, that thing is extremely dangerous,&rdquo; said Eleventh.<br>&ldquo;I will be frank with everyone. That Reincarnation Sect&rsquo;s Zhao Hong is an old friend of mine.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Now that the situation of the battle is uncertain, I am very worried for her.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I want to go and aid her,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, if that&rsquo;s the case, I&rsquo;m afraid I cannot help you.&rdquo;<br>However, after hearing Chu Feng, the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints immediately put the little golden person away.<br>&ldquo;What are you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt completely lost upon seeing that.<br>Seeing the perplexed Chu Feng, the Mystic Cave Saints spoke in succession.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, you don&rsquo;t know how powerful that thing is.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if it&rsquo;s an Utmost Exalted using it, they could very possibly die still.&rdquo;<br>"Although you&rsquo;re a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist and possess Utmost Exalted-level battle power, it is only your spirit power that&rsquo;s strong. Your physical body and soul are still only that of an Exalted.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Regardless of whether it might be your body or your soul, neither will be able to bear that thing&rsquo;s power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you are to use it, you will undoubtedly die.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right, right, right. We&rsquo;re doing this for you.&rdquo;<br>They did not care about the relationship between Zhao Hong and Chu Feng at all.<br>They also did not care about whether Zhao Hong lived or died.<br>They only cared about Chu Feng&rsquo;s safety.<br>Knowing full well how powerful that item was, they would naturally not allow him to take on such risks.<br></p></div>
