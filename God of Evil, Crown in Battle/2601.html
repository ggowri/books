        <div> - Chu Feng&rsquo;s Decision<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, rather than relying on someone else, it is better to rely on yourself. At times like this, you need to rely on yourself,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen advised Chu Feng in a very serious manner.<br>As for Chu Feng, he was deep in thought.<br>It was the same for Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi. Both of them were pondering deeply. They wanted to find out exactly what had gone wrong.<br>&hellip;...<br>After some time passed, Ying Mingchao suddenly raised his head. His gaze had changed. He seemed to have thought of something. He turned to Zi Xunyi and asked, &ldquo;Xunyi, how are Chu Feng&rsquo;s injuries compared to how our injuries were back then?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Back then, we could be considered to have been on the verge of dying.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although Chu Feng&rsquo;s current situation is very serious too, there&rsquo;s still an enormous difference in seriousness compared to how we were back then,&rdquo; Zi Xunyi said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, I should be right then. Chu Feng&rsquo;s injuries are not serious enough,&rdquo; Ying Mingchao said.<br>&ldquo;Are you perhaps planning to suggest that Chu Feng walk through those slaughtering formations again?&rdquo; Zi Xunyi asked.<br>&ldquo;Everything else is correct. The only difference is his degree of injury. Apart from this, I cannot think of any other method,&rdquo; Ying Mingchao said.<br>At this moment, Zi Xunyi grew silent. She was also unable to think of a way to break through the Life and Death Formation.<br>Right at this moment, Chu Feng suddenly stood up. He said, &ldquo;Senior, I&rsquo;ve thought of a way.&rdquo;<br>At the practically the same moment when Chu Feng spoke, Ying Mingchao also said, &ldquo;Chu Feng, I&rsquo;ve managed to think of what the problem is.&rdquo;<br>The crowd were all startled by Chu Feng and Ying Mingchao speaking simultaneously. It was as if they had managed to see hope in Chu Feng passing through the Life and Death Formation.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;ve also thought of it?&rdquo; Hearing what Chu Feng said, Ying Mingchao felt extremely happy.<br>After all, he felt very apologetic to have Chu Feng endure the torment again. To be honest, he didn&rsquo;t really want to tell Chu Feng to do it.<br>If Chu Feng had also thought of the same thing as he did, things would be much easier.<br>&ldquo;I think that I should still rely on what I&rsquo;ve comprehended from the illusion to break through this formation,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;<br>Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s heart tensed up the moment he heard what Chu Feng said. This was completely different than what he had thought.<br>Although Ying Mingchao approved of Chu Feng&rsquo;s decision, he still asked, &ldquo;Chu Feng, why do you say that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, I feel that illusion might not necessarily be trying to misguide us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason for that is because on my way here, I grew more certain that the method to break through the formation that I&rsquo;ve comprehended from the illusion is feasible,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, not mentioning whether what you&rsquo;ve comprehended from the illusion is feasible or not, with your current state, you will simply not be able to use the method that you&rsquo;ve comprehended from the illusion,&rdquo; Ying Mingchao said.<br>&ldquo;Senior, there is a method that might be able to allow me to recover,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;To recover?&rdquo; Ying Mingchao was very astonished.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a spirit formation that I&rsquo;ve comprehended from the illusion. That spirit formation will be able to help me recover. Merely&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng did not finish his words. The reason for that was because while that spirit formation might be able to allow him to make a recovery and completely cure him of his injuries, returning him to his optimal state, it might also end up taking his life.<br>This was a gamble.<br>However, Chu Feng had a fifty percent chance of being able to completely recover his injuries.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking about that healing formation?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No, you must not. That formation is too dangerous. It will be one thing if you are able to succeed. However, if you are to fail, it will take your life,&rdquo; Ying Mingchao said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you must trust me. Both Xunyi and I have been to the Unknown Burial Ground. We have both experienced what you&rsquo;ve experienced.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We would never lie to you. We have also attempted many of the spirit formations from the illusion. However, the result was that we nearly lost our lives in the process. Chu Feng, you must not make rash decisions,&rdquo; Ying Mingchao advised Chu Feng earnestly.<br>&ldquo;Senior, have you tried that healing formation before?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I have not. The reason for that is because that spirit formation is simply too dangerous,&rdquo; Ying Mingchao said.<br>&ldquo;Senior, earlier, you said that you knew what the issue is?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>He wanted to know what Ying Mingchao had discovered the issue to be.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, I&rsquo;ve found it&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Ying Mingchao hesitated no more. He directly mentioned to Chu Feng what he felt the issue to be.<br>&ldquo;What? He wants you to endure the torment from the slaughtering formations again?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Tell him to drop dead!&rdquo;<br>After hearing Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s proposal, before Chu Feng could respond, Her Lady Queen exploded.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you must absolutely not listen to him. He is not you. What he did then might not necessarily be the same as what you&rsquo;ve done. I feel that he only managed to break through this Life and Death Formation by blind luck.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if you&rsquo;re planning to gamble, you must do it according to your own thoughts. You cannot gamble with what he thinks to be right.&rdquo;<br>Her Lady Queen was afraid that Chu Feng would continue to listen to Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s instructions. Thus, she began to advise Chu Feng against it repeatedly.<br>At this moment, Chu Feng grew completely silent.<br>He was hesitating.<br>At the beginning, he felt great amount of certainty and trust toward Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s words. That was why he did as Ying Mingchao instructed without the slightest hesitation and renounced the method to break through this Life and Death Formation that he had formulated himself.<br>However, he was now no longer that certain.<br>On the way here, he grew more and more certain that the method to break through this Life and Death Formation that he had comprehended from the illusion was the actual way out, whereas the method proposed by Ying Mingchao resembled more of a gamble.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, Lord City master will not deliberately harm you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You are still very young. Thus, you do not know about how dangerous that Unknown Burial Ground is. All these years, practically no one was able to come out from the Unknown Burial Ground alive. Lord City Master and Senior Zi are the only two individuals that ever managed to come out alive.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that Chu Feng was hesitating, many people present began to urge Chu Feng. They wanted him to trust Ying Mingchao.<br>Their actions were understandable. After all, the Unknown Burial Ground was an extremely dangerous place. As such, they would automatically believe that the experience from the sole survivors was undoubtedly correct.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, don&rsquo;t bother with their nonsense. You are different from them. Just because they cannot accomplish it does not mean that you also will not be able to accomplish it either.&rdquo;<br>At this moment, her Lady Queen began to strongly urge Chu Feng against listening to Ying Mingchao.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve decided,&rdquo; Finally, Chu Feng spoke.<br>&ldquo;I know very well that Senior Ying and Senior Zi will not try to harm me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However I, Chu Feng, have my own idea. Furthermore, the person that is being trapped in the Unknown Burial Ground right now is me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, I wish to use my own method to break through this formation,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young Hero Chu Feng, you must definitely not be stubborn and make rash decisions. This is something that concerns your life.&rdquo;<br>After hearing what Chu Feng said, the crowd grew silent for a moment. However, they soon burst into an uproar.<br>&ldquo;Quiet!&rdquo; Right at this moment, Ying Mingchao shouted loudly.<br>The crowd immediately closed their mouths and stopped talking.<br>At this moment, Ying Mingchao had a very complicated expression. Likely, he was feeling very tangled in his heart too.<br>However, in the end, he said to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Chu Feng, since you&rsquo;ve decided, you should do what you think is correct.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Mingchao, you can&rsquo;t allow Chu Feng to do that,&rdquo; Seeing that Ying Mingchao had given his consent, Zi Xunyi immediately grew nervous.<br>&ldquo;Xunyi, can we guarantee that Chu Feng will definitely be able to escape from there if he is to use our method?&rdquo; Ying Mingchao asked.<br>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Zi Xunyi did not answer. She didn&rsquo;t know how to answer.<br>&ldquo;At the beginning, I was certain that was the case. However, I am now no longer certain. Thus, we should allow Chu Feng to make his own decision. After all, the person this decision concerns is Chu Feng himself,&rdquo; Ying Mingchao said.<br>&ldquo;Thank you senior. In that case, this junior will begin.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he sat cross-legged on the ground. Spirit power began to emerge from his body. He was setting up a spirit formation.<br>That spirit formation was actually very simple. However, as Chu Feng was suffering from very serious injuries all over, even his spirit power had grown much weaker than before. Thus, it took Chu Feng an entire hour to set up the spirit formation.<br>This spirit formation was a tunnel. There were two doors. One was the entrance, and the other was the exit.<br>Seeing this spirit formation, Chu Feng sucked in a mouthful of cold air.<br>This spirit formation was something that he had managed to comprehend from the illusions.<br>This was a spirit formation that he could only set up in the Unknown Burial Ground.<br>As Chu Feng looked to this spirit formation that held a fifty-fifty chance of life and death, he had no idea what would happen after entering it.<br>However, Chu Feng still, before the crowd&rsquo;s fixed focus, dragged his seriously-injured body into the spirit formation.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Once Chu Feng entered the spirit formation, that spirit formation immediately started to shine with light. However, that light was crimson in color. It was the same color as blood.<br>In fact, strange sounds were heard from within the spirit formation.<br>Those sounds seemed to be the sound of chewing.<br>It was chewing Chu Feng.<br>At this moment, the people present became extremely worried for Chu Feng.<br>They all did not know whether or not Chu Feng would be able to walk out of that strange spirit formation alive after entering it.<br><br></p></div>
