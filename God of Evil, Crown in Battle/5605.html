        <h1>Chapter 5605: Qin Hang’s Challenge</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Nine Realms Immortal Region had confirmed that the Ancestral Martial entrance was the first one to be opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Is it the feat of the earlier young man?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s impossible. Even if he entered the premises, there&rsquo;s no way he could have opened it that quickly.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who didn&rsquo;t know better initially suspected Chu Feng due to how easily he had </span><span>killed a rank one Half-God level cultivator earlier. However, the crowd swiftly realized that they were only surprised by Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength because he was from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. There were plenty of prodigies</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>who were capable of the same feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no reason Chu Feng could have opened the Ancestral Martial entrance so fast, especially when he had arrived late. The thought of that was simply too implausible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng, Long Xiaoxiao, and Shengguang Xuanye were taken aback too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a person appeared behind Long Xiaoxiao.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Ningyu Shangren, Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s master. She didn&rsquo;t conceal her aura at all, perhaps because she was aware of Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s history with Shengguang Xuanye. It was hard to properly gauge her current cultivation level, but the pressure from a True God level cultivator still left Shengguang Xuanye feeling suffocated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a Half-God level cultivator was like a god to him, let alone a True God level cultivator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Milord, that matter was caused by me. It has nothing to do with them!&rdquo; Shengguang Xuanye quickly took the blame, thinking that Ningyu Shangren was here to teach Chu Feng a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao called out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shengguang Xuanye was startled. He didn&rsquo;t think that someone that powerful would actually be Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Xiaoxiao, young friend Chu Feng, you should head into the Ancestral Martial entrance now that it&rsquo;s opened, lest you become disadvantaged in the remannt,&rdquo; Ningyu Shangren said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those words affirmed her relationship with Long Xiaoxiao while hinting at her high favorability toward Chu Feng. Shengguang Xuanye was left with mixed feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a True God level cultivator was willing to nurture Long Xiaoxiao, but he was so narrow-minded as to want to destroy the two of them back then. The difference in their attitudes left him feeling deeply ashamed of himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Chu Feng and Long Xiaoxiao were about to make their way toward the Nine Realms Immortal Region, the remaining seven entrances, including the Nine Souls entrance, suddenly opened at the same time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if the most talented prodigies from the eight galaxies were gathered here, it shouldn&rsquo;t have been possible for all eight entrances to open at the same time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the crowd was trying to figure out the situation, the earlier baritone voice echoed once more, &ldquo;The earlier challenger has broken the record for the trial, so the Nine Realms Immortal Region shall be opened with the highest level. All eight entrances shall be opened!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng&rsquo;s curiosity was piqued, and the crowd began fervently discussing the matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;All eight doors are opening at once? Such a feat has never been accomplished by even the prodigies in the earlier years of the current era, but someone actually pulled it off. Who in the world could it be?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on the discussions, Chu Feng figured out that this was one of the rules of the Nine Realms Immortal Region. Any challenger who broke the record of the Nine Realms Immortal Region would be able to activate the highest level of the Nine Realms Immortal Region, entitling them to the best tempering. However, the remaining seven entrances would open as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This rule was thought to be a myth. Even in the earlier years of the current era, when there was no lack of talented cultivators, there was not a single junior who accomplished this feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, it looks like things have gotten more interesting,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Indeed. Let&rsquo;s go and see who&rsquo;s the one behind this,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he entered the Nine Realms Immortal Region through the Ancestral Martial entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Long Xiaoxiao and Ningyu Shangren made their way over too. Now that the entrances were all open, even elders like Ningyu Shangren were able to enter the Nine Realms Immortal Region too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon passing through the entrance, Chu Feng found himself in a long corridor. He sensed bundles of teleportation energy continuously gathering around him, and each of them eventually manifested into a person. There were more elders than juniors among the people transported into this corridor</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was rushing into the Nine Realms Immortal Region now that all eight entrances had opened, but much to his surprise, neither Long Xiaoxiao nor Ningyu Shangren, despite having entered the same entrance as him, was with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would appear that those who entered the gates were transported to random locations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without any hesitation, Chu Feng began making his way deeper into the corridor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a bundle of teleportation energy gathered in front of Chu Feng, and it manifested into a familiar face&mdash; Qin Hang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng. You&rsquo;re here too?&rdquo; Qin Hang looked at Chu Feng in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Someone accomplished the tremendous feat of opening all eight entrances, allowing everyone to enter the Nine Realms Immortal Region,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Qin Hang scanned the surroundings, and he quickly confirmed that Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t lying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That explains why I was brought here while breaching the formation. Tsk! I thought that I succeeded, but it seems like someone beat me to it,&rdquo; Qin Hang cursed in frustration. He turned to Chu Feng and asked, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the one who broke the record?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s fine as long as it isn&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; Qin Hang remarked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng was rendered speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Does Qin Hang really see me as his love rival, as to be so concerned with my result?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not wanting to bother Qin Hang, he started to head deeper into the corridor as he said, &ldquo;I wish you all the best in here.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Wait a moment.&rdquo; Qin Hang suddenly stopped Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He threw out a treasure, and the treasure transformed into a barrier around him and Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could tell that Qin Hang had created a barrier around them because he didn&rsquo;t want anyone to overhear what he was going to say next. It was unlikely that Qin Hang was being aggressive here since he couldn&rsquo;t sense any killing intent from the other party.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a rank three Half-God level cultivator, right?&rdquo; Qin Hang asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Are you fond of Xiaoxiao?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;This doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with you, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; Qin Hang burst into laughter. &ldquo;Of course it has something to do with me. Xiaoxiao is my future bride. Don&rsquo;t worry, Chu Feng. I won&rsquo;t hurt you; you are Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s benefactor, after all. However, I still have to clear all hindrances along the way. I need to make sure you understand that you aren&rsquo;t worthy of Xiaoxiao. You should have somewhat realized that even before my appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It just so happens that I&rsquo;m at rank three Half-God level too, so why don&rsquo;t we have a fight between men? The one who loses shall back out of the race and never trouble Xiaoxiao ever again!&rdquo; Qin Hang said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Of course. I should let you know that I, Qin Hang, am no pushover. I shall show you what I&rsquo;m capable of!&rdquo; Qin Hang said as his aura surged. His cultivation raised from rank three Half-God level to rank five Half-God level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Qin Hang was indeed formidable, being able to raise his cultivation by two ranks at his current cultivation level. However, he was clearly lacking compared to Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, Chu Feng asked, &ldquo;Is this the limit of what you&rsquo;re capable of?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Qin Hang was confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng suddenly took a step forward, and he appeared right before Qin Hang the next instant. Before Qin Hang could snap out of it, Chu Feng was already pressing a formation sword against his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Qin Hang&rsquo;s complexion turned awful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Y-you aren&rsquo;t just a rank three Half-God level cultivator? You&rsquo;re a Gold Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist on top of that!&rdquo; Qin Hang&rsquo;s eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Do you admit defeat?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t cave in for Xiaoxiao!&rdquo; Qin Hang exclaimed as he brought out an Exalted Armament spear with a flick of his wrist. His fighting prowess instantaneously rose by leaps and bounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng stowed away his sword before twisting his body to unleash a swift roundhouse kick, but his target wasn&rsquo;t Qin Hang but his spear. It was such a fast kick that Qin Hang only felt a numbing sensation in his right hand when his spear flew out of his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Qin Hang was stunned. He thought that he still stood a chance against Chu Feng since Gold Dragon World Spiritists were comparable to rank five Half-God level cultivators.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Chu Feng&rsquo;s kick shattered his hopes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that he couldn&rsquo;t defeat the fellow before him. Even though Chu Feng was a Gold Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, his fighting prowess was comparable to a </span><span>rank six Half-God level cultivator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, when Qin Hang looked at Chu Feng once more, he had already lost all interest in fighting the latter. His lips quivered, then he burst out crying.</span></p></div>
