        <h1>Chapter 3766</h1>
        <div> - Strange Poison<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say this man is not your grandson? If that&rsquo;s the case, why are you panicking?&rdquo; asked Gu Mingyuan.<br>&ldquo;Even if he&rsquo;s not my grandson, that&rsquo;s still a life we&rsquo;re talking about here. If you want to punish anyone, you can punish me. Why would you torture the innocent?&rdquo; said the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>&ldquo;Torture the innocent? Someone like you actually said those words?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Gu Mingyuan revealed a look of anger. Evidently, she was enraged by what the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master said.<br>After she finished saying those words...<br>A layer of power was released from her palm and instantly enveloped that crazed man.<br>&ldquo;Eeeahh~~~&rdquo;<br>In the next instant, the crazed man began to scream miserably.<br>He was suffering intense pain and screaming as if he would rather be dead.<br>An existence like Gu Mingyuan could make that crazed man vanish with a simple wave of her hand.<br>Torturing him was simply a trifling matter.<br>&ldquo;Stop! Stop!!!&rdquo;<br>Seeing the pained appearance of the crazed man, the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master began to shout himself hoarse.<br>Not only that, but his face was covered with anger, pain, and other complicated emotions.<br>As matters stood, it was obvious to everyone that the crazed man was the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s grandson. Otherwise, he wouldn&rsquo;t possibly care about him so much.<br>However, to the crowd&rsquo;s confusion, even though the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master was concerned about his grandson, even though he was watching his grandson being tortured right before him, he was still unwilling to reveal who the mastermind that ordered him to kill Chu Feng was.<br>&ldquo;Senior, it&rsquo;s enough.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng extended his hand and grabbed Gu Mingyuan&rsquo;s hand.<br>Chu Feng was able to see the determination of the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master. Even if Gu Mingyuan tortured the crazed man dead, the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master would still not mention who the mastermind was.<br>Although he was unable to understand why the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master was so reluctant to reveal that person, so much so that he was willing to disregard the life of his grandson, Chu Feng knew that nothing would come of it even if they continued to torture the crazed man.<br>Even killing the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master would only serve to vent one&rsquo;s anger. That was not the result that Chu Feng wanted.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you might still not know exactly how many innocent people were killed by the Blood-devouring Hall.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s simply no need for you to be merciful towards someone like him," Gu Mingyuan said after seeing that Chu Feng was trying to stop her.<br>&ldquo;Senior, whilst it is true that the people of the Blood-devouring Hall all deserve to die, he is still innocent of their crimes.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng looked at the crazed man as he said those words.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo; Gu Mingyuan sighed. &ldquo;Forget it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is a matter of your Chu Heavenly Clan to begin with. You can handle it however you wish.&rdquo;<br>Gu Mingyuan not only felt helpless upon hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words, but she was also slightly angry. After saying those words, she walked out.<br>&ldquo;Senior, you all should leave too,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Grandmaster Liangqiu, Chu Xuanzhengfa and the others.<br>Grandmaster Liangqiu and others were very tactful. After Chu Feng asked them to leave, they all walked out.<br>At that moment, the crazed man once again ran over to the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master, who was still tied up, and grabbed him tightly.<br>Although he was mentally handicapped, he still recognized the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master to be his grandfather.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, thank you.&rdquo;<br>Surprisingly, the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master actually thanked Chu Feng with a look of gratitude on his face.<br>&ldquo;Thus, you&rsquo;ve finally admitted that he is your grandson?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Correct. He is indeed my grandson.&rdquo;<br>The Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master knew that he was no longer able to conceal this matter. Furthermore, there was no need for him to do so.<br>&ldquo;I am very confused. Who exactly could the mastermind be to be able to make you guard your mouth so well?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What I am unable to understand even more is that even if you don't wish to reveal who the mastermind is, you can very well give a random name. There's no need for you to be so insistent no?&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>Hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words, the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master revealed a wry smile.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, perhaps you will not believe me. Whilst it is true that I&rsquo;ve done all sorts of evil and should be someone without any baseline, I am actually someone who has a baseline.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Never in my life have I lied or deceived anyone.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You can say that I am guilty of monstrous crimes and extreme evil, but I am most definitely not a despicable and vile character.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Actually, it would be one thing if the person that wanted to kill you was someone else. However, he is my benefactor. He has saved my life. Even if I am to renounce my own life, I still cannot betray him.&rdquo;<br>The Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master had an emotional look on his face as he said those words. Chu Feng felt that he was not lying.<br>&ldquo;I can tell that you care about that benefactor of yours greatly. However, you should also think about your grandson.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you reveal who that benefactor of yours is, I will let you and your grandson go. Otherwise, your grandson will continue to remain here and accompany you,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, it wouldn&rsquo;t be bad either.&rdquo;<br>Surprisingly, the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master actually smiled at Chu Feng&rsquo;s words.<br>He was not smiling out of mockery. Instead, he was smiling in satisfaction. It was as if being imprisoned was the kind of life he wanted.<br>&ldquo;Whilst you are capable of allowing yourself to be imprisoned for the rest of your life, what about your grandson? Are you planning to have him pay for your crimes too?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>Hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words, the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master was suddenly stunned. He then looked at his grandson, who was tightly hugging him and weeping nonstop. Then, the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master revealed a complicated emotion in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Think it over.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You can talk when you feel like talking.&rdquo;<br>After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng turned around and prepared to leave.<br>&ldquo;Wuuahh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s grandson grabbed his head with both hands, fell to the ground and began to roll around whilst screaming in pain.<br>Seeing that, Chu Feng immediately turned around and released his spirit power to treat him.<br>However, after treating his condition for a while, Chu Feng discovered that the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s grandson&rsquo;s pain was unrelated to the torture from Gu Mingyuan earlier.<br>Instead, there was a substance in his head. It was a black liquid.<br>That black liquid was very strange. It seemed to be alive. That black liquid had already assimilated with the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s grandson&rsquo;s soul, and it was that black liquid that was causing such enormous pain to him.<br>In fact, Chu Feng felt that it was possible that the reason why the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s grandson was mentally handicapped was also related to that black liquid.<br>&ldquo;Your grandson has been poisoned, did you know that?&rdquo; Chu Feng raised his head and looked at the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>The Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master sighed helplessly.<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s my grandson, how could I not know he was poisoned?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s nothing that can be done. I&rsquo;ve tried all sorts of methods. None of them were able to remove the poison.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I had sought a master world spiritist in another starfield and asked him to use spirit formations to restrict the poison so that my grandson would not have to suffer its torture.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Originally, he had been living peacefully all these years. Likely, Gu Mingyuan destroyed the spirit formation when she attacked him earlier. That&rsquo;s why he is suffering from the poison again," said the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>&ldquo;That poison is indeed very difficult to remove. However, if it&rsquo;s restricting it, I am able to give it a try,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re willing to help him?&rdquo; Hearing those words, the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s expression changed.<br>Chu Feng ignored him. He sat down cross-legged and released his spirit power to envelop the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s grandson.<br>Chu Feng began treating the grandson of the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>Seeing that, the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master revealed a complicated gaze.<br>The poison his grandson was inflicted with was no small matter. Back then, he had paid quite a high price in order to have that master world spiritist help him.<br>The reason for that was because one would have to pay a certain price in order to subdue that poison.<br>No one would be willing to help for free.<br>As a world spiritist, Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t possibly not know about that. Yet, he was still willing to help him. In fact, he did not hesitate at all. This surprised and, to a greater extent, moved the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br></p></div>
