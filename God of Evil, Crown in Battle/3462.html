        <h1>Chapter 3461</h1>
        <div> - Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;What is going on here?&rdquo;<br>When those crimson words appeared, shock filled everyone&rsquo;s eyes.<br>Evidently, that message was aimed at Chu Feng.<br>But&hellip; the curse of the Black-feathered Specter was clearly that of the Tantai Heavenly Clan. Why would it be targeting Chu Feng?<br>&ldquo;Senior, I truly have no idea what is going on here. This is definitely not forged by our clan. You&rsquo;re a Saint-cloak World Spiritist, you would be able to examine things. There is simply no one in our clan that&rsquo;s capable of doing such a thing.&rdquo;<br>Tantai Xing&rsquo;er became increasingly nervous. After all, the matter was simply too strange. In such a situation, people would only suspect that it was caused by their Tantai Heavenly Clan.<br>As such, she had to emphasize that they had no hand in it whatsoever or else it would be very difficult for their Tantai Heavenly Clan to explain it.<br>&ldquo;This really does not seem to be something that the Tantai Heavenly Clansmen could accomplish,&rdquo; Wuming Xingyun said after inspecting the room.<br>&ldquo;But, even if the curse has reappeared, it shouldn&rsquo;t have landed on Chu Feng. After all, Chu Feng has only just entered the Tantai Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie said.<br>&ldquo;Judging from the current situation, someone has most likely pretended to be the Black-feathered Specter and used its identity to kidnap Miss Liluo, in order to threaten young friend Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if that person is young friend Chu Feng&rsquo;s enemy, they would most likely not threaten him in such a manner.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As such, this matter is truly fishy,&rdquo; Wuming Xingyun sighed.<br>Chu Feng naturally wanted to figure out what was going on with such a fishy matter.<br>Thus, he continued to search for clues. However, in the end, he was unable to find anything at all. He simply had no idea who had kidnapped Bai Liluo, or where she had been taken to.<br>&ldquo;I truly wonder who it is that&rsquo;s playing this joke on me,&rdquo; Chu Feng suddenly smiled.<br>His smile was a very helpless smile. As matters stood, he was practically certain that the so-called Black-feathered Specter was not the actual Black-feathered Specter. Likely, someone was pretending to be the Black-feathered Specter.<br>But, to be able to leave behind such a black feather and disguise oneself so well that even Wuming Xingyun was unable to find any mistakes, this was enough to prove how powerful the culprit was.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what are you planning to do now?&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie asked.<br>&ldquo;As matters stand, it would appear that I have no choice but to compete in the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars. I hope that person will be able to keep their promise,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Hearing those words, both Wuming Xingyun and Wuma Shengjie heaved a sigh of relief.<br>They were originally worried that Bai Liluo&rsquo;s disappearance would end up affecting Chu Feng. However, judging from the situation at that moment, their worries were needless. Chu Feng had still decided to participate in the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars.<br>Furthermore, he would definitely try his very best in the selection.<br>As for that entire situation, it was because of the crimson words left behind by that black feather.<br>After all, those crimson words had clearly stated that Chu Feng would only be able to see Bai Liluo again should he obtain first place in the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars.<br>Bai Liluo&rsquo;s safety would definitely be an enormous motivator for Chu Feng. Thus, he would definitely put forth all his effort, and disregard his own safety, to obtain first place.<br>Thus, at that moment, Wuming Xingyun, Wuma Shengjie and even Tantai Xing&rsquo;er were all wondering if the person who had pretended to be the Black-feathered Specter was a friend or foe to Chu Feng.<br>After all, that threat to Chu Feng did not cause any harm to him, but instead gave him motivation.<br>After making his decision, Chu Feng wanted to directly leave the Tantai Heavenly Clan and proceed for the place where the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars would be held.<br>However, Tantai Xing&rsquo;er urged Chu Feng to stay and investigate the matter of the Black-feathered Specter with her. On the one hand, it would cleanse suspicion from their Tantai Heavenly Clan. On the other hand, she wanted to accompany Chu Feng.<br>Beside Tantai Xing&rsquo;er, Wuming Xingyun also urged Chu Feng to stay. He too wanted to accompany him. Ultimately, Chu Feng decided to stay.<br>What Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t know was that Wuming Xingyun had written a secret letter after he confirmed that Chu Feng was going to participate in the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars.<br>Although the Starfield Master Realm would not participate in the selection of the Ancestral Martial Decastars, they were the ones conducting the selection.<br>Thus, the Starfield Master Realm most definitely possessed great authority over the grand occasion that concerned the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>&hellip;...<br>Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound!<br>This was a place located in the central region of the Nine Dragons Upper Realm.<br>The Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound was not an ordinary location. That place was directly connected to the deep underground abyss of the Nine Dragons Upper Realm. The underground abyss contained the legendary Nine Dragons Aura, something extremely extraordinary.<br>Reportedly, the renowned Nine Dragons Saint Cloak was created by the legendary World Spiritist Immortal King using the Nine Dragons Aura.<br>Although the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound was very famous, no one was able to enter the depths of the Nine Dragons Upper Realm from there.<br>As such, the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound was not a forbidden area. It was also completely unguarded. Generally, apart from curious people, very few people would go there.<br>However, that had changed in recent days.<br>Not only was the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound sealed off by a powerful spirit formation, its surroundings were also packed with people. Silhouettes could be seen in both the sky and on the ground.<br>Furthermore, a lot of those people were individuals with extraordinary identities.<br>From their outfits and the title plates on their waists, one could determine that many of the people gathered there were not from the Nine Dragons Upper Realm. In fact, many of them were the overlords of other Upper Realms.<br>Occasionally, one would even be able to see extremely renowned people among the crowd.<br>The reason why so many grand characters were gathered there was because it was the place that the Starfield Master Realm chose to hold the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars.<br>Judging from the number of days passed, the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars would soon begin. Thus, many people had arrived early, so they could obtain good spots to watch the selection.<br>After all, everyone knew that the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars could easily be said to be the most marvelous showdown between the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>No one was willing to miss out on such a grand occasion.<br></p></div>
