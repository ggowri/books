        <div> - Incomplete Imperial Armament<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I heard that you, by yourself, managed to completely absorb all of the energies in the Immortal Cultivation Lake in a matter of several hours?&rdquo; The Weaponry Refinement Immortal looked to Chu Feng with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;Senior, such a thing did happen. However, I did not accomplish that by myself. That day, there were many people training in the Immortal Cultivation Lake. Everyone managed to obtain benefits from it,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Even with that many people, it would be impossible for them to completely absorb all of the energies in my Immortal Cultivation Lake in such a short period of time. That Immortal Cultivation Lake is something that I personally refined. Thus, I know best what it is capable of.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Boy, you truly make one have a whole new level of respect for you. It is no wonder that those two girls, Zi Ling and Su Rou, are so hell-bent on you. Boy, like Xinghe, you also possess the potential to become an overlord,&rdquo; The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said.<br>&ldquo;Senior, you are flattering me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said. Then, he asked, &ldquo;Senior, may I know how long Zi Ling and Su Rou are going to stay here to train?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You do not have to worry about that. The two of them will be absolutely safe here. No one will be able to harm them. Furthermore, even if they are to leave here, I will let them leave with my name. How many people in the entire Holy Land of Martialism would possibly dare to touch my, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal&rsquo;s, people?&rdquo; The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, senior, for your troubles,&rdquo; Chu Feng was grateful from the bottom of his heart.<br>&ldquo;Boy, you shouldn&rsquo;t be thinking about others right now. Instead, you should be thinking about yourself. This here is the armament that I&rsquo;ve refined for you. See if it&rsquo;s fitting.&rdquo; As the Weaponry Refinement Immortal spoke, he took out a Cosmos Sack from his waist and threw it to Chu Feng.<br>After opening the Cosmos Sack, Chu Feng discovered that contained within the Cosmos Sack was actually a pair of boots. It was a pair of very ordinary-looking boots. They were more or less the same as the ones that Chu Feng was wearing on his feet right now.<br>The boots were not very elegant or beautiful, nor were they decorated gorgeously. In fact, they could even be said to be plain and simple. However, when Chu Feng held the pair of boots in his hands, he immediately knew that they were an extraordinary treasure.<br>Incomplete Imperial Armament. This pair of boots was an Incomplete Imperial Armament. Unlike Chu Feng&rsquo;s Infinity Edge, this pair of boots was not a copy. Rather, it was a real Incomplete Imperial Armament.<br>However, this Incomplete Imperial Armament was not one that needed to recognize its master. Rather, it had been tailor-made for Chu Feng. In other words, other than Chu Feng, no other person could use this pair of boots.<br>&ldquo;Thank you senior,&rdquo; Chu Feng expressed his thanks by cupping his fist respectfully. He was extremely happy. That was because it was only at this moment that he knew what was meant by a tailor-made item.<br>&ldquo;Do not be so anxious to thank me. Try them on first.&rdquo; As the Weaponry Refinement Immortal said those words, he stood up, pushed the door to the thatched hut open, and walked out. Then, he said, &ldquo;The house is too small, there&rsquo;s not enough space to test them out. Come, test the boots outside.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Mn.&rdquo; Chu Feng arrived outside of the house. He removed the boots that he was wearing and then put on the Weaponry Refinement Immortal&rsquo;s tailor-made boots.<br>&ldquo;Senior, there&rsquo;s no need to test. This pair of boots is a treasure indeed. They are capable of increasing my speed by an entire tier.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With junior&rsquo;s real strength, rank five Half Martial Emperors would not be able to contend against me at all. Even against rank six Half Martial Emperors, I could fight one with difficulty. However, I will definitely be no match for rank seven Half Martial Emperors.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, with this pair of boots, even if I cannot win against rank seven Half Martial Emperors, I will be able to win against rank seven Half Martial Emperors in terms of speed. Even though this pair of boots would not be able to help me with anything else other than speed, it would be able to help me when my life is in danger, and I need to escape. It is an outstanding artifact for escaping,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Not bad. You have skills. You actually managed to determine the value of this pair of boots using only perception.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, Chu Feng, that is not all this pair of boots is capable of. I have also refined ten talismans for you. As long as you use the talismans on the boots, your speed will be able to increase once again. At that time, no one underneath the Martial Emperor realm will be able to catch up to you,&rdquo; As the Weaponry Refinement Immortal spoke, he took out ten talismans and handed them to Chu Feng.<br>Without even receiving the talismans, Chu Feng was able to tell how powerful they were using merely his eyes. Those talismans must have cost the Weaponry Refinement Immortal a long time to refine. That was because those talismans were too powerful, they were simply priceless treasures.<br>&ldquo;Senior, your enormous grace and kindness toward Chu Feng is something that Chu Feng cannot repay. However, if there ever comes a day that Chu Feng can repay you, this junior will definitely repay you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said while clasping his fist.<br>&ldquo;My, what sorts of words are those? I held this Weaponry Bestowment Assembly for the purpose of finding outstanding members of the younger generation like yourself, so that I could bestow weapons to them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You have passed my trials. Thus, it is only natural that I bestow you a weapon. This is something that you deserve. There is no need for you to be this courteous.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, that said, Chu Feng, you must be on guard against others. To travel by yourself, you must be extra careful.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even though we have not known each other for long, I can tell that you are a talent. Thus, I do not wish for your life to be lost at the hands of vile individuals,&rdquo; The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, senior, for your warning. This junior will definitely pay attention,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Mn, you can return. You&rsquo;ll be leaving tomorrow. Return early and rest yourself,&rdquo; The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, junior shall take his leave,&rdquo; After Chu Feng bid his farewell, he returned directly to his residence. The Weaponry Refinement Immortal had spoken his intentions clearly. Furthermore, he had also bestowed Chu Feng and the others their promised weapons. Thus, Chu Feng and the others would not be able to continue staying on the Immortal Island. The Weaponry Bestowment Assembly was going to end. Tomorrow, regardless of whether one wished to leave or not, they were all required to leave.<br>Upon thinking of the fact that he would be leaving, Chu Feng was feeling a bit reluctant to leave. The reason for that was because of his two lovers, Zi Ling and Su Rou.<br>However, before Chu Feng even arrived at his residence, he was suddenly overjoyed. His footsteps also accelerated. Upon reaching his residence, he immediately pushed open the door.<br>&ldquo;Zi Ling, Su Rou, the two of you are really here!&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng saw the two beauties, one wearing a purple skirt and the other wearing a blue skirt, one pure and sweet and the other mature and charming, he became overjoyed.<br>At this moment, he finally realized why the Weaponry Refinement Immortal had told him to return early. It was evident that the appearance of Zi Ling and Su Rou was not a coincidence. Likely, they had come here because the Weaponry Refinement Immortal had arranged it.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re truly amazing. You actually managed to make the Weaponry Refinement Immortal appreciate you like this. He even especially told the two of us to accompany you before you leave,&rdquo; Zi Ling and Su Rou spoke together. The two of them had smiles across their faces. It was clear that they were extremely happy to see Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Accompany me? The two of you aren&rsquo;t leaving tonight?&rdquo; Chu Feng grabbed the two girls and spoke with a beaming smile.<br>Hearing those words, Zi Ling and Su Rou blushed. However, in the end, the two of them nodded silently.<br>&ldquo;Haha, this is truly great!&rdquo; At this moment, Chu Feng was in immense joy. His impression of the Weaponry Refinement Immortal had changed, he now had a much more favorable impression of the Weaponry Refinement Immortal.<br>That was because he had discovered that this Weaponry Refinement Immortal was a person who was extremely good at understanding others.<br>&ldquo;Eh, strange, the two of you managed to break through? You two actually reached a breakthrough this quickly? Amazing.&rdquo; Suddenly, Chu Feng discovered that Zi Ling&rsquo;s cultivation was now rank three Half Martial Emperor, and Su Rou&rsquo;s cultivation was now rank two Half Martial Emperor. The two of them had both reached a breakthrough. Furthermore, it didn&rsquo;t seem like they had only broken through today. Likely, they had reached their breakthroughs several days ago. This speed was even faster than he had predicted it would be.<br>&ldquo;How could we compare to you? Not only did you break through, you even completely absorbed all of the energies in the Immortal Cultivation Lake,&rdquo; Su Rou said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;You knew?&rdquo; Chu Feng found it a bit embarrassing.<br>&ldquo;Of course. Not only do we know that you dried up the entire Immortal Cultivation Lake, we also know that you made Beitang Zimo suffer enormously, making him slap himself ten times on the spot. He truly and utterly disgraced himself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;When we first heard this news, both big sis Su Rou and I were overjoyed. For him to provoke you, this is the consequence of his action. Serves him right!&rdquo; Zi Ling said with a pleased tone.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only you who&rsquo;s overjoyed, no? I&rsquo;ve already gotten used to this. Ever since Chu Feng obtained a small reputation for himself in the Azure Dragon School, there has never been anyone who could bully him. It has always been him bullying others,&rdquo; Su Rou said.<br>&ldquo;My two darlings, please stop making cutting remarks about me. To not see you two for so many days, do you two know how much I missed you?&rdquo; As Chu Feng spoke, he suddenly waved his sleeve and set up a spirit formation that sealed off this house. Then, he carried both Zi Ling and Su Rou onto the bed.<br>This day, Zi Ling and Su Rou did not leave Chu Feng&rsquo;s residence. Even when night came, they were still there. This night, Chu Feng slept extremely well. He was able to spend the night accompanied by his two lovers. To the current Chu Feng, this was truly a dream come true.<br></p></div>
