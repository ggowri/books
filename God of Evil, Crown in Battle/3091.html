        <div> - Returning To The Lower Realm<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s voice was heard. After finding out about the truth, she was not as undisturbed and calm like Chu Feng. Instead, Her Lady Queen became very angry. &ldquo;Pah! Lot of thoughts my ass! He is simply heartless!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although your mother also did not look after you, she at least sealed this Queen in your body. As for your father, he truly pushed you into dangers with no regard. If it wasn&rsquo;t for your own capabilities, you might really be dead already.&rdquo;<br>She sighed. &ldquo;Men. Sometimes they are truly frighteningly selfish.&rdquo;<br>Hearing Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s angry voice, Chu Feng chuckled lightly.<br>He knew very well that Her Lady Queen was only so angry because she felt sorry for him.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still laughing? Your father deceived you!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, even if he had no way to keep you by his side, you would&rsquo;ve been able to have this old man raising you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet, your father decided to toss you into that Ancestral Martial Lower Realm and have you grow up by yourself. How could you still laugh at that?&rdquo; Hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s laughter, Her Lady Queen became even more furious.<br>&ldquo;Eggy, it&rsquo;s enough. Aren&rsquo;t I perfectly fine?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t harbor hard feelings for your future father-in-law just because of that,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;What did you say? Future father-in-law?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The hell do you mean by future father-in-law?&rdquo; Hearing those words, Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s little face immediately changed.<br>&ldquo;Since you&rsquo;re going to be my future wife, my father will naturally be your future father-in-law,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a mischievous laugh.<br>&ldquo;Pah! You are truly daring! You dare to take advantage of this Queen! How shameless could you be?!&rdquo; Her Lady Queen spoke very angrily.<br>&ldquo;My Eggy, stop pretending. I know that you have fallen deeply in love with me. You&rsquo;re not planning to marry anyone besides me, no?&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Heavens, how did you become this shameless?! If I knew you would become like this, this Queen would not have protected you till this day!&rdquo; Her Lady Queen shouted with contempt.<br>Whilst Chu Feng and Her Lady Queen were conversing with one another inside Chu Feng&rsquo;s mind, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief suddenly opened his mouth.<br>He said, &ldquo;Chu Feng, regarding the truth of what happened back then, only you, your father and I know about it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You absolutely must not speak of this matter to anyone else, not even Chu Xuanzhengfa.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Otherwise, if word of this matter is to spread, it will not only bring danger to your father, but our entire Chu Heavenly Clan will likely face a calamity of death and destruction.&rdquo;<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had a very serious expression on his face as he said those words.<br>&ldquo;Senior, please rest assured. As this matter concerns the safety of our Chu Heavenly Clan, this junior will definitely keep it confidential.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng knew that there were a lot of reasons as to why his father was forced to make such a decision back then.<br>Powerful enemies were not scary. Instead, it was the internal traitors that were scariest. Even for the Chu Heavenly Clan now, they were filled with internal and external conflicts, and were not united at all.<br>A lot of people hoped for the death of Chu Feng and his father. Naturally, Chu Feng would not tell the actual truth.<br>As for Chu Xuanzhengfa, Chu Feng firmly believed in his character. Chu Feng believed that the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief said those words not because he suspected Chu Xuanzhengfa's character, but rather because he felt that it was safer to keep the matter as confidential as possible.<br>"That said, senior, there is something that this junior wishes to seek your help with."<br>"What is it?" The Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief asked.<br>"I wish to take a trip back to the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm," Chu Feng said.<br>Although Chu Feng's strength could be considered to be extremely strong among all of the Ancestral Martial Starfield's younger generations, returning to the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm was still not something that he could decide on his own. He had to first get permission from the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>"Actually, this old man knew that you wanted to return. As such, that will naturally not be an issue. Our Chu Heavenly Clan has a formation that leads directly to the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm. You can also use that formation to directly return to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm."<br>"That said, there are still things that this old man must warn you of," At that moment, the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief's expression turned serious again.<br>"Senior, please speak away," Chu Feng said.<br>"With your cultivation, you will be akin to an actual god should you return to the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm. You will be able to travel completely unhindered through its vast territory. You will be able to easily destroy numerous formations. However... there are still places that you cannot enter," The Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief said.<br>"Where?" Chu Feng asked.<br>"The Misty Peak," The Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief said.<br>"The Misty Peak?" When he heard that name, Chu Feng started to recall the numerous rumors and legends regarding the Misty Peak.<br>The Misty Peak was indeed a miraculous land. Existing on it were many unexplainable powers. Even Ya Fei, Ya Ruyu, and Murong Wan had disappeared in there.<br>"Located in the Misty Peak is a power far superior to that of our clan. I know that you have some relationship with the people of the Misty Peak. However, that Misty Peak is a mystery that not even our Chu Heavenly Clan is capable of solving."<br>"Our clan has always felt that the Misty Peak might be the hiding ground of a certain Ancient Era's Organism. Thus, it is best to not enter deep into the Misty Peak. Otherwise, if you end up disturbing that individual, a great catastrophe will be imminent, and no one will be able to save you," The Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief warned.<br>"Exactly what happened in the Ancient Era? Why would there be Ancient Era's Organisms still alive, but the Ancient Era's cultivators are nowhere to be seen?" Chu Feng asked curiously.<br>"Who said that there aren't any Ancient Era's cultivators still alive today?" The Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief asked with a smile on his face.<br>"There are martial cultivators from the Ancient Era still alive today?" Chu Feng asked feeling very surprised.<br>Regardless of how powerful a martial cultivator might be, they would inevitably be limited by their lifespan. However, this was different for some special organisms. Their lifespans were far longer than those of human cultivators. Thus, it was understandable for them to still be alive.<br>However, if martial cultivators were able to continue to live on from the Ancient Era till present, it would be very astonishing. Unless one were using some sort of heaven-defying method, it would be impossible for a martial cultivator to live for so long.<br>Most importantly, Chu Feng had seen Ancient Era&rsquo;s Organisms. However, he had never seen any Ancient Era&rsquo;s cultivators. Curious as to what actually happened in the Ancient Era, Chu Feng hoped that there would be Ancient Era&rsquo;s cultivators still alive. Should that be the case, the mystery of the Ancient Era would be solved.<br>&ldquo;Many years ago, when your grandfather and I were still young, a martial cultivator emitting an ancient era&rsquo;s aura all over his body was discovered in a remnant somewhere in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Merely, he seemed to have received an enormous shock, and was delirious when he was discovered, killing anyone he encountered.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He was so powerful that he was simply unstoppable. Back then, only a small portion among those that encountered him were able to survive. The great majority of them died by his hands.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Afterwards, he was seen in multiple other places. A bloodbath ended up happening in all the places that he appeared.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Originally, everyone felt that he would become a catastrophe of our Ancestral Martial Starfield. Fortunately, he ended up leaving the Ancestral Martial Starfield. Only then did the uneasy and alarmed people of the Ancestral Martial Starfield ease their hearts,&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s actually such a thing?&rdquo; Chu Feng started to feel a faint sense of unease after hearing about it.<br>&ldquo;As such, it might be possible that there are still cultivators from the Ancient Era that are alive. As for that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Organism that I spoke of, it might not necessarily be a monster. It is possible that it is a human cultivator. Merely, discovering it might not necessarily be a good thing,&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;I am truly growing ever more curious as to exactly what happened in the Ancient Era,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;The mystery will one day be solved. Perhaps our cultivation is still insufficient. Likely, this old man will have no chance to find out about the mystery of the Ancient Era. However, it is different for you,&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said as he looked to Chu Feng.<br>Then, he asked, &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right. Chu Feng, when do you plan to return to the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm to see your father?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, I am planning to set off immediately,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;This urgent?&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief smiled. Then, he said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good too. Well then, follow me.&rdquo;<br>Afterwards, Chu Feng followed the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and arrived at a building. It was a vast palace hall emitting an extremely ancient aura.<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief brought Chu Feng to a gate. Upon opening the gate, Chu Feng could see that there was a formation inside.<br>Seeing that formation flickering with light, Chu Feng became very excited.<br>Chu Feng knew that he would leave the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm and return to the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm the moment he stepped into that formation.<br>The people that had helped him in the past, the people that had battled alongside him, the people that Chu Feng considered to be his relatives&hellip; Chu Feng had always thought about them ever since he left.<br>Finally, Chu Feng was able to return to see them again, return to chat and drink with them again.<br></p></div>
