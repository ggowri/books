        <h1>Chapter 4226</h1>
        <div> - Scared Witless<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whilst it was only oppressive might, it was an extremely powerful oppressive might.<br>This oppressive might contained devastating power capable of destroying heaven and earth. Everywhere it passed, space crumbled and was reduced to primal chaos.<br>But, even though the powerful oppressive might had swept past the three mysterious individuals, it didn't move them in the slightest. Not only were they uninjured, they weren't affected at all.<br>Seeing that, the All-seeing Heavenly Master&rsquo;s complexion turned green, and the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted&rsquo;s expression turned ugly.<br>Even though they'd known from the very start that those people weren't simple, the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted had only realized at that moment that he had still underestimated them.<br>The young man among the three spoke again, &ldquo;Old fart, I&rsquo;ve come to find the All-seeing Heavenly Master. You shouldn&rsquo;t get in the way.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Scram from my sight. Else, do not blame me for becoming impolite.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted had been planning to pull back the moment he realized that his oppressive might had failed to harm those three.<br>However, never would he have imagined the man would be so arrogant. His tone was no longer just simply disregarding his existence. It was simply intolerable to the arrogant and aloof Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted, who was revered by everyone.<br>&ldquo;Ignorant youngster. I do not know who you are.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, with how you&rsquo;re lacking in manners, this old man must teach you a lesson today.&rdquo;<br>As the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted spoke, his world spiritist gown began to flutter as dazzling light began to pour from his body.<br>It was spirit power.<br>Accompanying the spirit power was a powerful oppressive might.<br>It was an oppressive might far superior to that of a rank one Martial Exalted.<br>It was an oppressive might on par with that of a rank three Martial Exalted.<br>However, it was clearly spirit power, not martial power.<br>The All-seeing Heavenly Master was immediately overjoyed the moment she felt how powerful the spirit power was.<br>There could only be a single possible justification for her master&rsquo;s spirit power being so powerful!<br>&ldquo;Master, congratulations on your successful breakthrough to rank six Dragon Transformation Sensation.&rdquo;<br>The All-seeing Heavenly Master was so overjoyed that she half-knelt on the ground and bowed respectfully to congratulate her master.<br>Her master&rsquo;s world spirit techniques were already the strongest in the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>Her master was the person who possessed the greatest chance at obtaining the inheritance of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain.<br>Now that her master had grasped rank six Dragon Transformation Sensation and had obtained a battle power on par with rank three Martial Exalteds, who could possibly contend against him?<br>Should the news spread, her master&rsquo;s status would increase again. No one would be able to threaten his status.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that you&rsquo;re planning to refuse the face that is being given to you.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a voice sounded. It was the young man.<br>Once the words left his mouth, the All-seeing Heavenly Master felt the sudden appearance of a destructive aura.<br>Before she could even clearly see what that was, a muffled explosion was heard.<br>When she reacted to what had happened, the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted who had been standing beside her had disappeared.<br>She turned around and looked to the stone gate, and saw that the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted had fallen deep into the palace hall. Like mud, he was stuck to the wall.<br>The Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted had been mutilated beyond recognition. Even his aura had become extremely weak. He simply resembled someone who was on the verge of death, and was surviving by a single breath.<br>&ldquo;Master!&rdquo;<br>The All-seeing Heavenly Master immediately got up after seeing his condition. She wanted to rush to her master to treat his injuries.<br>&ldquo;Halt.&rdquo;<br>But, a voice sounded from behind her.<br>Once she heard the voice, the All-seeing Heavenly Master did not dare take another step.<br>Not only that, but her body began shivering. Her hair stood on end as a chill emerged from within her and filled her entire body.<br>It was the young man&rsquo;s voice again.<br>Merely, the voice sounded like a call from the devil to the All-seeing Heavenly Master. It was a voice that sounded like death itself.<br>Her master had grasped rank six Dragon Transformation Sensation, which had not only greatly increased his world spirit techniques, it had also given him a battle power on par with rank three Martial Exalted.<br>How powerful of an existence was rank three Martial Exalted?<br>However, even though her master was that powerful, he had been beaten to such a state by the young man.<br>She hadn&rsquo;t even been able to see his attack. Even her master hadn't been able to let out a single scream before being beaten unconscious.<br>At the instant when the man attacked, she felt an aura so terrifying that it was simply something that she had never felt before.<br>The All-seeing Heavenly Master turned around and immediately knelt.<br>At that moment, she did not even dare to raise her head.<br>&ldquo;Milord, I was blind. Milord, I hope that you can spare my life.&rdquo;<br>The All-seeing Heavenly Master&rsquo;s voice trembled uncontrollably.<br>&ldquo;All-seeing Heavenly Master, you don&rsquo;t have to be afraid.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I told you that I came here to find you because I need your help, not because I want your life,&rdquo; said the young man.<br>&ldquo;Milord, what is it that you need my help with? Please tell me,&rdquo; said the All-seeing Heavenly Master.<br>&ldquo;Please help prophesy this for me. If I forcibly open this item, what will happen?&rdquo;<br>As the young man spoke, an item floated out and slowly floated over to the All-seeing Heavenly Master.<br>After seeing the item, the All-seeing Heavenly Master was so terrified that she nearly fainted.<br>It was a black case emitting an Ancient Era&rsquo;s aura.<br>The All-seeing Heavenly Master had recognized the case.<br>It was something that belonged to the Holy Light Clan.<br>When the Holy Light Clan had obtained the case, they had asked her master to help them open it.<br>She had also accompanied her master.<br>She had already made a prophecy about the case back then.<br>Because of that, the Holy Light Clan already knew that the case could not be opened, and would not seek her out to ask about it again.<br>Although the Holy Light Clan was extremely powerful, they wouldn&rsquo;t look down on her master in such a manner.<br>All of this indicated one thing.<br>Although the three mysterious individuals had a treasure of the Holy Light Clan in their possession, they were most definitely not from the Holy Light Clan.<br>It was very possible that the three of them had stolen the treasure from the Holy Light Clan.<br>&ldquo;Milord, I am able to perform a prophecy on this for you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, if I do, I hope that Milord can keep this matter confidential. If word of this matter is to spread, I&rsquo;m afraid I will have to fear for my life.&rdquo;<br>The renowned All-seeing Heavenly Master actually teared up as she spoke.<br>No matter how renowned she might be, no matter how powerful she was, she was still only human.<br>Faced with such a powerful existence, faced with such a dangerous situation, she found it extremely difficult to maintain her composure.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured. I will keep this matter confidential for you.&rdquo;<br>As the young man spoke, he bent his back.<br>The distance between him and the All-seeing Heavenly Master grew even closer. But, the light emitting from his body also grew even more dazzling. The All-seeing Heavenly Master could not see his appearance, and also did not dare to look. Extremely terrified, she lowered her body even more.<br>The young man&rsquo;s voice sounded again.<br>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right. You&rsquo;d best not lie to me. Otherwise, I&rsquo;ll make you even more miserable than your master.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t dare. I wouldn&rsquo;t dare,&rdquo; the All-seeing Heavenly Master shook her head repeatedly.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. You can begin.&rdquo;<br>How could the All-seeing Heavenly Master dare hesitate after hearing those words?<br>She immediately began her ceremony to prophecy the outcome of a forced opening of the case.<br>The outcome of her prophecy was the same as the previous one.<br>&ldquo;Milord, I&rsquo;ve actually made a prophecy about this case before.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I am unable to prophesy exactly what is hidden in this case.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, I am able to prophesy the outcome of a forced opening of the case.<br>&ldquo;The outcome of my prophecy this time is exactly the same as last time,&rdquo; said the All-seeing Heavenly Master.<br>&ldquo;Enough with the superfluous words. Tell me what the outcome of the prophecy is,&rdquo; said the young man.<br>The All-seeing Heavenly Master did not dare deceive the young man. As such, she informed him of the outcome of her prophecy honestly.<br>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the case. Thanks.&rdquo;<br>After learning the outcome of the prophecy, the three of them put away the case and left.<br>Just as they'd come, they had disappeared without any sign, and had left no trace of their existence.<br>Just as they had appeared out of thin air, they disappeared into thin air.<br>After they disappeared, the All-seeing Heavenly Master fell powerlessly to the ground.<br>She was completely terrified, and did not even have the strength to crawl back up. She felt as if her body was no longer under her control.<br>&ldquo;Has our Holy Light Galaxy been invaded by experts from other galaxies?&rdquo; the All-seeing Heavenly Master gasped after a long time had passed.<br>She felt that there was no one in the Holy Light Galaxy that could snatch away a treasure from the Holy Light Clan.<br>Since no one in the Holy Light Galaxy was capable of it, it would mean that they were most definitely experts from another galaxy!<br></p></div>
