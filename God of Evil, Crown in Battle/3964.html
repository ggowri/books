        <h1>Chapter 3963</h1>
        <div> - Five Weapons<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Wang Chen?&rdquo;<br>Compared to the bystanders&rsquo; surprise, the disciples from the Wind Lightning Sword Sect were completely flabbergasted.<br>After all, Chu Feng&rsquo;s appearance was that of their fellow disciple, Wang Chen.<br>Even though they knew that Wang Chen was an arrogant fellow, they also knew that he was someone who feared the strong, and would only bully the weak.<br>Before the weak, Wang Chen was akin to a king.<br>Before the strong, Wang Chen was nothing more than a coward.<br>Furthermore, in their current setting, Wang Chen was one of the relatively weaker people amongst the one hundred disciples of the Wind Lightning Sword Sect.<br>Normally, even towards those hundred fellow disciples, Wang Chen was someone who would consider things before speaking. He was someone who would not dare to provoke any of them.<br>Thus, why would he suddenly dare to go against the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s strongest disciple, Song Jinglun?<br>Furthermore, what Wang Chen had said just then was not only going against Song Jinglun, but he was simply disregarding all of the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain and Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s disciples, including even the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s strongest, Ouyang Pingzhi.<br>Such behavior was simply too daring.<br>&ldquo;Ouyang Pingzhi, never would I have imagined you to be this useless.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even your junior brother is looking down on you in such a manner.&rdquo;<br>Song Jinglun looked to Ouyang Pingzhi with a mocking expression.<br>As for Ouyang Pingzhi, he was simply furious. He felt that being contradicted by his junior brother was more embarrassing than being insulted by Song Jinglun.<br>&ldquo;Wang Chen, all of us are standing in line here. Why are you in such a rush?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Did you think you&rsquo;re the only one in a rush to enter?&rdquo;<br>Although Ouyang Pingzhi spoke with a very displeased voice, his words could still be considered to be courteous.<br>The reason for his behavior was because there were many grand existences present, and he had to keep up his elegant demeanor.<br>However, Chu Feng did not concern himself with the act that Ouyang Pingzhi put up. He chuckled and said, &ldquo;Are you blind or what?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;<br>Ouyang Pingzhi and the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s disciples simply did not dare to believe their ears.<br>Wang Chen actually dared to continue to contradict Ouyang Pingzhi?<br>Furthermore, his words were so unpleasant to hear.<br>Did he eat a bear&rsquo;s heart and leopard&rsquo;s gall?<br>[1. Eating bear heart and leopard gall are supposed to increase one&rsquo;s courage.]<br>Even Bai Lulu looked at Chu Feng with an expression of surprise in her eyes.<br>&ldquo;Raise your head and look at the mirror image in the sky.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The disciples from the All-heaven Sect and Dragon Phoenix Immortal Pavilion have all entered the spirit formation world.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for you, you actually have the time to continue spouting bullshit here?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s any conflict, move aside and settle it on your own. Don&rsquo;t occupy the shitter but refuse to shit, don&rsquo;t stand there and not walk in.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;While you might not be in a rush, I am.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t come here to see you all quarrel. I&rsquo;m here to obtain the treasure in that spirit formation world.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I am to miss out on the decisive opportunity, are you going to take responsibility for it?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze was burning like a torch. His words were sharp and penetrating.<br>&ldquo;That guy has gone truly mad. He actually dared to speak to Ouyang Pingzhi in such a manner?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, who does he think he is? He actually dared to speak such conceited nonsense of retrieving the treasure in that spirit formation world?&rdquo;<br>The bystanders were all confused as to why that Wang Chen fellow would be so daring.<br>As for the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s disciples, they were even more astonished, so much so that the expressions of many of them had changed.<br>They were even looking at Wang Chen with sympathy in their eyes.<br>They all felt that he was screwed.<br>To dare to contradict Ouyang Pingzhi in such a manner in such a public setting. Wang Chen was most definitely toast.<br>&ldquo;You are truly one that is lacking education. If you want to die, I can very well help you with it.&rdquo;<br>Faced with such an arrogant Chu Feng, Ouyang Pingzhi was finally unable to contain himself. Not only was there an ominous glint in his gaze, but he also began to threaten Chu Feng using voice transmission.<br>&ldquo;Ouyang Pingzhi, what are you doing?!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, an extremely imposing voice arose abruptly.<br>It was the voice of the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s headmaster.<br>&ldquo;Song Jinglun, do not waste everyone&rsquo;s time. More than that, do not forget your mission.&rdquo;<br>Following that, the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster&rsquo;s voice also sounded.<br>Even though they knew why their disciples were quarreling, neither of them wanted them to miss the decisive opportunity.<br>With this, even though Ouyang Pingzhi and Song JInglun were still very displeased with each other, they had no choice but to obediently enter the spirit formation world.<br>As for the spirit formation world, it seemed to be able to sense everything.<br>Even though the All-heaven Sect and other powers had entered the spirit formation world ahead of them, there was no change to the spirit formation after they entered.<br>However, once the disciples from the Wind Lightning Sword Sect and Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain entered, after everyone had entered the spirit formation world, the spirit formation world immediately started changing.<br>After entering the spirit formation world, Chu Feng was unable to see the world they saw in the mirror image outside.<br>Their field of vision was limited. After all, that world was simply too enormous.<br>However, at that moment, five rays of light appeared in the sky.<br>The lights were dazzling, like five bright suns.<br>Upon closer inspection, those five bright lights contained five weapons.<br>Each of those weapons were extremely exquisite, and enormous in size.<br>Even though the distance between the crowd and those weapons was very far, they were able to deduce that those weapons were each at least tens of thousands of meters in length. They were truly colossal weapons.<br>Those five weapons were not only enormous, but they also emitted overwhelming might. It was as if they were rulers among weapons.<br>Even though the distance between the crowd and the weapons was so far away, they were still able to sense the might of the weapons.<br>Even the dazzling lights were being emitted by the five weapons.<br>All that being said, the most important aspect of all was that even though the five weapons were very imposing, they each had a gap. It seemed like they could be assembled together.<br>Upon closer inspection, the crowd discovered that the five weapons actually complemented one another.<br>Although each of those weapons functioned on their own, they could also be put together to form a single weapon.<br>Although the crowd were unable to determine exactly what sort of existence the final assembled weapon would be, they were filled with expectation just from witnessing the might of the five weapons.<br>At that moment, the disciples from the six great powers had all soared into the sky. They all wanted to obtain those weapons.<br>Those five weapons were located in the central region of the spirit formation world, and in the sky on top of that.<br>Even though they were currently able to clearly see the weapons, they knew that the distance between them and the weapons was extremely vast.<br>Even with their speed, it would take a certain amount of time to reach them.<br>As such, they must rush, or else they would miss out on the decisive opportunity.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Right when the disciples set off toward those five weapons, thunder sounded in the sky.<br>Then, countless purple lightning snakes galloped in midair.<br>There were millions and millions of lightning snakes that appeared at the same time. They intermixed with each other and created a purple sea of lightning.<br>That sea of lightning was extremely terrifying. Although it did not attack anyone, the crowd were capable of sensing how terrifyingly powerful the lightning was.<br>Even though all those people of the younger generation were proud and arrogant, they still tensed up after seeing the sea of lightning, and did not dare to move rashly.<br>As the sea of lightning was right below those five weapons, it was like a barrier blocking the crowd from them.<br>If one wanted to obtain those five weapons, one must first pass through the sea of lightning.<br>But, with how terrifying that sea of lightning was, how was one supposed to pass through it?<br>&ldquo;With how fierce that lightning is, how exactly are we supposed to retrieve the treasures?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not to mention us, even Utmost Exalteds would not necessarily be able to retrieve those treasures, no?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, complaints began to sound from the disciples of all six powers.<br>In fact, it was not only the disciples inside the spirit formation world complaining; even the crowd that were witnessing everything through the mirror image outside were sighing.<br>They were all able to see how terrifying the purple lightning was. They knew that likely not even Utmost Exalteds would be able to withstand that purple lightning. Thus, how could a bunch of people of the younger generation with Exalted and even Martial Immortal-level cultivations possibly be able to? Before the sea of purple lightning, they were incomparably weak.<br>As such, the sea of lightning served as an insurmountable barrier.<br></p></div>
