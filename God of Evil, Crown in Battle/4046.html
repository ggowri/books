        <h1>Chapter 4045</h1>
        <div> - Revealing One&rsquo;s Cultivation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Chu Feng, what are you talking about!?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, do not speak nonsense!&rdquo;<br>Many Chu Heavenly Clansmen were terrified upon hearing what Chu Feng said.<br>Even the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief began urging Chu Feng against it. In fact, he even attempted to snatch the letter back from Chu Feng. He was deeply afraid that his actions would court a disaster.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that he didn&rsquo;t believe in Chu Feng. After all, it was Chu Feng who had fought against the Linghu Heavenly Clan, not them.<br>As such, he knew how capable he was.<br>Yet, the situation at present was different from before.<br>It would be one thing if it were only the Wuming Clan.<br>However, even the Ancestral Martial Dragon City&rsquo;s Envoy was there.<br>Even the Ancestral Martial Dragon City stood on the Wuming Clan&rsquo;s side. With the situation being like that, one absolutely could not provoke the Wuming Clan.<br>Unfortunately, he knew that Chu Feng was a very stubborn person.<br>Because of that, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was truly afraid. He feared that Chu Feng&rsquo;s stubbornness would provoke an unnecessary calamity.<br>&ldquo;Audacious Chu Feng, are you planning to disobey Lord City Master&rsquo;s decree?!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a furious shout was heard. It was the Dragon City Envoy.<br>After the Dragon City Envoy became furious, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen became even more afraid.<br>However, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression remained unchanged. He even smiled sarcastically.<br>&ldquo;What I&rsquo;m doing is not an act of disobedience. Rather, I am complying with Lord City Master&rsquo;s decree.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The decree clearly stated that the overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield shall be assumed by one that is capable.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Wuming Clan is unable to even take on the Linghu Heavenly Clan. After being beaten, they fled in defeat.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How could a power like that possibly be qualified to be the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s overlord?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>The crowd were all astonished to hear those words.<br>Earlier, the crowd had thought that Chu Feng&rsquo;s behavior was because he had not read the contents of the scroll properly.<br>However, after he said those words, the crowd knew that he really intended to go against the Ancestral Martial Dragon City&rsquo;s City Master&rsquo;s decree.<br>After all, everyone knew that the Chu Heavenly Clan could not possibly compare to the Linghu Heavenly Clan.<br>Everyone also knew that Chu Feng was not an ordinary person of the younger generation.<br>Back then, not even Gu Mingyuan was able to handle the Linghu Heavenly Clan. However, by using the power of a treasure, Chu Feng had managed to suppress the Linghu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>Seeing how firm Chu Feng&rsquo;s attitude was, the crowd felt that perhaps they&rsquo;d be able to witness a show.<br>After all, since Chu Feng was able to take on the Linghu Heavenly Clan then, it would mean that he&rsquo;d be able to take on the Wuming Clan at the present time.<br>The only difference was that Chu Feng had been backed by the Ancestral Martial Dragon City then, whereas it was the Wuming Clan that was being backed by Ancestral Martial Dragon City at that moment.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that young friend Chu Feng is very confident.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since you&rsquo;re so confident, why not allow me to witness whether or not you're truly capable of allowing your Chu Heavenly Clan to sit on the starfield&rsquo;s overlord&rsquo;s seat firmly.&rdquo;<br>As Wuming Doutian spoke, he began walking forward. He intended to attack Chu Feng.<br>However, an arm suddenly appeared before him, stopping him.<br>It was the Dragon City Envoy.<br>&ldquo;Lord Envoy, you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Wuming Doutian was surprised to see the Dragon City Envoy stopping him.<br>A panicked look appeared in his previously unflustered eyes.<br>The Dragon City Envoy was naturally weaker than Wuming Doutian.<br>However, he represented Ancestral Martial Dragon City.<br>If the Dragon City Envoy intended to stop him, he really wouldn&rsquo;t dare to touch Chu Feng.<br>Wuming Doutian knew better than anyone else exactly how powerful Ancestral Martial Dragon City was.<br>&ldquo;Brother Wuming, please rest assured. Leave this matter to this old man to handle.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since it is our Ancestral Martial Dragon City that handed the starfield&rsquo;s overlord position to the Chu Heavenly Clan, it should naturally be our Ancestral Martial Dragon City that retrieves it.&rdquo;<br>After hearing those words, Wuming Doutian&rsquo;s previously frozen expression thawed into a smile.<br>It turned out that the Dragon City Envoy actually planned to stand up for his Wuming Clan.<br>After the Dragon City Envoy said those words, the Wuming Clan&rsquo;s morale was boosted enormously.<br>It was not only the Wuming Clan that felt joyous; the mocking expressions on the faces of the people that were taking delight in the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s misfortune became even more intense.<br>They thought to themselves, &lsquo;Chu Feng, you were arrogant earlier because you were relying on the power of the Ancestral Martial Dragon City.&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;Now that Ancestral Martial Dragon City is not helping you anymore, what are you going to do?&rdquo;<br>&lsquo;Perhaps you might dare to take on the Wuming Clan.&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;However, do you dare to take on the Ancestral Martial Dragon City?&rsquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you are indeed worthy of credit for repelling the Linghu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, you were relying on the power of a treasure to accomplish that.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;When all is said and done, martial cultivators need to rely on themselves.&rdquo;<br>The Dragon City Envoy&rsquo;&rsquo;s voice sounded again!<br>However, this time around, his voice sounded from right before Chu Feng.<br>The crowd only noticed that the Dragon City Envoy had arrived before Chu Feng when they looked over.<br>The Dragon City Envoy had not only appeared before Chu Feng, he had also released his oppressive might. That was rank one Utmost Exalted-level oppressive might.<br>Rank one Utmost Exalted, that was a strength capable of causing the majority of the people present to tremble in fear.<br>The Dragon City Envoy did not attack Chu Feng with his oppressive might. He merely restricted his mobility.<br>&ldquo;To be taught a lesson by your own people would be better than being taught a lesson by an outsider.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although you possess exceptional talent, you are excessively arrogant and willful. That is a bad thing.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What this old man is doing today is also for your own good.&rdquo;<br>The Dragon City Envoy looked at Chu Feng with a mocking gaze. After he finished saying those words, he extended his hand. He intention was to take the invitation letter from Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>However, at the moment his hand was about to land on the invitation letter, the invitation letter suddenly moved and avoided his hand.<br>This scene greatly astonished everyone.<br>Wasn&rsquo;t Chu Feng&hellip; supposed to be restricted by the Dragon City Envoy&rsquo;s oppressive might?<br>Because of that, the crowd, including even the Dragon City Envoy, all sharply turned their gazes to Chu Feng.<br>Upon doing so, they discovered that he was looking at the Dragon City Envoy with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;Lord Envoy, I naturally understand your intention.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I will let you know that I, Chu Feng, am definitely not someone to speak conceited nonsense.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng waved the invitation letter in his hand and looked to Wuming Doutian.<br>&ldquo;Wuming Doutian, if you want this invitation letter, come and get it yourself,&rdquo; he said.<br>However, after Chu Feng said those words, a furious shout exploded beside his ear. &ldquo;You little bastard, you dare look down on this old man like this?!&rdquo;<br>It was the Dragon City Envoy.<br>He felt that he had been humiliated by Chu Feng, and had ended up revealing his true nature from rage.<br>His previous cultured and refined manner of conduct had completely disappeared, and was replaced with a fierce expression.<br>His oppressive might was no longer simply restricting Chu Feng&rsquo;s movement. Instead, it had turned into an attack, and was moving to oppress Chu Feng.<br>Although his oppressive might held no intention of taking his life, it was definitely going to inflict serious injuries.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>However, after he shouted those words, not only did his oppressive might disappear, but even he himself was petrified. He was stuck in midair, unable to move a single step.<br>This scene completely puzzled the bystanders. Even the Dragon City Envoy himself felt puzzled.<br>It was only when Chu Feng spoke that they came to a sudden realization.<br>&ldquo;The reason why I&rsquo;m not attacking you is because I am giving face to Lord Dragon City&rsquo;s Master.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d best not refuse the face that is given to you. Not to mention you, a mere envoy, even if it were the celestial emperor himself that touched my baseline, I would absolutely not let him off lightly.&rdquo;<br>The gaze that Chu Feng looked at the Dragon City Envoy with had turned cold and gloomy.<br>Seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze, the Dragon City Envoy felt his heart tense up. He actually felt fear.<br>However, at the same time as he felt fear, he was also feeling puzzled.<br>He was unable to sense any oppressive might. In fact, he was unable to sense any power at all. Yet, he most definitely had his movement restricted.<br>Furthermore, after hearing Chu Feng's words he wondered, could it be that the one who had restricted him was really Chu Feng?<br>But, without oppressive might or any other sort of power...<br>&hellip; how did Chu Feng manage to restrict him?<br></p></div>
