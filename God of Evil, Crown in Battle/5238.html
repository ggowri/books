        <h1>Chapter 5238</h1>
        <div>: Killing the Situ Beasts<br>&ldquo;Elder, I&rsquo;ll have to take my leave now. Here, allow me to propose one last toast to you.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng raised his bowl and gulped the remaining wine down.<br>&ldquo;So fast? Young friend, why don&rsquo;t you leave your address behind? I&rsquo;ll look for you once I&rsquo;m back at the Holy Light Galaxy,&rdquo; Shengguang Daokui said.<br>&ldquo;Elder, I&rsquo;m afraid that I don&rsquo;t have any permanent residence at the moment. Why don&rsquo;t I pay you a visit at the Holy Valley once I return to the Holy Light Galaxy?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Young friend, you must take care of yourself,&rdquo; Shengguang Daokui said worriedly.<br>While their meeting had been short, he could tell that Chu Feng was no ordinary junior from how he carried himself. He could already guess that Chu Feng had already made a name for himself in the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>But the Holy Light Galaxy was nowhere close in comparison to the Totem Galaxy. It was nothing more than a humble village against a huge city.<br>Chu Feng was just like someone who had achieved success in the village and was venturing into the city for the first time. No matter how successful he was in his own village, there were many people who were much more formidable than him in the city.<br>Not to mention, Chu Feng said that he was in the Totem Galaxy to exact vengeance. It was inevitable that Shengguang Daokui would feel worried for him.<br>&ldquo;Elder, I advise you to disguise yourself for the junior hunting competition,&rdquo; Chu Feng told Shengguang Daokui via voice transmission.<br>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Daokui accepted the advice without any hesitation. Having been through many storms himself, he could sense that Chu Feng was worried about implicating him.<br>Meanwhile, Chu Feng intentionally avoided the three old men&rsquo;s line of sight and quickly headed out. However, just as he reached the doorway, a brawny young man suddenly entered the tavern.<br>The brawny young man was dressed in a black robe and carried a massive saber on his back. His saber was a top-quality Exalted Armament from the Ancient Era. Just like the three old men, he made no attempts to conceal his cultivation too&mdash;rank nine Martial Exalted level.<br>However, he was a junior.<br>&ldquo;Oh my, young master Tang, it&rsquo;s a huge honor to have you here! Please forgive us for our humble reception!&rdquo;<br>The tavern manager rushed forward and welcomed the brawny young man.<br>From that, Chu Feng could tell right away the brawny young man had a formidable background. Not even three old men of the Situ World Spiritist Clan had received such a warm welcome. That being said, he didn&rsquo;t bother thinking too much into it.<br>It was none of this business, after all.<br>Chu Feng quickly moved to a remote location, where he waited for the other three old men to leave the tavern. He planned to take their dantian to gain access to the spirit beast mountain valley. There was no need for him to specifically hunt a junior from the Situ World Spiritist Clan since he was already a junior himself. All he was lacking was their bloodline.<br>In order to keep an eye on the movements of the three old men, he eavesdropped on the tavern and noticed that the conversations were now centered around the brawny young man.<br>It turned out that he was Tang Xiu, a top-notch prodigy.<br>Tang Xiu was born into a decent clan. It was said that he had triggered a phenomenon during his birth, which caught the eye of a powerhouse of the Totem Galaxy, Zhuang Qing. He was later taken in as a disciple, and he slowly rose through the ranks to become Zhuang Qing&rsquo;s only personal disciple.<br>Considering that the True Dragon Starfield was one of the minor starfields of the Totem Galaxy, the arrival of someone as esteemed as Tang Xiu in such a humble place was bound to cause a commotion.<br>Chu Feng had already met quite a few prodigies ever since he entered the Totem Galaxy, and the one who left the deepest impression on him was still Bai Yunqing, the disciple of the First Guest Elder of the Totem Galaxy, Lord Taishi Xingzhong.<br>Despite being a junior as well, Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s cultivation was at Half-God level whereas his spirit power had reached God-cloak. That made him stronger than Chu Feng in all aspects.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, do you feel pressured?&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>&ldquo;The Totem Galaxy does have many formidable prodigies, but I don&rsquo;t feel pressured at all,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t plan on just competing with my peers. It&rsquo;s the older generation behind them whom I&rsquo;m seeking to overtake.&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You talk big for a weakling, but this Queen likes your confidence,&rdquo; Eggy replied with a satisfied laugh.<br>There was a clear difference between confidence and arrogance. Chu Feng&rsquo;s words sounded brazen, but they didn&rsquo;t stem from arrogance. She had no doubt that Chu Feng would be able to achieve what he had set out to do.<br>Moments later, Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes narrowed. The people whom he was waiting for had finally arrived. The three old men of the Situ World Spiritist Clan rose into the air and flew off.<br>Chu Feng quietly followed them while remaining in concealment.<br>As soon as there was no one else in their vicinity, the three old men began conversing amongst themselves with despicable smiles on their faces. When Chu Feng overheard the content of their conversation, he became even more certain that the three of them deserved to die.<br>They had ordered their underlings to capture the young ladies in the vicinity, planning to use them for something. But before that, the three old men planned to first take advantage of them for their own merriment, which was also why they had traveled to the tavern to get some wine.<br>Chu Feng discreetly followed them into a floating palace.<br>Hundreds of Situ World Spiritist Clansmen were gathered there, but what was more notable were the thousands of young women they had imprisoned here. These women didn&rsquo;t possess strong cultivation, but they were all beautiful in their own rights.<br>Chu Feng was able to peer inside the palace through his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes.<br>He saw a room in the floating palace that contained a huge array of torture tools, some of them even stained with blood. It wasn&rsquo;t too hard to imagine just how perverse those three old men were. Had Chu Feng not followed them here, the thousands of women imprisoned here would have been put through great suffering before being killed.<br>Other than that, there was also a refinement formation in the middle of the palace.<br>It would appear that the Situ World Spiritist Clan&rsquo;s ultimate goal of capturing those women wasn&rsquo;t for merriment but to refine them.<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t know why they had specifically targeted beautiful women without any regard for their cultivation, but refining a living person was the deed of a demonic cult.<br>&ldquo;Those lowlifes!&rdquo;<br>Without any hesitation, Chu Feng came out of his hiding and kicked open the palace doors.<br>&ldquo;Who dares to barge into our Situ World Spiritist Clan&rsquo;s territory?&rdquo;<br>The Situ World Spiritist Clansmen initially jolted in fright, worried that their evil deeds had been exposed. However, their hearts settled down when they finally got a closer look at Chu Feng, and they reverted back to their fierce appearances.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t recognize me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a sneer.<br>&ldquo;Who would recognize a nameless junior like you?&rdquo;<br>A Situ World Spiritist Clansman brandished his sword at Chu Feng to silence him for good. Another one sealed up the entrance using his spirit power to stop Chu Feng from escaping.<br>Chu Feng stood calmly on the spot for the sword-brandishing Situ World Spiritist Clansman to come close before his hand abruptly shot out to grab the latter by his throat. With a loud &lsquo;kacha&rsquo;, he shattered the latter&rsquo;s neck.<br>&ldquo;Audacious! How dare you kill our Situ World Spiritist Clansman?&rdquo;<br>Everyone from the Situ World Spiritist Clan drew their swords and exerted their oppressive might. They were determined to end Chu Feng&rsquo;s life here.<br>Boom!<br>However, with a single thought from Chu Feng, all of the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen fell to the ground like dogs, including the three old men. It was the prowess of Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power!<br>Even though he was only at rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation, he was able to further raise his spirit power by two ranks. That made it difficult for anyone beneath Half-God level to rival him.<br>&ldquo;What are you standing around for? Leave! Make sure to tell others about this so that the world would be enlightened to the true colors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan!&rdquo;<br>The imprisoned woman immediately rushed out of the palace, not bothering to utter a single word of thanks. However, Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t bothered about this since he wasn&rsquo;t helping them to receive their gratitude.<br>&ldquo;Young hero, please stop what you&rsquo;re doing. Could there be some kind of misunderstanding here?&rdquo;<br>Knowing that they were in a disastrous position, the rank nine Martial Exalted level old man hurriedly spoke up in hopes of mediating the situation.<br>&ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t recognize me? Has the group you sent to the Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm not returned yet?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked in surprise.<br>He thought that his name would be known throughout the Situ World Spiritist Clan by now, but who could have thought that none of them recognized him?<br>&ldquo;Young hero, we have never been to the Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm. Did you have a conflict with our clansmen at the Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm? Even if that was the case, it has nothing to do with us! There must be some kind of misunderstanding here!&rdquo; the old man exclaimed.<br>&ldquo;There is no misunderstanding here. My target are the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>He turned his eyes toward one of the palace doors and tore it down with a single punch.<br>&ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t let these tools go to waste,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a vicious glint in his eyes.<br>The Situ World Spiritist Clansmen deserved to die, but they couldn&rsquo;t be allowed to die that easily. Knowing what Chu Feng was going to do next, their faces paled in horror.<br>Goosebump-inducing screams of agony echoed within the palace for a long time to come.<br>After dealing with the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen, Chu Feng took their bloodline and inserted it into his own body. He was confident of fooling the formation with his current means.<br>With a swipe of his hand, he collected the treasures and origin energies of the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen. The entire palace was stained with blood, but he didn&rsquo;t feel guilt-ridden in the least. Rather, he felt a little regretful.<br>If he hadn&rsquo;t been in such a rush, he would have definitely made those beasts suffer more.<br>He left the palace and returned to the vicinity of the spirit beast mountain valley, where he secretly constructed a formation. Naturally, he had a use for this formation later on.<br>Quite a few people had already gathered around the mountain valley by then, but none of them recognized Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng thought that there were two possibilities behind this.<br>One, the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen who had been at the Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm hadn&rsquo;t returned to the clan, so the others still didn&rsquo;t know that he was on their clan&rsquo;s wanted list.<br>Two, Taowu&rsquo;s threat had intimidated them into removing Chu Feng from their wanted list, which would also explain why the others didn&rsquo;t know who he was.<br>Either way, this was good news for Chu Feng. It was much easier for him to move around without any eyes on him.<br>&ldquo;An old man from the Holy Light Galaxy actually dares to challenge Tang Xiu? He must be tired of living!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng suddenly heard a conversation between two cultivators that shook his heart.<br>Old man from the Holy Light Galaxy? Tang Xiu?<br>&ldquo;Tell me more about what you have just said,&rdquo; Chu Feng stepped forward and asked.<br></div>
