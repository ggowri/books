        <h1>Chapter 853</h1>
        <div> - Two Treasures<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>&ldquo;Lord Third Immortal, thank you for saving me. I didn&rsquo;t think an insignificant person such as myself would be worthy of your great exertion of power.<br>&ldquo;You have given me a new life, something that can never be repaid. However, as long as you demand it, Lord Third Immortal, if you ask me to be an animal, I will not refuse.&rdquo;<br>At that instant, the head of the Stone Sword Sect felt endless gratitude towards the Third Immortal. He knew it was he who saved him. He also knew the Third Immortal had spent hefty sum on him&mdash;at least those several medicinal pellets were very rare treasures. Even to the point where the value of every single pellet was higher than himself, a rank seven Martial Lord.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen your determination and strong desire to join the Immortal Execution Archipelago. We must protect people like you with everything we have. If you truly feel grateful, then in the future, just devote yourself to the Immortal Execution Archipelago,&rdquo; said the Third Immortal with a faint smile.<br>&ldquo;I will definitely pledge myself to the Immortal Execution Archipelago.&rdquo;<br>After hearing the Third Immortal&rsquo;s words, the head of the Stone Sword Sect felt even more grateful. But other than giving his thanks, there was nothing else he could do. In the end, he cast his gaze towards the pond and asked, &ldquo;Lord Third Immortal, is this the entrance to the Burning Heaven Church?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes. The Arctic Killing Formation was not simple at all. It was all thanks to Chu Feng that we were able to come here.<br>&ldquo;He must have seen a map, otherwise how did he know the entrance was here?<br>&ldquo;From my understanding, the identity of Chu Feng&rsquo;s master is very enigmatic. Judging by my experience with him, he himself is quite special as well. Not only is he related to the Crippling Night Demon Sect, he&rsquo;s even related to the Burning Heaven Church. I truly want to know who his master is,&rdquo; said the head of the Stone Sword Sect curiously.<br>&ldquo;You should have heard that Chu Feng has quite good relationship with Lady Qiushui, from the Lovers Terrace, right?&rdquo; the Third Immortal asked with a smile.<br>&ldquo;I have.&rdquo; The head of the Stone Sword Sect nodded.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve always suspected that Lady Qiushui was the Holy Daughter of the Burning Heaven Church. And since Chu Feng is so closely related to her, naturally it means he is closely related to the Burning Heaven Church,&rdquo; said the Third Immortal with a faint smile.<br>&ldquo;So that Lady Qiushui is the Holy Daughter of the Burning Heaven Church! But didn&rsquo;t they relocate into the Holy Land of Martialism? Qiushui Fuyan didn&rsquo;t go?&rdquo; The head of the Stone Sword Sect was very shocked when he heard that.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a guess. It cannot be confirmed.<br>&ldquo;The reason why I didn&rsquo;t capture Chu Feng immediately after discovering him was because I felt he had come here possibly for the Burning Heaven Church. So, I secretly followed to find his actual goal. It seems my speculations were correct and he had indeed come here for the Burning Heaven Church.<br>&ldquo;Initially, I believed Chu Feng knew the true entrance of the Burning Heaven Church as well, which was why he dared to directly enter the Arctic Killing Formation.<br>&ldquo;However, after coming here, I discovered he actually didn&rsquo;t know where it was. He&rsquo;d always had a Spirit Formation activated, and was searching with a very special method. He had found this entrance himself. So, that&rsquo;s why I said he truly isn&rsquo;t a simple person at all,&rdquo; the Third Immortal said.<br>&ldquo;This means he is truly quite amazing, and he truly does have Secret Skills on him. This child cannot slip away because he himself is a huge treasure.<br>&ldquo;Lord Third Immortal, are we going to go down now and capture Chu Feng?&rdquo; the head of the Stone Sword Sect asked.<br>&ldquo;Of course, but judging by your state right now, you should not go. Follow this map and head back to the Stone Sword Sect.&rdquo; The Third Immortal gave a map to the sect head.<br>Opening it and giving it a glance, he couldn&rsquo;t help but be taken aback. The map seemed to be just created; it was likely drawn by the Third Immortal as he followed the path Chu Feng chose.<br>Clearly, the Immortal Execution Archipelago hadn&rsquo;t had their eyes on the Burning Heaven Church for merely a day or two. It was likely that soon, the Burning Heaven Church would be renamed to the Immortal Execution Archipelago.<br>However, after receiving the map, the head of the Stone Sword Sect did not leave immediately. He was hesitating over something. He looked as if he had something to say, but didn&rsquo;t dare to speak.<br>Seeming to have seen through the sect head&rsquo;s thoughts, the Third Immortal faintly smiled, then said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry and return. I&rsquo;ve seen what you did. I&rsquo;ve already ordered someone from the Immortal Execution Archipelago to head to the Stone Sword Sect. He will arrange a spot in the Immortal Execution Archipelago, and from now on, your Stone Sword Sect is an ally with the Immortal Execution Archipelago. You will receive our protection.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thank you Lord Third Immortal, thank you Lord Third Immortal!&rdquo; When he heard those words, the head of the Stone Sword Sect rejoiced. He quickly bowed and clasped his hands at the Third Immortal. Only when he was urged away did he turn around and leave, following the path on the map.<br>After the head of the Stone Sword Sect left, the Third Immortal looked back at the entrance, and said with a smile, &ldquo;This Shi Jingtian is correct: Chu Feng is indeed a huge treasure. But what is awaiting me is not only a single treasure, but two. Chu Feng, oh Chu Feng, you have truly helped me greatly.&rdquo;<br>After speaking, the smile on the Third Immortal&rsquo;s face became even wider, and as he spoke, he leaped and entered the water.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng was still flying quickly within that paradise. After some quick traveling, Chu Feng was certain he was safe.<br>Due to a moment of carelessness&mdash;causing him to be followed by the Third Immortal&mdash;Chu Feng had exhausted nearly all of his Spirit power to the most sensitive state. Moreover, he laid many Detection Spirit Formations, so he was certain the Third Immortal hadn&rsquo;t tailed him.<br>On the road, Chu Feng not only saw many beautiful sceneries, he even saw many exquisite and aesthetically pleasing buildings. All of the structures in here were made out of gold, and there were even engravings of flames. It was clear this was the Burning Heaven Church.<br>&ldquo;Eggy, typically speaking, within an endless winter plains, such a paradise shouldn&rsquo;t appear, right? Say, is everything here real or fake?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked curiously.<br>&ldquo;The flowers, plants, trees, and even buildings are real. However, from what I see, the sky, clouds, and the fiery sun are fake. This is a space opened by a powerful World Spiritist,&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>&ldquo;This is many times vaster than the space in the Asura Ghost Tower. However, back then, the strongest person in the Burning Heaven Church was Huangfu Haoyue. Judging by his strength, he shouldn&rsquo;t be able to open up a space.<br>&ldquo;Could it be a senior from the Burning Heaven Church?&rdquo; Even though he had made guesses, after Eggy confirmed that the world was not real and it was only a space created up by a Spirit Formation expert, Chu Feng still felt greatly astonished.<br>&ldquo;Heh, silly, no one in the Burning Heaven Church has the ability to do this.<br>&ldquo;However, judging by the various things from the Ancient Era in the Everlasting Sea of Blood and at the Misty Peak, there had truly been geniuses and experts in the Eastern Sea Region before. This place should have been created by experts of the Ancient Era.<br>&ldquo;But perhaps by chance, someone from the Burning Heaven Church discovered this place and received a lucky opportunity. As such, they established this place to be the Burning Heaven Church, and had quite a smooth development as well,&rdquo; Eggy analyzed.<br>&ldquo;Mm, that makes sense.&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded, his question in his heart answered. However, suddenly, his pupils suddenly shrank as he shouted, pointing in front of him, &ldquo;Eggy, look there!&rdquo;<br></p></div>
