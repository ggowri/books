        <h1>Chapter 5722: Ancestral Dragon’s Secret Skill</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the ancestral dragon&rsquo;s secret skill. Everyone, channel your bloodline cultivation method!&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief roared as soon as the dragon&rsquo;s beard appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took the lead to sit down cross-legged and channeled his bloodline cultivation method, and the other clansmen also forced themselves to do the same despite the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A layer of golden aura formed around them and fused together with the dragon&rsquo;s beard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the pained expressions on the crowd&rsquo;s faces alleviated, though their movements remained bound by the dragon&rsquo;s beard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Chu Feng sensed that the binding energy around him was getting stronger, such that the formation he had prepared beforehand was struggling to stand its ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t good,&rdquo; Chu Feng murmured as he quickly sat down to channel the formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, nine elders were gathered in a special palace outside the Totem Dragon </span><span>Clan&rsquo;s forbidden land. They used to be the most powerful experts of the Totem Dragon Clan, but all of them betrayed the clan for various reasons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they were Long Lin&rsquo;s aides. They had supported him in the revolt, making them meritorious subjects under the new leadership.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a while ago, they received an order from Long Lin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder Tenghui, what should we do?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other eight elders in the room all turned to a single elder named Long Tenghui. He was the strongest in the group, and he used to be one of the Nine Flags Dragon Warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What else can we do? We can only obey Lord Long Lin&rsquo;s order,&rdquo; Long Tenghui said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other eight elders were appalled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. Long Xu is amongst them too!&rdquo; one of the elders voiced out the group&rsquo;s worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What are you afraid of? Their fighting prowess has been restricted,&rdquo; Long Tenghui said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Lord Tenghui, he&rsquo;s the clan chief, after all. Can we really deal with him even if he has his cultivation restricted? We don&rsquo;t really know the extent of his means. What&rsquo;s Lord Long Lin doing? Why doesn&rsquo;t he personally make a move?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were afraid despite knowing that the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and Long Xu had their fighting prowess sealed off. The strength of the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was too firmly imprinted in their souls. Just the thought of opposing him induced fear in them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;This might be Lord Long Lin&rsquo;s test. He wants to see how loyal we are. Don&rsquo;t forget, we have been abandoned by the Totem Dragon Clan. Lord Long Lin gave us the chance to return to the Totem Dragon Clan and bestowed us our current positions. It&rsquo;s just that we are Totem Dragon Clansmen, after all, so it&rsquo;s only normal for Lord Long Lin to have reservations about our loyalty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;This is an opportunity for us to prove ourselves. As long as we accomplish this task, we&rsquo;ll truly become Lord Long Lin&rsquo;s aides in the future. We might even become the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s new Nine Flags Dragon Warriors,&rdquo; Long Tenghui said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those words induced a glow in the other elders&rsquo; eyes. It had been their past dream to become one of the Nine Flags Dragon Warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; Long Tenghui said as he headed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other eight elders followed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of them noticed that one of the elders had left an item behind. After they had left the room, the item flew into the distance as a whiz of light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daoist Heavensniffer suddenly opened his eyes and snapped out of his cultivation. He first took a few light sniffs, before his sniffing suddenly became harder. Then, his eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly got up, formed a hand seal, and increased the frequency of his sniffing. Frenzied joy filled his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without any warning, he smacked Beast Shadow&rsquo;s shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beast Shadow was in the midst of his cultivation when he was suddenly smacked, so he flew into a rage. &ldquo;Heavensniffer, are you courting death?!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could make a move, Daoist Heavensniffer said words that extinguished his anger, &ldquo;Chu Feng is out of the forbidden land. Come with me.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daoist Heavensniffer rose into the air, and Beast Shadow quickly followed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time passed, the conditions of the Totem Dragon Clansmen were greatly alleviated. They weren&rsquo;t in as much pain, and they could at least move a little now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the situation was the opposite for Chu Feng. The binding energy restricting him only grew stronger with time. The dragon&rsquo;s beard gathering around him was much more intense than those around the rest of the Totem Dragons Clansmen, to the point where it looked corporeal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng found himself unable to move, and he was put under immense pain too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the others were taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had traced the reason behind this binding energy to the poison Long Lin had previously forced them to consume&mdash;the poison must have contained something belonging to the ancestral dragon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before its death, the ancestral dragon had cast a secret skill that prevented anyone from taking anything relating to it out of the forbidden land. Anyone who tried to do so would be subjected to the binding energy from the ancestral dragon&rsquo;s binding energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why would that happen to Chu Feng? Did Chu Feng consume something related to the ancestral dragon?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, did Long Lin feed you something?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Long Chengyu, and the others, who had barely regained the ability to move around, gathered around Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I have the dragon essence inside of me,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;The dragon essence?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was horrified to hear that. The Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief placed his palm on Chu Feng&rsquo;s body, and his face quickly turned ashened with despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Father, is it really the dragon essence?&rdquo; Long Muxi asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Long Chengyu and the others also stared at the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, their faces filled with worry. They understood what the dragon essence meant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief replied with a nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to rip Long Lin apart!&rdquo; Long Muxi roared with overflowing killing intent as she tried to march toward the forbidden land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the binding energy from the dragon&rsquo;s beard was so strong that she fell to the ground before she could even get far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Calm down, young miss! Focus your energy on circulating your bloodline cultivation method!&rdquo; the crowd advised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That damned Long Lin!&rdquo; Long Chengyu clenched his fists angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about me. I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;How can you be fine? That&rsquo;s the dragon essence! You don&rsquo;t know the dragon essence&hellip;&rdquo; Long Muxi was pained by Chu Feng&rsquo;s plight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I know the energy inside the dragon essence is violent, but I&rsquo;m fine. You may give it a check if you don&rsquo;t believe me. I have already nurtured the dragon essence, such that it isn&rsquo;t as violent as before,&rdquo; Chu Feng squeezed out a smile and replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the others quickly checked on the dragon essence, and they were surprised to see that the dragon essence&rsquo;s energy was not as violent anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;As expected of young friend Chu Feng! You were able to nurture Lord Ancestral Dragon&rsquo;s dragon essence!&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief exclaimed with an impressed sigh,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This would have been an inconceivable feat had it been anyone else, but the Totem Dragon Clansmen were so used to Chu Feng&rsquo;s astonishing feat that they weren&rsquo;t that taken aback anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, did Long Lin force you into it?&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;No, I did it willingly. He told me that the dragon essence can save Elder Long Xue, but its energy is too violent and thus needs to be nurtured first. I had examined the dragon essence before taking it in, so I knew that I should be able to withstand it. I just didn&rsquo;t expect the dragon essence to be trapped inside my body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder Clan Chief, is there a secret skill placed on the forbidden land that prevents one from taking away any item related to the ancestral dragon?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Long Lin forced us to take a poison that immediately fused with our soul and bloodline upon consumption. I didn&rsquo;t think much of it at the start, but who could have thought that it would be something related to Lord Ancestral Dragon? That despicable man actually thought of such a method to trap us here!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief belatedly realized that the poison they had consumed contained something related to the ancestral dragon, and he clenched his jaws in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their clan rules forbade them from coming into contact with anything relating to the ancestral dragon, and doing so was equivalent to blaspheming the ancestral dragon. Yet, Long Lin forced them to consume something related to the ancestral dragon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was humiliating them by doing so, and to them, this was almost worse than death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Father, is there a way to extract the dragon essence?&rdquo; Long Muxi asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I could have given it a try if I recovered my cultivation, but it won&rsquo;t work in my current state,&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief replied with a shake of his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What can we do?&rdquo; Long Muxi worriedly asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, I&rsquo;ll impart to you our Dragon Clan&rsquo;s bloodline cultivation method. Give it a try and see if it&rsquo;ll help you cope,&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was then that a scornful voice echoed, &ldquo;Is the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief planning to impart the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s bloodline cultivation method to an outsider? How shameful!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd looked over and saw nine silhouettes standing in the sky. They were Long Tenghui and the other eight elders.</span></p></div>
