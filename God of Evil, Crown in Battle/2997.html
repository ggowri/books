        <h1>Chapter 2996</h1>
        <div> - Sacred Cultivation Ground<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;......&rdquo;<br>When they saw the current appearance of Chu Ruoshi and the others, the surrounding people of the younger generation all revealed expressions of astonishment.<br>The reason for that was because not only were Chu Ruoshi and the others laying on the ground, but their complexions were also pale-white, and blood was flowing from the corners of their mouth nonstop.<br>It was as if they were seriously injured.<br>&ldquo;This!!!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, panic covered the faces of all of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations present.<br>Chu Ruoshi was, after all, a rank eight True Immortal. Her strength was an entire level of cultivation above Chu Haoyan.<br>However, she was actually defeated by Her Lady Queen with a single attack.<br>This disparity was not small at all.<br>Most importantly, Her Lady Queen was truly ruthless in her attack. Not only did she beat down Chu Ruoshi, but she even injured Chu Haoyan, Chu Huanyu and Chu Zhiyuan, who were standing behind her.<br>However, the crowd knew very well that Her Lady Queen was being lenient. Otherwise, Chu Ruoshi and the others would not only be injured. Instead, they would&rsquo;ve already died.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng waved his sleeve, and several medicinal pellets for treating injuries flew over to Chu Ruoshi and the others.<br>&ldquo;No need,&rdquo; However, Chu Ruoshi and the others refused to accept his medicinal pellets. Instead, they all took out their own medicinal pellets and swallowed them.<br>Although their injuries appeared to be very appalling, they were only minor injuries. To people of their cultivation, their injuries were not serious at all.<br>After swallowing their medicinal pellets, their injuries started to quickly improve. Even their auras returned to normal.<br>&ldquo;Do you all insist on forcing me to retrieve the banners myself?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I will trust you today. I hope that you will keep your promise and not seize all the treasures for yourself,&rdquo; Chu Ruoshi stood up. She did not try to continue to argue with Chu Feng. Instead, she directly took out her banner and handed it to Chu Feng.<br>After Chu Ruoshi handed her banner to Chu Feng, Chu Haoyan, Chu Huanyu and Chu Zhiyuan also took out their banners and handed them to Chu Feng.<br>Even though they ended up handing their banners to Chu Feng, their expressions remained very ugly. This was especially true for Chu Ruoshi. At that moment, her hostility toward Chu Feng was completely revealed.<br>That said, Chu Feng already knew of the hostility the four of them felt toward him. Thus, he was not surprised in the slightest, nor did he concern himself with it.<br>After receiving the banners from the four of them, Chu Feng finally finished the grand formation in his hand.<br>At that moment, the grand formation grew even brighter. A heaven and earth-toppling change was unfolding inside the formation.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s grand formation was like a world spirit compass. It was capable of guiding Chu Feng to the location of the most precious treasures in the Yin Yang Gate.<br>However, like the Yin Yang Formation Diagram in the sky, only Chu Feng was able to comprehend his grand formation.<br>Holding the grand formation in hand, Chu Feng began to move. The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations followed closely behind him. No one said a single word during that period of time.<br>They had no choice anymore. Even though they did not trust Chu Feng completely, they could only choose to trust Chu Feng at that moment.<br>As they followed Chu Feng, they passed through many mountain ranges. Finally, they arrived at a cave.<br>That cave was very distinctive. Not only was the top of the cave filled with glimmering stones that resembled stars scattered all around the cave, but they were also able to feel a vast amount of natural energies upon entering the cave.<br>Furthermore, as they continued to go deeper into the cave, the intensity of the natural energies inside the cave grew even stronger.<br>With the situation being like that, the crowd&rsquo;s tensed faces started to ease, and were soon replaced with expressions of joy. Furthermore, the joy on their faces was growing stronger and stronger.<br>They started to feel that Chu Feng did not deceive them. At the very least, that place was absolutely not an ordinary place.<br>Overwhelmed with excitement, someone finally asked Chu Feng, &ldquo;Little brother Chu Feng, are we about to reach the location of the treasures?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Mn, we&rsquo;re almost there,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>Once Chu Feng said those words, the crowd grew even more excited. There were even people that started cheering ecstatically.<br>That said, compared to the excitement of the crowd, Chu Lingxi was relatively calm.<br>It was not that she was not feeling joyous. To be able to obtain treasures soon, she would naturally also be happy. It was just that she was able to contain her excitement, unlike the others.<br>The reason for that was because she, unlike the others, believed in Chu Feng from the very start. She felt that Chu Feng would not deceive them, and would not seize the treasures for himself.<br>Meanwhile, Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu&rsquo;s expressions turned very ugly.<br>Chu Feng had actually really discovered the treasures, and did not plan to abandon them and hog the treasures for himself.<br>With that being the case, Chu Feng&rsquo;s status in the hearts of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations would not only not decrease, it would instead increase. Furthermore, if word of this matter were to spread, it would not only raise his status in the hearts of the younger generations present at the moment.<br>Likely, their entire clan&rsquo;s favorability toward Chu Feng would greatly increase.<br>This exiled trash was going to gain the acknowledgement of many people from the Chu Heavenly Clan shortly upon his return. To Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu, two people that greatly detested Chu Feng, it would naturally not be a good thing.<br>That said, Chu Feng had no heart to concern himself with their shenanigans. His current goal was very simple. He wanted to quickly find and then obtain the treasures.<br>After all, the Nine Moons Sacred Domain would only be open for a finite amount of time. He had to finish all that he needed to do within the time limit. Otherwise, he would be trapped, and face absolute death.<br>After a somewhat long journey, Chu Feng and the others finally arrived at the end of the cave. No, to be exact, it was not the end. There was still a path before them.<br>That said, compared to the spacious cave, the path ahead was very narrow. Only a single person could pass through the path at once. However, seeing that narrow path, the crowd&rsquo;s eyes started to shine. Endless anticipation filled their eyes.<br>The reason for that was because everyone was able to sense that the incomparably dense natural energies were coming from that narrow path.<br>Furthermore, being in that space, the amount of natural energies they could feel had already reached a level where they were no longer capable of controlling their excitement.<br>There was most definitely a sacred cultivation ground before them!!!<br>Chu Feng stopped walking, and said to the crowd, &ldquo;According to the formation, the treasures are located ahead. However, it is not only treasures that will be there. There is also a certain amount of danger.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Danger? What sort of danger?&rdquo; The crowd asked.<br>&ldquo;There are not enough indications. Thus, I do not know what sort of dangers there might be either. Only by entering it will we find out,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;But, we&rsquo;re not feeling any danger,&rdquo; The crowd revealed skeptical gazes.<br>&ldquo;Dangers that can be felt are generally not actual dangers. Only when you cannot feel the danger will it be the most fatal.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you all do not believe me, you can follow me in. However, if something is to happen to you inside, I will not take responsibility,&rdquo; Chu Feng said. <br></p></div>
