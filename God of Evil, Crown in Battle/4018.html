        <div> - A Debt Of Blood Must Be Paid In Blood<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, no matter what he said, Zhao Hong continued to ignore him. She behaved as if she couldn&rsquo;t hear him.<br>Zhao Hong did not kill the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster.<br>Rather, using her oppressive might, she pulled him back before Chu Feng.<br>Then, Zhao Hong actually removed the restriction on the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster&rsquo;s body caused by her oppressive might.<br>This situation completely baffled the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster.<br>However, even though Zhao Hong had removed her oppressive might, he did not dare to act rashly.<br>It was only after Zhao Hong spoke that he understood her intentions.<br>&ldquo;Remove the poison from their bodies,&rdquo; Zhao Hong said with an ice-cold tone.<br>&ldquo;If I remove their poisons, can you spare me?&rdquo; asked the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster.<br>He was not trying to make demands.<br>His voice was trembling as he said those words, and his tone was very low and humble.<br>He knew very well what sort of situation he was in. As such, he hoped that Zhao Hong would let him live.<br>&ldquo;If you do not do as I say, you&rsquo;ll die now.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Zhao Hong&rsquo;s oppressive might enveloped the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster once again. Furthermore, this time around, her oppressive might felt fatal.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remove the poisons, I&rsquo;ll remove the poisons.&rdquo;<br>Already scared witless, how could the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster dare to say anything else? He immediately used his trembling hand to take out a special jar from his Cosmos Sack.<br>The jar was inscribed with runes and symbols. He placed the jar on Chu Feng&rsquo;s wound and then began to form hand seals. With that, the runes and symbols on the jar began to flicker with light, and the Nine Stars Corpse-devouring Bugs inside Chu Feng&rsquo;s body crawled out, and into the jar.<br>Using the same method, the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster removed the Nine Stars Corpse-devouring Bugs from the Mystic Cave Saints&rsquo; bodies too.<br>After the Nine Stars Corpse-devouring Bugs were removed, Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints no longer screamed miserably like before.<br>&ldquo;I beg of you, please spare my life.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;My Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain is willing to serve you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Whether you want me to become your horse or your ox, I am wholly willing.&rdquo;<br>After removing the Nine Stars Corpse-devouring Bugs, the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster knelt before Zhao Hong.<br>As the leader of his power, as the strongest expert of his starfield, the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster actually disregarded all of his dignity so that he could survive.<br>He was willing to disregard everything, and even become an object of ridicule, all so that he could survive.<br>However, even though the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster had disregarded his dignity and was wagging his tail before Zhao Hong begging her for forgiveness, Zhao Hong&rsquo;s gaze remained cold and detached.<br>This was especially true when her gaze swept past Chu Feng.<br>Seeing the weak and near-death Chu Feng, the coldness in her eyes not only increased, but killing intent also appeared in her eyes.<br>Suddenly, Zhao Hong said to the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster, &ldquo;You should thank me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;<br>The Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster was momentarily confused.<br>&ldquo;At least, you will die a pleasant death,&rdquo; said Zhao Hong.<br>&ldquo;You!&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster&rsquo;s expression changed enormously.<br>He finally realized what Zhao Hong was implying. From the very start, she had never planned to spare him.<br>Seeing that he would not be able to survive, he opened his mouth with the intention to curse her out.<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>However, before he could even begin, he had turned into a mist of blood. Like the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster, he exploded and died.<br>In merely the blink of an eye, the overlords of two starfields had died at Zhao Hong&rsquo;s hands.<br>Zhao Hong did not plan to stop after killing the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster and the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster. Rather, she turned her gaze to the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;For you, I will not show any mercy,&rdquo; said Zhao Hong.<br>&ldquo;You damned demoness! You shall suffer a miserable death!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Your family, all the people from your Reincarnation Sect, they died because of you!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That Reincarnation Pearl is an item of legend. Even your Reincarnation Sect only has legends of it. No one had ever seen it before.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet, on the day of your birth, not only did an abnormal sign appear in the sky, but you were even born with the Reincarnation Pearl.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ever since the day of your birth, ever since you appeared with the Reincarnation Pearl, the fate of your Reincarnation Sect had been sealed -- they cannot coexist with the Reincarnation Pearl.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You are nothing more than a bearer of ill luck! It is you who caused the destruction of the Reincarnation Sect! You are the one who ruined the Reincarnation Sect! You are the one who caused your family&rsquo;s deaths! You are the one who killed all the people of the Reincarnation Sect!&rdquo;<br>The All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster knew very well that he would not be able to escape death.<br>Thus, he did not beg for forgiveness like the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster. Rather, he began to fiercely curse at Zhao Hong. His words were extremely malicious, and all aimed at her heart.<br>However, Zhao Hong did not become furious because of what the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster said. Her expression remained the same.<br>&ldquo;Liu Shuo, do you still remember this?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Zhao Hong shook her wrist, and an item appeared from her sleeve and drifted in midair.<br>That item was tens of meters long, and had the appearance of an octopus. However, it was not an octopus.<br>An octopus only had eight tentacles, whereas that item had over a hundred tentacles.<br>Its entire body was crimson-red. Each tentacle was covered in sharp fangs.<br>That item appeared very malevolent. Both its tentacles and body were constantly squirming. The instant the crowd saw it, they felt their blood run cold with intense unease.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Zhao Hong, you&hellip; you damned demoness, you will die miserably!&rdquo;<br>Seeing the octopus-like yet extremely sinister-looking object, the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster was completely terrified, so much so that his voice had changed.<br>Perhaps the bystanders might not recognize what the item was. However, he did.<br>In fact, it was he who had told Zhao Hong of the item&rsquo;s existence.<br>He was also the one who'd given Zhao Hong the item.<br>That item was called the Blood-sucking Soul-refining Beast.<br>It was capable of sucking one&rsquo;s blood and refining one&rsquo;s soul.<br>It was actually nothing more than a man-eating monster.<br>However, due to its special poison, it was capable of bringing unimaginable pain to its victims. Reportedly, the torture it caused was the most unbearable sort of torture in the entire world.<br>Back when Liu Shuo was together with Zhao Hong, he had made an oath of eternal love to her.<br>Zhao Hong had asked him what she should do should he betray her.<br>When she'd asked him that question, he had directly taken out that item and given it to her.<br>Furthermore, he'd had told her that if he were to betray her, she could use the Blood-sucking Soul-refining Beast to torture him to death.<br>Actually, the reason why Liu Shuo had put forth such enormous effort to obtain that Blood-sucking Soul-refining Beast was so that he could gain Zhao Hong&rsquo;s trust with it. As such, he had naturally never imagined that he would end up being devoured and tortured by it.<br>Especially at that moment, as it had been so long since then. He had never imagined that Zhao Hong would still keep the Blood-sucking Soul-refining Beast.<br>&ldquo;Liu Shuo, time for you to pay for your crimes.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Zhao Hong pointed at the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;Ji, ji, ji~~~&rdquo;<br>Then, the Blood-devouring Soul-refining Beast seemed to have awakened. It let out strange sounds and shot straight at the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>Soon, the Blood-devouring Soul-refining Beast used its tentacles to envelop the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster. The tentacles covered every inch of his body, and began to squirm rapidly.<br>The crowd were no longer able to see the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster. However, they were able to see a large amount of blood pouring down from the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster&rsquo;s location like rain.<br>At the same time, his miserable screams resonated throughout the surrounding heaven and earth.<br>His screams were even more miserable than the screams of Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints combined.<br>Just by hearing those screams, the crowd revealed looks of pain that showed how unbearable it was to them..<br>However, none of the people from the All-heaven Sect had any heart to concern themselves with their Lord Sectmaster&rsquo;s situaition.<br>All of them, whether elders or disciples, were able to sense a bone-chilling killing intent.<br>&ldquo;A debt of blood must be paid in blood. That is how the world works.&rdquo;<br>Zhao Hong&rsquo;s ice-cold voice sounded.<br></p></div>
