        <h1>Chapter 5119</h1>
        <div>: This Place is a Trap<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Ah, it must be related to your father, Chu Xuanyuan. Say, young friend- No, I mean, master, what kind of person is your father, Chu Xuanyuan?&rdquo; Lord Bai asked out of curiosity.<br>The extent to which he was concerned about Chu Xuanyuan surprised Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Why are you so curious about my father?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Lord Bai revealed the reason.<br>It turned out that he had been with Lord Yuwei for a long time now. Despite his weak cultivation, he was the best at cultivating the Demonsoul Grass, making him one of the most important talents in this land.<br>On top of that, he had done many things for Lord Yuwei when the latter first arrived on this land, making him one of Lord Yuwei&rsquo;s most trusted people. In fact, Lord Yuwei would call him for most matters.<br>There were two times when Lord Yuwei was truly exhausted and fell asleep, and she called out two names in her dream. One was &lsquo;young miss&rsquo;&mdash;she muttered this again and again&mdash;and the other was Chu Xuanyuan.<br>Lord Bai could tell that the &lsquo;young miss&rsquo; Lord Yuwei called out referred to her previous master, but he couldn&rsquo;t make sense of who Chu Xuanyuan was. He tried asking about it, but Lord Yuwei refused to speak.<br>So, Lord Bai thought that Chu Xuanyuan might be Lord Yuwei&rsquo;s lover. After all, Xuanyuan did sound like a man&rsquo;s name. That was also why he immediately assumed that Chu Feng&rsquo;s father was a local back then, especially since he thought that Chu Feng was a local here too.<br>However, it was later revealed that Chu Feng was truly a newcomer here, thus unraveling all of the theories he had crafted thus far.<br>Chu Feng thought that the reason why Lord Yuwei refused to tell Lord Bai about his father was to protect him. As much as she trusted Lord Bai, she wasn&rsquo;t willing to take any risk here.<br>However, there was no one in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm and Ancestral Martial Starfield who didn&rsquo;t know about his father now, so he didn&rsquo;t think that there was a need to conceal his father&rsquo;s identity to Lord Bai anymore.<br>&ldquo;Elder, have you heard about the Chu Heavenly Clan and Chu Hanxian?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I know, I know. The Chu Heavenly Clan is the overlord of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. I am from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm myself, so how could I possibly not know about them? As for Chu Hanxian, I&rsquo;ve heard of him too. He&rsquo;s a prodigy from the Chu Heavenly Clan, right?&rdquo; Lord Bai said.<br>He suddenly thought about something and widened his eyes.<br>&ldquo;My gosh! You&rsquo;re from the Chu Heavenly Clan too?&rdquo; Lord Bai asked.<br>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Eyy, I must be getting senile. I&rsquo;ve been trapped here for too long that I nearly forgot about the Chu Heavenly Clan. I heard about Chu Hanxian from those who came in after me,&rdquo; Lord Bai said with a sigh. &ldquo;But why did you mention Chu Hanxian though? Do you know him?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Know him? He&rsquo;s my grandfather,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied gleefully.<br>&ldquo;Hell! Are you for real?&rdquo;<br>Lord Bai was shocked to hear that news. He smacked his head and revealed a look of realization.<br>&ldquo;I get it now, I get it now! Lord Yuwei&rsquo;s young miss must be your grandmother! Chu Xuanyuan is your father, which makes him Lord Yuwei&rsquo;s young master. That&rsquo;s why she addresses you as a little young master,&rdquo; Lord Bai said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng shot a thumbs up at Lord Bai.<br>&ldquo;Eyy, I would have lived my life in vain if I couldn&rsquo;t even make sense of such a simple relationship.&rdquo;<br>Despite Lord Bai&rsquo;s humble words, his expression was one of glee. He quickly snapped out of it and asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your grandmother&rsquo;s name? She should be from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm too, right? What power is she from? It can&rsquo;t be that she&rsquo;s from the Chu Heavenly Clan too?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Lord Yuwei tell you?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Not at all. Lord Yuwei&rsquo;s lips are tightly sealed. She refuses to divulge any information at all,&rdquo; Lord Bai grumbled.<br>&ldquo;If Lord Yuwei refuses to speak, I won&rsquo;t do so either. You should ask her instead,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with an evil smile.<br>Despite Lord Bai&rsquo;s inquisitive and playful appearance, Chu Feng thought that he was likely to be an upright person. Otherwise, Lord Yuwei wouldn&rsquo;t have trusted him so much either. Lord Yuwei likely had her own considerations for not divulging this information to Lord Bai.<br>Besides, his grandmother had a score to settle with the Situ World Spiritist Clan. The Situ World Spiritist Clan was definitely not a power to be made light of, so it would be wise to keep his grandmother&rsquo;s identity under wraps until they officially waged war.<br>&ldquo;Hmph! If you don&rsquo;t want to tell me, so be it. I&rsquo;m not that curious about it anyway. I was just worried whether Chu Xuanyuan is Lord Yuwei&rsquo;s lover. It&rsquo;s good that I was wrong. Hehehe&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Lord Bai revealed a silly smile on his aged face. Reading the intent behind that smile, Chu Feng teased, &ldquo;I finally understand why you&rsquo;re so concerned about my father. It turns out that you&rsquo;re fond of Lord Yuwei?&rdquo;<br>Lord Bai panicked upon hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;W-w-what?! Don&rsquo;t spout nonsense! What are you saying? How can that be possible? Why would an old man like me harbor such thoughts? Not to mention, I&rsquo;m not worthy of Lord Yuwei. Young friend Chu Feng- No, I mean young master, you mustn&rsquo;t run your mouth about this! There&rsquo;s no way I would dare to be fond of Lord Yuwei!&rdquo;<br>Lord Bai started explaining in a fluster. He was so panicked that cold sweat was dripping down his back. However, his reaction only further confirmed Chu Feng&rsquo;s guess, though it seemed to be more of a secret crush.<br>&ldquo;Lord Bai, let&rsquo;s cut the idle chatter here. Please tell me everything you know about this place. Why is it impossible to leave this place? Is it because we can&rsquo;t leave through the exit or that there are no exits at all?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;There are no exits at all. This place isn&rsquo;t a treasure trove but a trap,&rdquo; Lord Bai said with a sigh.<br>&ldquo;Trap?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng narrowed his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Follow me, young master.&rdquo;<br>Lord Bai brought Chu Feng to the golden river outside the city. It was the exit of the Darknight Sacred River. Had Chu Feng not deciphered the spirit formation gate, he would have flowed along the passageway and eventually arrived here via this golden river.<br>The two of them leaped into the river and quickly dived downward. Chu Feng soon realized that the river was much deeper than he thought.<br>Just as they were about to reach the bottom, there was a sudden burst of light. The closer they approached the bottom, the brighter the light became. On top of that, a hostile aura could be felt from the bottom of the river, hinting that the source of the light was unlikely to be friendly to them.<br>Even though they were still a distance away, Chu Feng was still able to see the situation at the bottom of the river with his sharp eyes.<br>The source of the light came from a massive tombstone that was around ten thousand meters tall. There was a spirit formation gate right beneath the tombstone.<br>The hostile aura was coming from the spirit formation gate.<br></p></div>
