        <h1>Chapter 1744</h1>
        <div> - Golden Palace<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>Seemingly sensing that people had arrived, Yao&rsquo;er opened her clear eyes.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>When she saw Chu Feng and the others, Yao&rsquo;er was immediately overjoyed. An extremely brilliant smile was present on her pure little face. She immediately got up and proceeded to run toward Chu Feng and the others.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right at this moment, a golden light suddenly appeared and blocked Yao&rsquo;er&rsquo;s path. At the moment when the golden light disappeared, a middle-aged man appeared before Chu Feng and the others.<br>This man was precisely that man who called himself Long Lin.<br>This mysterious existence, even when seeing him again today, he still felt as mysterious as before. His deep gaze and shallow smile were both so extraordinary.<br>Chu Feng was unable to see through him and determine what he was thinking. More than that, Chu Feng was unable to determine his strength.<br>Evidently, Long Lin had seen Baili Xuankong and the others. However, he did not place Baili Xuankong and the others in his eyes at all. In fact, he did not even bother to take a glance at them, and directly turned his gaze to Chu Feng.<br>His disdainful attitude caused Baili Xuankong and the others to narrow their brows slightly. They were displeased by his behavior.<br>However, they did not say anything, nor did they do anything. The reason for that was because this man was simply someone that they could not see through.<br>Even Baili Xuankong had realized that this man&rsquo;s strength was most likely above his own. It would be extremely hard to deal with him.<br>Merely, Baili Xuankong did not expect that there would be such an existence in the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Remnants. Exactly how long had this man lived? Could he be an existence from the Ancient Era?<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;ve truly given me a pleasant surprise. I had given you the time limit of returning within two years as a Half Martial Emperor. Yet, it has only been a bit over a year, and you&rsquo;ve already returned with the cultivation of rank three Half Martial Emperor. The speed of your progress is quite good.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Truth be told, you are superior to what I anticipated you to be,&rdquo; Long Lin narrowed his eyes and smiled lightly. It could be seen that he was very happy with Chu Feng&rsquo;s return.<br>&ldquo;Can you release Yao&rsquo;er now?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Long Lin pointed at the tree filled with fruit and asked, &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you ask for those fruits first? I know those fruit are extremely useful to you,&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, Yao&rsquo;er is more important than those fruit,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;......&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Yao&rsquo;er&rsquo;s gaze shone. Her little mouth was slightly open. Specks of glistening teardrops appeared in her two large eyes. At this moment, she was feeling extremely moved.<br>Back then, Chu Feng had come here for the sake of the treasures. For the sake of the treasures, Chu Feng had been willing to brave dangers to charge through the Ancient Era&rsquo;s killing formation.<br>From this, it could be seen how important those treasures were to Chu Feng.<br>Yet, at this moment, Chu Feng was placing her above the treasures. As such, how could she not be moved?<br>Yao&rsquo;er had decided to help Chu Feng out of gratefulness because Chu Feng had saved her. At this moment, the gratefulness she felt toward Chu Feng was even more intense.<br>In fact, not to mention her, even Baili Xuankong and the others were nodding at Chu Feng in admiration.<br>Especially Baili Xuankong. He felt that he had not misjudged Chu Feng. Chu Feng&rsquo;s affectionate and loyal nature was the reason why he was worthy of being nurtured without sparing any effort.<br>&ldquo;Good, your affectionate and loyal nature is truly worthy of praise. In this world of martial cultivation where people deceive one another, someone like you is truly rare,&rdquo; Long Lin clapped his hands while praising.<br>&ldquo;Am I allowed to take Yao&rsquo;er away?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so anxious,&rdquo; Long Lin smiled lightly. Then, he pointed his right hand at the sealed treasure chest.<br>&ldquo;Whoosh~~~&rdquo;<br>A ray of golden light shot out from his hand. That golden light entered the treasure chest. With a bang, the golden chest opened.<br>At this moment, the eyes of Chu Feng and the others all shone. They all turned their gazes onto the treasure chest. They all wished to see exactly what was in the treasure chest.<br>Even Yao&rsquo;er reacted like this.<br>Before the many gazes, the treasure chest revealed a dazzling golden light. The dazzling golden light slowly floated upwards. The further up it floated, the stronger the golden light became. As the golden light shone, it was extremely dazzling.<br>Upon closer observation, the crowd was able to see that in the center of the golden light was a palace.<br>That palace was less than an inch in size. However, it was exquisite. It was even more exquisite, immense and impressive than an actual palace.<br>At this moment, that golden palace floated to Long Lin&rsquo;s hand. Then, he began to form a hand seal with his left hand while holding the golden palace with his right hand and chanting a strange chant.<br>His chant was spoken so fast that Chu Feng and the others were unable to determine what he was saying, much less remember it.<br>However, when the chant was spoken, the spoken words became alive. Like fireflies formed by talismans, they began to enter that golden palace nonstop.<br>With the chant and the hand seal, the golden palace on Long Lin&rsquo;s right hand started to tremble. The trembling grew more and more intense. Following that, waves of oppressive might began to emit from that palace.<br>&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; Suddenly, Long Lin raised his hand and shot the golden palace into the air. Then, the golden palace started to rapidly increase in size. In merely that blink of an eye, it turned into an enormous palace with a height of a hundred and fifty meters and a width of fifteen hundred meters that floated in midair.<br>After the palace increased in size, everything became much clearer. As it radiated with golden might and an impressive aura, the golden palace appeared to be simply incomparable.<br>&ldquo;Creak~~&rdquo;<br>At this time, the enormous palace gate started to slowly open. When the palace gate was opened, waves of rumbles began to be heard from within the palace gate.<br>It turned out to be an army. The army was coming out of the palace.<br>Upon seeing this army, the expressions on Chu Feng and the others&rsquo; faces all changed to one of shock.<br>This army was all dressed in golden armor and golden helmets and held golden spears. Their golden suits of armor were shining with glistening light, and were simply more dazzling than any golden armor that Chu Feng had seen before.<br>Even though their golden armor was very dazzling, there was no body to be seen in the armor. It was as if the golden suits of armor were alive.<br>The reason why Chu Feng and the others were shocked was not only because of this. Mainly, it was because this golden-armored army numbered a total of a thousand individuals. Furthermore, this army of a thousand all emitted the cultivation of rank one Martial Emperors.<br>A total of a thousand Martial Emperors. Even if they were all rank one Martial Emperors, this was still sufficient to cause enormous astonishment and disbelief.<br>In fact, at this moment, Elder Guan Hong, a Martial Emperor himself, was rubbing his eyes nonstop in disbelief. He was suspecting that he might be dreaming.<br>This could not be blamed on him. After all, Martial Emperor-level experts were truly too rare in the Holy Land of Martialism.<br>After all, the Cyanwood Mountain, one of the Nine Powers, when including Baili Xuankong, only possessed four Martial Emperors. As for the other Nine Powers that were slightly weaker than the Cyanwood Mountain, they might only have two Martial Emperors.<br>In fact, even for an extraordinary power like the Nangong Imperial Clan, their Martial Emperors would not even reach a hundred in number.<br>Thus, at this moment, Chu Feng and the others were deeply shocked and in fear. The scene before them was truly too stunning.<br>A total of a thousand Martial Emperors. Likely, even if all of the Martial Emperors in the Holy Land of Martialism were combined, they would not reach a thousand.<br>&ldquo;Kill!!!&rdquo;<br>Right at the moment when Chu Feng and the others were in a state of astonishment, the thousand soldiers all pointed their spears at Chu Feng and the others.<br>Once the spears were revealed, a total of a thousand golden strands of light shot forth. Like a thousand golden dragons, the golden light began to spiral about the horizon before the palace. In the end, they formed a defensive formation and blocked the area before the palace.<br>The formation was so strong that even without approaching it, one could feel a surging, intimidating oppressive might from it.<br>This oppressive might was simply too powerful. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that Baili Xuankong was here, Dugu Xingfeng and Guan Hong would&rsquo;ve been forced to step back repeatedly by the oppressive might. As for Chu Feng, a mere Half Martial Emperor, there was no need to mention what he would have felt.<br></p></div>
