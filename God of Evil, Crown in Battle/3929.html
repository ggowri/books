        <h1>Chapter 3928</h1>
        <div> - Such Change<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Trash dares to threaten me?&rdquo;<br>The nun who had received Chu Feng earlier revealed a look of displeasure.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother talking with him. Kill him and have him realize that he shouldn&rsquo;t meddle in other people&rsquo;s business in his next life.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, the other two nuns also began to speak. Not only that, but concentrated killing intent also appeared in their eyes.<br>Sure enough, all three of them were vicious and merciless.<br>Soon, the three nuns attacked Chu Feng at the same time.<br>&ldquo;Roar~~~&rdquo;<br>Their unleashed martial power turned into three ferocious beasts. With mouths wide open, the three ferocious beasts rushed forth to devour Chu Feng.<br>The three nuns planned to devour him directly using their martial skills. They weren&rsquo;t even planning to leave an intact corpse for him.<br>The three of them could be said to be truly cruel!<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right after the three ferocious martial power beasts approached Chu Feng, heaven and earth started rumbling.<br>Following that, the three ferocious martial power beasts were reduced to martial power that dispersed into thin air before Chu Feng.<br>At the same time, an extremely powerful oppressive might was unleashed from his body straight towards the three nuns.<br>Rank eight Exalted, this was Chu Feng&rsquo;s current cultivation.<br>Those three nuns were merely Heavenly Immortals.<br>At the instant when Chu Feng&rsquo;s oppressive might was unleashed, he turned into a god in their eyes, and they themselves felt that they were extremely small.<br>It was as if they were merely three little mice standing before a fierce tiger.<br>They were unable to stand firm, and were all shivering before Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Milord, we were wrong.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Milord, this lowly one was completely blind. Milord, please don&rsquo;t take offense at our actions.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that Chu Feng was actually extremely powerful, the three nuns that had planned to kill Chu Feng earlier immediately knelt on the ground.<br>The three of them were actually unable to determine what Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation was. However, they were able to tell that he was at least an Exalted-level expert. In other words, his cultivation far surpassed their own.<br>Recalling the words Chu Feng had said earlier, they all realized what he meant.<br>It turned out that the ordinary looking fellow standing before them was actually a person they could not afford to offend.<br>At that moment, the three nuns felt endless regret. Unfortunately, it was already too late.<br>&ldquo;I warned you three. Unfortunately, you failed to learn.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, the surroundings suddenly turned ice-cold.<br>&ldquo;Milord, please spare us, please spare us.&rdquo;<br>The three nuns were not only wailing, but they also began to kowtow to Chu Feng. They were truly terrified.<br>Unfortunately, Chu Feng was not moved in the slightest. Instead, he sneered in his heart.<br>What disgusted Chu Feng the most were people like them, people who bullied the weak and feared the strong, people who had no moral integrity at all.<br>Those people were completely devoid of honor and dignity towards those stronger than themselves.<br>However, when faced with those weaker than them, they would be completely devoid of conscience, and be willing to do anything.<br>In Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes, people like them were simply scum amongst cultivators.<br>&ldquo;Putt~~~&rdquo;<br>All of a sudden, Linghu Yueyue actually knelt on the ground.<br>&ldquo;Milord, please spare my three senior sisters.&rdquo;<br>Linghu Yueyue was actually begging Chu Feng for forgiveness for the three nuns that had been bullying and humiliating her.<br>When Linghu Yueyue begged him, Chu Feng retrieved his oppressive might.<br>&ldquo;Thank you Milord, thank you Milord.&rdquo;<br>The three nuns began to kowtow to Chu Feng frantically. They thought that he had decided to spare them.<br>Even Linghu Yueyue kowtowed to Chu Feng, thanking him for sparing her three senior sisters.<br>As for Chu Feng, he completely ignored the three nuns. Instead, he looked to Linghu Yueyue.<br>Seeing the current Linghu Yueyue, Chu Feng felt complicated emotions.<br>The Linghu Yueyue before him was no longer the same Linghu Yueyue he knew.<br>He didn&rsquo;t know what she'd experienced to change her into such a person.<br>However, Chu Feng was certain that whatever she'd experienced was very painful.<br>Thus, a look of determination flashed through Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes.<br>&ldquo;Wooshh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng waved his sleeve, and three strands of martial power flew out from his hand. They turned into three daggers that shot straight toward the three nuns.<br>Blood splashed three times, and the three nuns all fell to the ground. Then, they began to howl and wail in enormous pain.<br>The reason for that was because the three martial power daggers Chu Feng had sent forth were aimed at their dantians. With their dantians pierced, their cultivations were rapidly decreasing.<br>If this were to continue, their cultivations were destined to be ruined. Thus, how could they not howl in grief?<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s action had caught them off-guard. Even Linghu Yueyue was stunned.<br>She was only able to react to what had happened after some time had passed.<br>Kneeling, Linghu Yueyue crawled over to Chu Feng and began to kowtow directly before his feet.<br>&ldquo;Milord, I beg of you, please spare my three senior sisters.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I beg of you, please don&rsquo;t cripple their cultivations.&rdquo;<br>Linghu Yueyue was still begging Chu Feng to spare her senior sisters.<br>Seeing Linghu Yueyue like that, Chu Feng felt saddened and helpless. He said, &ldquo;The reason why I stopped them is because they were bullying you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, the moment they intended to kill me, the matter was no longer related to you. Instead, it became something between them and I.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d already told them to not attack me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That was not a warning. Instead, it was their final chance. If they'd listened to me, then regardless of what they might do in the future, I would still spare them this once.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, the moment they attacked me, they chose their outcome.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, if my cultivation was weaker than theirs, I would&rsquo;ve died.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I'd died, it would have been all because of you. It would have been because I&rsquo;d decided to uphold justice and help you. Because of that, I&rsquo;d have provoked them, and been silenced.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet, you&rsquo;re actually begging me to forgive them? Do you not think you&rsquo;re letting me down?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>Hearing those words, Linghu Yueyue suddenly stood, stunned.<br></p></div>
