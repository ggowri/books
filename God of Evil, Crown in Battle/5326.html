        <h1>Chapter 5327</h1>
        <div>: We&rsquo;re Staying Together No Matter What<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not lying. It doesn&rsquo;t take much effort for me to acquire the formation&rsquo;s energy for you,&rdquo; Chu Feng emphasized.<br>&ldquo;Very well then.&rdquo;<br>The white-haired woman followed Chu Feng&rsquo;s instructions and began constructing a formation inside his body.<br>At the same time, Chu Feng also started constructing another formation to serve as a medium to direct the energy from the wall formation into the white-haired woman&rsquo;s body. The process would take a bit longer, but in return, the white-haired woman could obtain power comparable to a rank one True God level cultivator.<br>There were restrictions imposed on the formation&rsquo;s energy that prevented them from utilizing their own skills, limiting their offensive means and fighting prowess. This appeared to be an intentional capping measure to increase the difficulty of the trials.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go. Proceed carefully.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng began making his way over the abyss; Bai Yunqing and the white-haired woman followed closely behind. They remained vigilant while flying across the abyss, but to their surprise, not a single monstrous beast rose from the abyss to block their path.<br>Thanks to that, they were able to reach the other end of the abyss without any trouble. All three of them, including the white-haired woman, heaved sighs of relief upon landing on the ground.<br>The monstrous beasts lurking in the fog were definitely not pushovers. While the three of them currently wielded prowess comparable to rank one True God level cultivators, it was not enough to guarantee that they would be able to defeat the monstrous beasts.<br>It was truly fortunate that they were able to pass through the abyss without having to clash with the monstrous beasts.<br>On the other side of the abyss was a huge gate that boasted a height of ten thousand meters. The gate didn&rsquo;t have any formations imbued on it, but there was a keyhole. Clearly, they would have to find the key if they wished to open the gate.<br>The problem was that they were surrounded by nothing but cliff walls. There was nothing that resembled a key here.<br>All of a sudden, Bai Yunqing thought of something and nervously turned to Chu Feng. &ldquo;Big brother, it can&rsquo;t be possible that the key is inside the abyss, right?&rdquo;<br>There was a tip back at the very first formation that they would encounter a gate that would block their path. If they wished to pass through the gate, they would have to venture into the heart of danger.<br>&ldquo;Yes, this is probably the difficult trial mentioned in the formation.&rdquo; Chu Feng agreed with Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s judgment.<br>The &lsquo;heart of danger&rsquo; likely referred to the abyss.<br>They thought that they were lucky to have passed through the abyss without encountering any monstrous beasts, but who could have thought that the trial would require them to dive right in?<br>I knew that the final test couldn&rsquo;t possibly be this easy.<br>&ldquo;Wait for me here,&rdquo; Chu Feng said before heading into the abyss.<br>He was planning to find the key alone. Knowing how dangerous the abyss was, he didn&rsquo;t want to expose Bai Yunqing and the white-haired woman to the threats that lurked in there.<br>Shoosh!<br>Shoosh!<br>But barely after Chu Feng dived into the fog, two figures followed him in. They were the white-haired woman and Bai Yunqing.<br>Chu Feng was still thinking of dissuading them from their decision, but the white-haired woman interjected before he could say anything, &ldquo;Since we have decided to become a team, we should stay together no matter what we encounter.&rdquo;<br>Those words filled Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart with warmth.<br>&ldquo;I agree with Miss Bai,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing chirped in with a grin.<br>&ldquo;You bunch sure are a handful to deal with.&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head with a helpless smile.<br>Once again, it would appear that his eye for people was spot-on. The white-haired woman and Bai Yunqing were indeed people who were worth befriending.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s prepare for battle then,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he manifested a formation sword in his grasp.<br>Bai Yunqing and the white-haired woman did the same too. The formation&rsquo;s power had granted them identical means, almost as if they were from the same lineage.<br>Grar!<br>A furious roar suddenly dispersed the surrounding fog. A gigantic beast covered in a green aura surged from the abyss. It was a centipede that spanned a length of a thousand meters, and it was charging right at Chu Feng and the others.<br>This centipede was only at mid Half-God level, which meant that Chu Feng and the others could have easily dealt with it even without the formation&rsquo;s power.<br>Chu Feng swung his sword, releasing a surge of sword qi that sliced the centipede into half. Within moments, the centipede&rsquo;s carcass dissipated into a wisp of gas.<br>Knowing that these monstrous beasts were conjured by a formation, Chu Feng and the others weren&rsquo;t surprised at all. It only showed how skillful the world spiritist who had constructed this formation was to make everything so lifelike.<br>Seconds later, the dispersed wisp of gas suddenly converged to form an orb.<br>Bai Yunqing grabbed the orb, and the three of them gathered together to examine it. It was only the size of a tiny bead, but astonishingly, it contained a small realm that was filled to the brim with a green aura.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing asked in confusion.<br>&ldquo;It looks like a phenomenon,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&lsquo;A phenomenon? What is its use?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No idea. Let&rsquo;s continue exploring.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng stowed away the orb and continued ahead. They encountered more monstrous beasts of varying levels of strength along the way, but every single one of them would morph into an orb containing a realm filled with a phenomenon upon death.<br>The stronger the monstrous beast was, the stronger the phenomenon contained within its orb. These orbs could also be merged together with each other. There would be no change in their physical sizes, but the phenomena they contained would become much more potent.<br>These phenomena likely had their own uses later on.<br>Shoosh!<br>A massive claw suddenly shot out of the fog and swiped down on Chu Feng and the others. It happened so fast that the three of them barely had enough time to release their spirit power to protect themselves.<br>Despite their timely defensive maneuver, the strength of the claw was so great that the three of them were pushed back.<br>The culprit was a repulsive monstrous beast that resembled a hybrid between an octopus and a spider. It was around a thousand meters tall, and it had numerous tentacles that were covered in black hair.<br>What was most disgusting about this monstrous beast was the head of a human boy growing out of its octopus body. The boy&rsquo;s eyes were closed, as if he was sleeping.<br>In contrast, the octopus monstrous beast was already unleashing a tremendous killing intent from the moment of its appearance. Seeing that its first attack had failed to down its enemies, it furiously flung its tentacles to release a flurry of wind blades at Chu Feng and the others.<br>Chu Feng and the others tightened their grips on their blades and launched their counterattack.<br>The octopus monstrous beast was a terrifying adversary that wielded the strength of a rank one True God level cultivator, and its fighting prowess was incredible. Even with Chu Feng, Bai Yunqing, and the white-haired woman joining hands against it, it still took them quite a bit of effort to bring it down.<br>Chu Feng was thankful that Bai Yunqing and the white-haired woman had decided to tag along, or else it would have taken him much longer to defeat the octopus monstrous beast alone.<br>In particular, the white-haired woman was an extremely proficient fighter who didn&rsquo;t pale too much in comparison with Chu Feng. She was a great aid throughout the fight.<br>Surprisingly, the octopus monstrous beast morphed into a one-meter-tall crystal statue of a boy instead of an orb. This statue had the same face as the boy who was lodged inside the octopus monstrous beast&rsquo;s body, be it its closed eyes or appearance. The statue was unclothed, and its body was covered in runes.<br>One small portion of the runes was glowing, but the rest of it was dull.<br>Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing examined the runes, hoping to figure out the significance of the boy statue.<br>Moments later, after partially deciphering the runes, Bai Yunqing looked at Chu Feng in astonishment and asked, &ldquo;Is this the key?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, it is the key. However, we&rsquo;ll have to use the phenomenon orbs to light up all of the runes and awaken it first before we can use it to open the gate,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s partially lit because we have already obtained some phenomenon beads?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, we&rsquo;ll need a lot of phenomenon beads to awaken this statue. Shall we split up?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing suggested.<br>The phenomenon orbs they had acquired thus far had only lit up a small portion of the statue, which meant that they still had a long way to go. To heighten their efficiency, it would be best for them to split up and hunt separately.<br>Chu Feng nodded in agreement before reminding them, &ldquo;Be careful. Don&rsquo;t confront any True God level monstrous beasts alone. We&rsquo;ll gather in front of the gate once every two hours.&rdquo;<br>The fog had a property that hindered their senses, preventing them from communicating with each other once they were a distance apart. The best solution was for them to gather in front of the gate once in a while.<br>&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo; Bai Yunqing turned around and left.<br>Chu Feng and the white-haired woman did the same too.<br>Every two hours, they would leave the fog and gather outside the gate, where they would pass their phenomenon orbs to Chu Feng. It was just that the statue needed so many phenomenon orbs that it took the three of them forty-four hours just to light up half of it.<br>It was only after the forty-sixth hour that the boy statue was finally fully lit up, which meant that they could finally awaken the statue with their phenomenon orbs. All they had to do now was to gather their phenomenon orbs together and unleash the phenomena on the statue.<br>Chu Feng returned to the gate and saw that the white-haired woman was there.<br>When the white-haired woman passed her orbs to Chu Feng, he knew straight away that they had gathered sufficient phenomena to awaken the statue, but he decided to wait for Bai Yunqing to return first.<br>It didn&rsquo;t take long for Bai Yunqing to return, but he was injured. On top of that, he was bound by treasures that prevented him from moving and speaking. He was only able to return because someone else was with him&mdash;Zhou Dong.<br>The faces of Chu Feng and the white-haired woman darkened.<br>Zhou Dong was also imbued with the formation&rsquo;s power, meaning that he also wielded the strength of a rank one True God level cultivator.<br></div>
