        <h1>Chapter 5629: Saint-tier Elder’s Mission</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a majestic palace, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master had received the report he wanted, but his eyes lingered on a person&rsquo;s profile for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you again, Chu Feng. It looks like this entrance examination is going to be interesting.&rdquo; The eyes of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master gleamed with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pushed open the palace doors. A large number of experts were kneeling in wait for him outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s </span><span>Qinghe</span><span>?&rdquo; the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master called out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Lord Mansion Master, I am here,&rdquo; a white-haired elder stepped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the white-haired elder who had spied on Chu Feng together with the black-haired elder not too long ago. In truth, he was no ordinary person. His full name was Ling </span><span>Qinghe</span><span>, and he was one of the 36 Saint-tier Elders of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, Saint-tier elders were second only to the grand elder, making them extremely powerful figures in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span>?&rdquo; the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master called out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Lord Mansion Master, I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo; A plump elder with a huge belly stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was Jie </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span>. Not only was he only the 36 Saint-tier Elders, but he was also the one in charge of the entrance examination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master waved his sleeves, and two scrolls fell into Ling </span><span>Qinghe</span><span> and Jie </span><span>Zhenfu&rsquo;s</span><span> hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Look at it a day before the entrance examination commences,&rdquo; the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master said before returning to the palace, leaving the crowd kneeling in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd looked at the scrolls, whereas Elder </span><span>Qinghe</span><span> and Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> exchanged heavy looks. They wouldn&rsquo;t dare to make light of an order from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master, which was why they were worried about the content of their mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chen Hui continued to improve in the days to come. By the last day, his harvested crops could already be exchanged for a hundred World Spiritist Pearls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Chu Feng&rsquo;s record remained at 110 World Spiritist Pearls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chen Hui, you have improved a lot. What a pity there&rsquo;s only a single Heaven-tier World Spiritist Pearl,&rdquo; the elder lamented as he handed Chen Hui his World Spiritist </span><span>Pearls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, does only the first place get a reward?&rdquo; Chen Hui asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; the elder replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;The ranking is based on the quality of the crops, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It looks like the first place belongs to Chu Feng then.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The quality of the crops directly correlated to the number of World Spiritist Pearls one received. Chen Hui knew that he hadn&rsquo;t grasped the secret as thoroughly as Chu Feng yet, so he was certain that the latter would be in the first place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Tomorrow morning, some of you will get a ranking slip. The person in the first place will receive a Heaven-tier World Spiritist Pearl as a reward. Tomorrow afternoon, the entrance examination will officially commence. Only those who have received a ranking slip will be qualified to participate in the entrance examination,&rdquo; the elder said instead of answering the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elder was about to take his leave when he noticed the barrier and halted his footsteps. With a wave of his sleeves, he shattered Chu Feng&rsquo;s barrier. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to keep this anymore since you&rsquo;re going to leave this place. It&rsquo;s not a bad thing to get acquainted with more people.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Chu Feng with a meaningful smile before taking his leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It looks like the elder wishes more people to witness your moment of triumph when you are declared to be in the first place,&rdquo; Chen Hui walked up to Chu Feng as he said with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;The result isn&rsquo;t decided yet,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It can only be you, unless someone pulls some strings. But again, this is a trial from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. They are looking out for true talents. Who would dare tamper with the results?&rdquo; Chen Hui asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;There might be other formidable juniors too,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;A junior more formidable than you? I don&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo; Chen Hui&rsquo;s confidence in Chu Feng was unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng could only smile in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The following day, a huge crowd had gathered around Chu Feng&rsquo;s agricultural field before daybreak. Previously, they dared not to linger in the area due to the isolation barrier. It was only after hearing that the elder had shattered the barrier that they dared to head over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had heard about the rumors, and they thought that Chu Feng was the likeliest person to clinch the first place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several streaks of light flashed across the barely lit sky and flew right into the hands of a few people. They were scrolls. Those who received the scrolls couldn&rsquo;t conceal their excitement, whereas those who didn&rsquo;t receive one either stared at the horizon with nervous looks or lowered their heads in disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s elders had informed them that only those who had received a scroll could participate in the entrance examination in the afternoon, which meant that those who didn&rsquo;t receive a scroll had been eliminated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not Chu Feng?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was taken aback when they saw the ranking in the scroll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First place: Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Second place: Chu Feng</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Third place: Chen Hui</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span>? He&rsquo;s in the first place?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was taken aback. They had heard about Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span>, which was why they knew that the World Spiritist Pearls he had received for his crops were much lower than Chu Feng&rsquo;s.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Damn it! I didn&rsquo;t think that there would be corruption in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s trial too. If that&rsquo;s the case, it&rsquo;s not worth entering the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion at all,&rdquo; Chen Hui bellowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chen Hui, how dare you doubt the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion!&rdquo; a voice bellowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd immediately zipped up their mouths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person who had spoken up was none other than the young master of the Immortal Spirit Manor, Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span>. He was accompanied by Song Yuping, who looked at Chu Feng with a gleeful smile and provocative eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span>, how much did you spend to get the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s&rsquo; elders to tamper with the results? It can&rsquo;t that you offered your junior to them, did you?&rdquo; Chen Hui scoffed aloud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re courting death!&rdquo; Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao&rsquo;s</span><span> face darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He released a powerful burst of spirit power that quickly manifested as a sharp formation sword that flew straight for Chen Hui. The sword was small, but its prowess was formidable. The crowd could sense his fearsome prowess as a Gold Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the formation sword could reach Chen Hui, Chu Feng stood forward and dispelled the sword with a casual wave of his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be an exciting battle.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd&rsquo;s interest was roused. They had heard that Chu Feng was a Gold Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist too, and a battle between two Gold Dragon God-cloak World Spiritists was bound to be exciting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you going to butt into this matter?&rdquo; Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> asked, but there was an excited gleam in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had known from the start that the crowd wouldn&rsquo;t easily accept the ranking, but he could silence most people as long as he proved that he was superior to Chu Feng by pummeling the latter. He planned to shatter the crowd&rsquo;s skepticism with raw strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of a sudden, his face paled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng had suddenly appeared in front of him as if he was a specter. Before he could react, Chu Feng hurled out a punch straight for his abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This strike sent Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> crashing into the agricultural fields, raising up a cloud of dust and rice. A huge pit was left in his wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd rose into the sky to look at the pit, and they saw Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> lying in the </span><span>dead middle of it. He was in a pathetic state; his robes were torn, and fresh blood kept seeping from the corners of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng had inflicted severe injuries on him with a single punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was stunned. They couldn&rsquo;t believe there was such a huge difference between the two Gold Dragon God-cloak World Spiritists. This was different from what they had expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>You</span><span> despicable scum! How dare you launch a surprise assault on my senior? You&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Song Yuping pointed her finger at Chu Feng and berated him, but she was quickly silenced. Chu Feng had grabbed her by her throat and raised her high into the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stand right here. Tell your senior to save you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said. He turned to Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> and asked, &ldquo;Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span>, can you get up?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Hah! Are you challenging me right now? There&rsquo;s no way you could have hurt me if not for your surprise assault!&rdquo; Refusing to accept the result, Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> pushed himself to his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng released a whiff of oppressive might that crushed Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> back onto the ground. Needless to say, this oppression originated from Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This further astonished the crowd. They sensed that Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power had surpassed the limits of a Gold Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It looks like your senior can&rsquo;t save you anymore,&rdquo; Chu Feng told Song Yuping.</span></p></div>
