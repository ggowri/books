        <div> - The Furious Liangqiu<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Since you&rsquo;re already here, you shouldn&rsquo;t be leaving.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt furious upon thinking that the chaotic state of mind that he was in earlier was caused by those things.<br>Thus, he began to use his ability to refine those insect-like things; that strange power that had filled his body.<br>At the beginning, Chu Feng had no idea what sort of power those things possessed.<br>He merely complied with the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s suggestion and decided to refine them because he had told him to.<br>However, upon refining the insects, Chu Feng felt completely shocked.<br>After refining the bugs, not only was Chu Feng&rsquo;s body filled with boundless spirit power, but a great amount of information was also rushing into Chu Feng&rsquo;s brain.<br>In fact, he was even able to gain some comprehension from them.<br>He gained&hellip; the comprehension to increase his spirit power and link to Snake Mark Saint-cloak Spirit Power.<br>Unfortunately, the amount of insects were not sufficient. Before Chu Feng could gain more comprehension, the insects were all refined.<br>Chu Feng felt that if there were more of such strange powers, he might be able to make a breakthrough to Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.<br>Noticing that Chu Feng had already refined the power, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist removed his palm from Chu Feng&rsquo;s forehead.<br>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you the Mirror Core is a very dangerous place, that you should not go down there?&rdquo; The Ox-nosed Old Daoist said to Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng noticed that only him and Ox-nosed Old Daoist were outside the Mirror Core, and Grandmaster Liangqiu was nowhere to be seen.<br>Likely, Grandmaster Liangqiu had returned to the surface because he was unable to withstand the pressure from that place.<br>That said, Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s whereabouts were not important. What Chu Feng was concerned about was what the strange parasite-like powers that had entered his body unknowingly were.<br>&ldquo;Senior, that power in my body was extremely strange. Exactly what is it?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;That is the power of the Mirror Core, a power that can make world spiritists stronger. However, the current you is still unable to withstand that sort of power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t help you, you would&rsquo;ve been devoured by that power, either turning into a puppet or dying from self-detonation,&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;But, wasn&rsquo;t that Mirror Core only the formation core of the Mirror Sea?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why would there be such a strange power there?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Formation core? Don&rsquo;t listen to Liangqiu&rsquo;s nonsense, the Mirror Core is much more complicated than you imagine it to be,&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;In that case, exactly what sort of place is the Mirror Core?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s meaningless for me to explain things to you right now. Thus, don&rsquo;t ask about it anymore,&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Senior, that senior Zhu&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that he has already been eroded by that power?&rdquo;<br>Having experienced it himself, Chu Feng knew how terrifying the Mirror Core was.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng became even more worried about old man Zhu.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, he is alive and kicking. It&rsquo;s impossible for him to be dead,&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t die? Senior, how do you know that?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to know how I know that, you should instead concern yourself with your own business. Do you now believe that you are unable to save him with your strength?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Earlier, if it wasn&rsquo;t for this old man rescuing you, you would&rsquo;ve died already,&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng felt very pained.<br>He truly wanted to go and save old man Zhu. However, he knew that he was also truly powerless to do anything.<br>It was as the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had said, if it wasn&rsquo;t for him rescuing Chu Feng earlier, he would&rsquo;ve died there.<br>However, Chu Feng was only at the outermost region of the Mirror Core. He was still very far from reaching the depths.<br>When he could not even contend against the power at the outermost region, how exactly was he supposed to rescue old man Zhu?<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame yourself. Follow me out first.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Should you be willing to go out with me, this old man will immediately bring you out,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said all of a sudden.<br>&ldquo;But, senior, you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng noticed that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s condition was not very good either.<br>This was not merely caused by him coming to Chu Feng&rsquo;s aid. This revealed that the Mirror Core&rsquo;s power was also capable of affecting the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist didn&rsquo;t wish for Chu Feng to take risks. Naturally, Chu Feng also did not wish for the Ox-nosed Old Daoist to risk his life for him.<br>&ldquo;Enough with the buts. You&rsquo;ll understand once we go out.&rdquo;<br>After he finished saying those words, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist grabbed Chu Feng&rsquo;s shoulder and shot straight for the sea&rsquo;s surface.<br>&ldquo;Clamor~~~&rdquo;<br>Water splashed into the sky. Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had returned to the surface.<br>Sure enough, Grandmaster Liangqiu was waiting there.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you alright?&rdquo;<br>Seeing Chu Feng, Grandmaster Liangqiu hurriedly rushed forth.<br>&ldquo;Alright? Ask him yourself. If it wasn&rsquo;t for me going down there to save him, he would&rsquo;ve died,&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>Grandmaster Liangqiu was naturally able to tell that Chu Feng&rsquo;s health was extremely weak right now.<br>He was feeling very pained to see Chu Feng like that. Now, after hearing what the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said, he felt even more pained.<br>If he hadn&rsquo;t informed Chu Feng of that seventy-nine day appointment, he wouldn&rsquo;t have taken such risks.<br>&ldquo;Senior, I am truly sorry. This junior was unable to save senior Zhu,&rdquo; Chu Feng had an ashamed look on his face.<br>&ldquo;Enough with the senior Zhu, that person simply wanted to kill you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my first time encountering someone like that. It&rsquo;s one thing to kill oneself, but he actually wanted to drag others down with him. That person simply does not possess the demeanor of a senior in the slightest," the Ox-nosed Old Daoist spoke with an extremely mocking tone.<br>&ldquo;Senior, please don&rsquo;t say it like that. After all, senior Zhu only entered the Mirror Core in order to save me,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Save you? Pah! The person who saved you is this old man. If it wasn&rsquo;t for this old man, you and that Chu Xuanzhengfa would simply not have been able to escape from the Gate of Death. He is nothing more than a swindler.&rdquo; The Ox-nosed Old Daoist did not exercise any restraint. Instead, his attitude turned even more vile.<br>&ldquo;Ox-nose, you simply do not know what brother Zhu has done. Thus, you&rsquo;d best be more respectful when speaking of him.&rdquo; At that moment, Grandmaster Liangqiu, who was already in a bad mood, revealed a look of anger on his face.<br>&ldquo;Respectful? That so-called brother Zhu of yours is not a good man at all," the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said with a mocking look.<br>&ldquo;Since when did someone as vile as you became qualified to speak ill of my brother Zhu?!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Grandmaster Liangqiu let out a shout. Not only did he release his rank one Exalted oppressive might, but he even raised his fist and shot it toward the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Paaa~~~&rdquo;<br>However, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist raised his hand and effortlessly blocked Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s fist.<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Grandmaster Liangqiu was stunned. According to his memory, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s cultivation should be far inferior to his own. It should be impossible for him to block his punch.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist burst into loud laughter.<br>Grandmaster Liangqiu was completely baffled by his laughter. At the same time, he became even more furious. Angrily, he asked, &ldquo;What are you laughing about?!&rdquo;<br></p></div>
