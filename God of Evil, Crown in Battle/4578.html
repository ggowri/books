        <h1>Chapter 4577</h1>
        <div>: The Final Ranking<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Along with the dissipation of the Storm Combat Dragon Ring, a massive spirit formation gate appeared at the peak of the mountain.<br>The spirit formation gate swiftly sucked all of the juniors in to bring them out of this place.<br>&ldquo;Little friend, may we meet again.&rdquo;<br>But just as Chu Feng was about to leave, a powerful but familiar voice sounded in Chu Feng&rsquo;s ear.<br>It was the ice dragon.<br>Chu Feng took a look at the others beside him, but it appeared that he was the only one who could hear the voice of the ice dragon.<br>He wanted to respond to the ice dragon, but he was unable to sense where the ice dragon was or even perceive its presence at all. Due to that, he was unable to respond at all.<br>&ldquo;Was the ice dragon a real existence?&rdquo;<br>This was not the first time that Chu Feng was wondering if the ice dragon was not just a mere manifestation of the formation, and that earlier remark further deepened his doubts.<br>In truth, it was not uncommon for cultivators to use real creatures to guard their formations. However, this was the first time Chu Feng was seeing an existence as powerful as an ice dragon guarding a formation.<br>If the ice dragon was truly a real existence, it would mean that the Rampaging Storm Clan was indeed a terrifying strong power back in those days.<br>At the very least, the Holy Light Clan couldn&rsquo;t even hold a candle to them.<br>In any case, after Chu Feng and the others left the world, the Storm Combat Dragon Ring swiftly reverted back to its initial appearance.<br>Looking at the Storm Combat Dragon Ring once more now, no one could have possibly imagined that an entire world was actually hiding within it.<br>That being said, no one had the attention to marvel at the mystical nature of the Storm Combat Dragon Ring now either. At this very moment, all eyes were gathered onto Chu Feng.<br>This was the young man who had guarded the dignity of the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>Had it not been for him, the black-robed man would have been able to walk away triumphantly after crushing all of them. If so, the Holy Light Galaxy&rsquo;s reputation would have been utterly ruined.<br>&ldquo;To think that he can remain calm in the face of such a situation, it looks like he&rsquo;s quite a mature individual too. I didn&rsquo;t think that such a junior could have appeared in our Holy Light Galaxy. This is truly a joyous occasion!&rdquo;<br>Looking at how Chu Feng was able to remain calm despite being in the limelight, those from the older generation felt even more pleased with him.<br>Shoosh shoosh shoosh!<br>All of a sudden, brilliant light shone from the horizon.<br>Taking a closer look, a huge surge of purple light that cloaked the entire sky was swiftly approaching them. It was some sort of purple aura.<br>Niantian Energy.<br>The Niantian Energy swiftly diverged into innumerable surges as they dived into the bodies of those who had placed their bets earlier.<br>However, the amount earned varied from person to person.<br>If the Niantian Energy that most people obtained was just the size of a worm, the amount that Chu Feng, Yu Lie, Long Xiaoxiao, and the others obtained could be compared to that of a massive dragon.<br>Of course, it went without saying that Chu Feng obtained the greatest share of Niantian Energy of all.<br>When the massive amount of Niantian Energy seeped into Chu Feng&rsquo;s body, everyone directed looks of envy over.<br>However, they also knew that Chu Feng deserved it too. After all, he was the person who had induced a phenomenon in the Niantian Gambling Formation.<br>They might have doubted his capability back then, but right now, they knew that there was no one more deserving than him.<br>&ldquo;The Niantian Energy actually flew over on its own accord?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It looks like Daoist Niantian really has high regard for young friend Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Speaking of which, where&rsquo;s Daoist Niantian?&rdquo;<br>A commotion broke out amidst the crowd.<br>One must know that the rewards of the Niantian Gambling Formation usually required the participants of the gamble to head back to the formation in order to receive their prizes.<br>This was the first time around that the prizes of the Niantian Gambling Formation had taken the initiative to bestow the rewards upon those who had gambled right.<br>Everyone attributed this to the special care that Daoist Niantian was showering upon Chu Feng.<br>Putting all things aside, it was Daoist Niantian who first stood forward and supported Chu Feng at the very start. All of this showed that the two of them were close to one another.<br>But all of a sudden, the commotion died down.<br>A powerhouse was currently making his way toward Chu Feng.<br>He was no other than the strongest expert of the Holy Light Galaxy, the Holy Light Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Shengguang Xuanye!<br>&ldquo;Junior Chu Feng pays respects to Lord Xuanye,&rdquo; Chu Feng quickly clasped his fist and greeted the other party.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you may spare with the formalities. You have done all of us proud today. Allow this old man to thank you on behalf of the Holy Light Galaxy.&rdquo;<br>Shockingly, Shengguang Xuanye, despite his lofty standing, actually bowed deeply to Chu Feng before everyone else.<br>Never in their lifetime had they ever thought that Shengguang Xuanye would actually bow to a junior. Was Chu Feng so strong to the extent that even Shengguang Xuanye didn&rsquo;t dare to disrespect him anymore?<br>&ldquo;Lord Xuanye, please don&rsquo;t do this. I&rsquo;m unworthy of it.&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Xuanye&rsquo;s action left Chu Feng at a loss as to what to do.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re definitely worthy of my bow. If not for you, our Holy Light Galaxy would have been thoroughly humiliated by that black-robed man,&rdquo; Shengguang Xuanye said as he patted Chu Feng&rsquo;s shoulders.<br>He looked at Chu Feng with gentle eyes filled with appreciation.<br>The two of them proceeded on to chat for a long while.<br>Judging from the amiable atmosphere between the two of them, everyone could sense that Shengguang Xuanye had a high view of Chu Feng.<br>Seeing that Shengguang Xuanye bore no hostility toward Chu Feng, everyone heaved a sigh of relief.<br>Following that, Shengguang Xuanye went on to announce the renewed rankings of the tournament.<br>Needless to say, the first place of the tournament went no other than to Chu Feng. Everyone else had their rankings pushed back by one rank.<br>Long Xiaoxiao was moved to rank two, Yu Lie to rank three&hellip;<br>And Yin Buyu, who was previously in rank ten, and pushed down to rank eleven too.<br>Following that, Chu Feng, Long Xiaoxiao, and the others received an invitation from Shengguang Xuanye to head to the residences of the Holy Light Clan in the Storm Realm.<br>Naturally, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Cloudsky Immortal Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster, and the other powerhouses were all invited too.<br>However, others like Long Daozhi, Gu Mingyuan, Chu Lingxi, and the others didn&rsquo;t have the chance to tag along. They could only watch as Chu Feng boarded the warship of the Holy Light Clan together with Shengguang Xuanye before departing the area.<br>Nevertheless, there was a proud smile on their lips. They had watched Chu Feng as he grew up, and they knew that it wasn&rsquo;t easy for him to have come this far.<br>But as soon as the Holy Light Clan&rsquo;s warship departed from the area, the faces of Gu Mingyuan, Long Daozhi, and the others immediately darkened. They looked at one another with unease on their faces.<br>&ldquo;You received young friend Chu Feng&rsquo;s voice transmission too?&rdquo; Long Daozhi asked Gu Mingyuan discreetly through voice transmission.<br>&ldquo;City Master Long, did you receive it too?&rdquo; Gu Mingyuan responded in the same discreet manner.<br>&ldquo;Yes, I did.&rdquo;<br>After hearing those words, a tight frown appeared on Gu Mingyuan&rsquo;s forehead.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s words had left her feeling deeply unnerved.<br>He told her to take Chu Lingxi away and hide up. In fact, it was best if they could leave the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>This made her realize that something bad was going to happen very soon&hellip;<br></p></div>
