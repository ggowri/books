        <h1>Chapter 5330</h1>
        <div>: Yuan Jiang Appears, the Truth Surfaces<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand and sword were crackling with the same lightning that was currently decimating Zhou Dong&rsquo;s body.<br>&ldquo;My gosh! Big brother Chu Feng, what did you do?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing stared at Chu Feng in disbelief.<br>As a rank four Half-God level cultivator, Chu Feng actually managed to severely wound Zhou Dong, a rank six Half-God level cultivator!<br>At the same time, Eggy severely berated him &ldquo;Chu Feng, are you out of your mind?&rdquo;<br>She knew that Chu Feng had just executed the second slash of the Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes, but he was not supposed to execute that skill anymore as it could cost him his life.<br>&ldquo;You bastard! I&rsquo;ll remember this!&rdquo;<br>Zhou Dong shot Chu Feng a vicious glare before escaping via a spirit formation gate. As indignant as he felt, he had no choice but to make an escape as Chu Feng&rsquo;s earlier attack had rendered him powerless.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>The white-haired woman anxiously swooped down to support Chu Feng, who nearly collapsed onto the ground. Even so, his Immemorial Hero&rsquo;s Sword slipped from his hand with a loud clang. He didn&rsquo;t even have the strength to hold his sword anymore.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, what&rsquo;s wrong? Are you suffering from a backlash?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing also rushed over and worriedly asked.<br>&ldquo;Mm.&rdquo; Chu Feng could barely summon the strength to nod his head.<br>The backlash from the Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes was coming much faster and stronger than before. It was beyond his means to withstand.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, hurry up and swallow this. This can alleviate the pain of your backlash.&rdquo; Bai Yunqing took out a pill and gave it to Chu Feng.<br>It was a pill that was similar to the one Bai Yunqing had eaten back then to alleviate his backlash, just that the one he was offering Chu Feng now was clearly much more potent. Despite not bearing to eat this pill back then, he was actually offering it to Chu Feng right now.<br>&ldquo;I have some too.&rdquo; The white-haired woman took out two pills that were identical to Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s.<br>Bai Yunqing was stunned to see the pills. Words lingered at the tip of his tongue, but he decided against voicing them aloud.<br>Chu Feng swallowed the three pills, and powerful recovery energy enveloped his body. He turned to the gate, and the imprint on his forehead started to glow. It manifested into a ray of light that shot into the gate&rsquo;s keyhole.<br>Crrrk!<br>The tightly-shut gates began to open, revealing a spirit formation gate.<br>Wuu!<br>However, Chu Feng&rsquo;s condition only continued to worsen.<br>&ldquo;Even three divine pills aren&rsquo;t enough to alleviate his backlash? How severe is his backlash?!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing was so anxious that his body was trembling. It was finally sinking in for him how bad Chu Feng&rsquo;s condition was.<br>The white-haired woman didn&rsquo;t say a word, but her expression had visibly stiffened. She hadn&rsquo;t thought that Chu Feng would put his life on the line to save her.<br>&ldquo;Bring him out first. The Ancient Realm might have ways to heal him,&rdquo; the white-haired woman said.<br>The two of them carried Chu Feng into the spirit formation gate, which transported them back to the square. The square was surprisingly empty. The crowd had mostly dispersed, leaving just the Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief and the elders here.<br>Jia Chengying and Qin Shu were here too, though Zhou Dong was nowhere to be seen.<br>&ldquo;Waa, what&rsquo;s wrong with Chu Feng? Is he dying?&rdquo; Jia Chengying burst into laughter.<br>Qin Shu didn&rsquo;t say a word, but a gleeful smile could be seen on his face.<br>The white-haired woman was in no mood to bother with these two clowns. She turned to the Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief and asked, &ldquo;Elder, please save Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>The Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief walked up to Chu Feng, but instead of healing him right away, he gazed at Chu Feng&rsquo;s forehead instead.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s young hero Chu Feng who cleared the final test after all?&rdquo; the Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief asked.<br>&ldquo;Yes, but he used some kind of power that resulted in a severe backlash. Hurry up and save him!&rdquo; the white-haired woman urged.<br>Eyy!<br>The Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief sighed in lamentation. He took out an exquisite box that resembled a precious treasure, but what was contained inside the box was an ordinary stone. As he picked up the stone, his eyes and the stone in his hand began to emit a mysterious glow.<br>He then placed the glowing stone on Chu Feng&rsquo;s forehead before forcefully pulling it upward.<br>Gah!<br>Chu Feng, who was on the verge of passing out, suddenly cried in pain.<br>A ray of light had formed between Chu Feng&rsquo;s forehead and the stone. It looked like an attempt to extract the imprint that had formed on Chu Feng&rsquo;s forehead after absorbing the boy earlier in the final test.<br>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;<br>The white-haired woman sensed that something was amiss. Rather than helping Chu Feng, the Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief appeared to be doing something detrimental to him. She tried to stop him, but a powerful oppressive might held her and Bai Yunqing in place.<br>&ldquo;What are you doing? Let me go! Do you want to die?&rdquo; the white-haired woman roared.<br>&ldquo;Let go of my big brother! Don&rsquo;t you know that my master is the First Guest Elder of the Totem Dragon Clan? I won&rsquo;t let you off if you dare to hurt my big brother!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing spewed threats.<br>The Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief ignored Bai Yunqing, though he turned toward the white-haired woman and said, &ldquo;Miss Bai, I don&rsquo;t want to offend you. I have a high opinion of young friend Chu Feng as well. But&hellip; this matter concerns the fate of our Ancient Realm. I have no choice.&rdquo;<br>It turned out that words had appeared in the empty stone monuments inside the palace, foretelling the end of the Ancient Realm. To stop the calamity, they had to strip off the benefit received by the person who cleared the final test.<br>The Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief had no idea how this had anything to do with the impending calamity, but he unconditionally trusted the advice coming from the stone monument. He couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder what Chu Feng had to do with their Ancient Realm&rsquo;s calamity, and a possibility surfaced in his mind.<br>The Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief looked at Chu Feng with cold eyes and asked, &ldquo;You are his descendant, aren&rsquo;t you? You&rsquo;re here because he discovered something back then, am I right? Are you planning to bring our Ancient Realm to ruins?&rdquo;<br>He had long noticed that Chu Feng resembled Chu Xuanyan, which led to him speculating that Chu Feng was Chu Xuanyan&rsquo;s descendant. It was just that Chu Xuanyan hadn&rsquo;t done anything detrimental to their Ancient Realm&mdash;instead, he helped them with their Ancestral Ritual&mdash;so he didn&rsquo;t bear any ill-will toward him.<br>But the words on the stone monument clearly hinted that Chu Feng was a dangerous individual, which forced them to rethink their previous views of him. As a result, all kinds of conspiracy theories about why he came to the Ancient Realm surfaced.<br>They suspected that Chu Feng had come to the Ancient Realm to do something sinister based on the information he had acquired from Chu Xuanyan.<br>&ldquo;What are you saying? I don&rsquo;t understand what you&rsquo;re getting at,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied through clenched jaws.<br>How could he know what they were getting at when he had only come here for the Sacred Temple Beads?<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still refusing to admit it? Fine. We already know what you&rsquo;re up to. Your plan won&rsquo;t succeed,&rdquo; the Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief replied as he continued to tug on the stone.<br>&ldquo;A bunch of fools who blindly trust whatever the stone monument tells you. Are you going to kill yourself if it tells you to do so?&rdquo; an old voice echoed.<br>The crowd turned their sights over, only to be shocked by what they saw. The person who had spoken was none other than the elder Chu Feng had met in the Yuan Lineage Tribe.<br>&ldquo;Yuan Jiang! Y-you&hellip; aren&rsquo;t dead?!&rdquo; the Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief exclaimed with a look of unease.<br>They knew very well what Yuan Jiang was capable of. In terms of strength, he was on par with the Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief. It cost them the lives of many of their peers before they managed to defeat Yuan Jiang and take down the Yuan Lineage Tribe.<br>Yet, who could have thought that Yuan Jiang was still alive?<br>On top of that, Yuan Jiang was an extremely meticulous person who would only move if he was certain of victory. In other words, he had come prepared.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? You look flustered,&rdquo; Yuan Jiang asked with a smile.<br>A vicious glint momentarily flashed across his eyes before he abruptly vanished. By the time he reappeared again, he was already standing in front of the Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief.<br>The Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief tried to attack Yuan Jiang, but&hellip;<br>Uwa!<br>Before he could make a move, Yuan Jiang had already released his oppressive might.<br>The white-haired woman, Bai Yunqing, Chu Feng, Jia Chengying, and Qin Shu remained safe and sound, but the Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief and elders all toppled onto the ground. Their tendons snapped and their bones shattered as fresh blood spurted everywhere.<br>Those from the Ancient Realm sustained severe injuries from Yuan Jiang&rsquo;s oppressive might, including the Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief. Their faces turned ashened in despair.<br>They realized that Yuan Jiang&rsquo;s cultivation had actually surpassed the Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief.<br>We&rsquo;re doomed. All of us are doomed.<br>Shoosh!<br>Yuan Jiang suddenly swung his sleeves, releasing a wind blade that sent the arm of the Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief flying across the air. His hand shot up and grabbed the severed arm.<br>&ldquo;Yuan Jiang, are you going to torture me? Show me your worst! I&rsquo;m not afraid of you!!!&rdquo; the Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief roared.<br>Yet, to everyone&rsquo;s bewilderment, Yuan Jiang ignored him. He pulled out the stone grasped by the severed arm before tossing the arm away. It turned out that his goal wasn&rsquo;t the arm of the Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief but the stone grasped by it!<br>Upon acquiring the stone, Yuan Jiang turned his attention toward Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brat, you&rsquo;ve worked hard,&rdquo; Yuan Jiang said with a sinister smile.<br>He placed the stone on Chu Feng&rsquo;s forehead and did the exact same thing as the Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief.<br>Chu Feng was stunned. He had thought that Yuan Jiang had come here to save him, but that clearly wasn&rsquo;t the case at all!<br>The others were shocked too. Even Jia Chengying and Qin Shu, despite their animosity toward Chu Feng, were baffled. They also thought that Yuan Jiang was here to save Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Ki ki ki&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Sinister laughter echoed in the air. It was from Zhou Dong.<br>He was lying inside a sedan as he was still severely injured, but the ones carrying his sedan were actually the people of the Yuan Lineage Tribe. It turned out that they had been feigning madness all this while!<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, do you finally understand what I mean when I said that I am the Chosen One? You have already lost from the very start!&rdquo; Zhou Dong said gleefully.<br></div>
