        <h1>Chapter 5093</h1>
        <div>: Legendary Figure<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo;<br>Sima Xiangtu felt a jolt in his soul as goosebumps rose all over his body. There were many things he would like to say, but he found himself incapable of speaking coherently.<br>How could it be the Ox-nosed Old Daoist of all people?!<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist was looking at him with a smile, showing no fear despite being faced with a godlike enemy. It was almost as if everything was under his control.<br>The two of them used to be close brothers many years ago. The world thought that the two of them were equals, but actually, Sima Xiangtu had grown under the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s protection back when they were in the Holy Light Galaxy. Every time Sima Xiangtu encountered danger, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist would step forward and save him.<br>It was with the same composed and confident expression he was showing right now that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist would resolve all crises with ease.<br>But&hellip; those were just small fries from the Holy Light Galaxy. Those enemies weren&rsquo;t worth a mention at all when he looked back on them now. There was no way they could compare to the overwhelmingly powerful god before him.<br>So how could the Ox-nosed Old Daoist still appear so composed and confident?<br>That very instant, Sima Xiangtu realized the truth. It was just that the truth was so terrifying that it immediately shattered the self-confidence he had painstakingly built up.<br>It turned out that he had never surpassed the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&hellip;<br>It turned out that the distance between them had only been growing larger over time&hellip;<br>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you kill me?&rdquo; Sima Xiangtu asked uncomprehendingly.<br>&ldquo;Xiangtu, let&rsquo;s talk about our affairs later on. I&rsquo;ll deal with this man first.&rdquo;<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist flicked his hand, and Sima Xiangtu&rsquo;s Celestial Master's Army Seal immediately appeared in his grasp. He began examining it closely.<br>&ldquo;The Celestial Master's Army Seal is one of the Ten Sect Treasures of the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Sacred Sect. It was said to be personally constructed by the sect founder by absorbing the spiritual essence of countless beings using the Immemorial Soul Ring and manifesting it into a soul rallying spirit formation. Its spirit formation can be used to create spirit soldiers.<br>&ldquo;Rumor has it that the sect founder passed the treasure to his 17th personal disciple, Shentu Haoting, before passing away.<br>&ldquo;Back then, the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Sacred Sect was vying with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion for supremacy in the Seven Realms Galaxy. Shentu Haoting lost his life in the conflict, and the Celestial Master's Army Seal disappeared along with him. From the looks of it now, it would appear that Shentu Haoting didn&rsquo;t die and instead brought the Celestial Master's Army Seal with him to the Nine Souls Galaxy.&rdquo;<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist turned to look at the middle-aged man.<br>&ldquo;I never thought that someone would remember this old man even after so many years. I&rsquo;m also surprised by the strength wielded by the juniors in the present era. Are you from the Nine Souls Galaxy?&rdquo; the middle-aged man asked.<br>He wasn&rsquo;t angered by the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s aggression. On the contrary, it looked like he was filled with admiration for the latter.<br>Of course, his words were an implicit acknowledgment that he was indeed Shentu Haoting.<br>&ldquo;It matters not to you where I&rsquo;m from. Speak. Why are you suddenly appearing here now after so many years of concealment? Are you just waiting for a person to aid you in mastering your divine skill? Even so, there&rsquo;s no way you would have waited for such a long time for no reason. It can&rsquo;t be that you&rsquo;re heeding some kind of dog crap prophecy, are you?&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist asked mockingly with smiling crescent eyes.<br>It was almost as if he was saying that Shentu Haoting was a fool for waiting so many years just because of a single prophecy.<br>&ldquo;Are you determined to protect him?&rdquo; Shentu Haoting asked.<br>Those words revealed his intention.<br>&ldquo;Only I can take his life,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist replied.<br>&ldquo;I am someone who cherishes talents, so I&rsquo;ll give you a choice. As long as you return the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Army Seal to me, I&rsquo;ll spare that man,&rdquo; Shentu Haoting said.<br>&ldquo;Oh? The Celestial Master&rsquo;s Army Seal is a wonderful treasure. How could I return it to you?&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said as he slipped the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Army Seal into his robe.<br>Sima Xiangtu&rsquo;s face turned ghastly pale at that sight. The Ox-nosed Old Daoist was simply too arrogant!<br>He had heard of Shentu Haoting before; the latter was one of the strongest individuals in the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Sacred Sect back then. To put it in the other words, the middle-aged man was practically someone who had walked out from the legends!<br>It was a miracle that Shentu Haoting was still alive after so many years, but this also meant that he must have made substantial advancements in his cultivation during this period of time. That made Shentu Haoting a real &lsquo;ancient monster&rsquo; in the present era.<br>Yet, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was coveting the treasure of such a person? That was no different from courting death!<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Sima Xiangtu was stunned by what came afterward. Despite the Ox-nosed Old Daoist going overboard with his greed, Shentu Haoting actually shook his head and smiled.<br>&ldquo;Juniors nowadays sure are scary. Since that&rsquo;s the case, I&rsquo;ll give the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Army Seal to you.&rdquo;<br>Shentu Haoting was actually prepared to give the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Army Seal to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist! After saying those words, he turned around and got ready to leave.<br>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;<br>But barely after Shentu Haoting turned around, a figure suddenly appeared in front of him. It was a clone of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; Shentu Haoting asked.<br>&ldquo;You said that you wanted Sima Xiangtu to help you master your divine skill, but your disappointment shows that the person whom you are looking for isn&rsquo;t him. If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, the junior whom you have been waiting for is Chu Feng, right?&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist asked.<br>&ldquo;You know Chu Feng too?&rdquo; Shentu Haoting asked with a frown.<br>He was getting an ominous feeling.<br>&ldquo;It sure is a coincidence, but Chu Feng is my beloved disciple,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.<br>&ldquo;Shit! Why are there such coincidences in the world?&rdquo; Shentu Haoting couldn&rsquo;t help but curse under his breath, but he was able to quickly adjust his mood.<br>&ldquo;Alright. Since Chu Feng is your disciple, I shan&rsquo;t bother him. Let&rsquo;s call it quits here,&rdquo; Shentu Haoting said.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that you&rsquo;re listening to me. Since Chu Feng is my beloved disciple, it&rsquo;d be dangerous if an old monster like you had your eyes set on him. It&rsquo;s my job as his master to eliminate such dangers lurking around him ahead of time,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.<br>Shentu Haoting&rsquo;s face turned icy-cold. He looked at the Ox-nosed Old Daoist with a sudden burst of hostility. He emanated such an intimidating aura that hardly anyone would dare to look at him in the face, but the Ox-nosed Old Daoist remained unfazed.<br>&ldquo;What do you want to do then?&rdquo; Shentu Haoting asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll take a dead man to assure me,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist replied.<br>Boom!<br>A ferocious storm filled with murderous intent swept across the surroundings. It was released by Shentu Haoting.<br>Sima Xiangtu trembled in fear at the sight. He had never seen such terrifying murderous intent before. Once again, he was enlightened as to how powerful the top powerhouses of the world of cultivation were.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re more arrogant than you look. I gave you multiple chances, but you trampled all over my goodwill. Did you think that you would really be able to stop me?&rdquo; Shentu Haoting asked coldly.<br>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re trying to intimidate me, I&rsquo;m afraid that I won't buy into that. Do the cultivators of your generation really talk so much? I should probably let you know that empty words won&rsquo;t scare anyone in the present era. Shentu Haoting, if you want to live, you&rsquo;ll have to prove yourself worthy.&rdquo;<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s eyes suddenly turned grim.<br>Boom!<br>A deafening explosion sounded, and shockwaves devoured the surroundings.<br>At this very moment, Sima Xiangtu could only wrap his arms around his head and squat helplessly on the spot. He couldn&rsquo;t see anything at all, and all he could feel were devastating shockwaves rampaging around him. Even the slightest shockwave nicking him could easily disintegrate him.<br>Yet, he remained safe and sound because there was a barrier protecting him. It came from the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br></p></div>
