        <h1>Chapter 5329</h1>
        <div>: Difference in Lightning Wings<br>Zhou Dong warily assessed Chu Feng as his body trembled in fear. As he repeatedly confirmed that Chu Feng was only at rank one Half-God level, he felt a little dazed.<br>&ldquo;What was with that earlier pressure?&rdquo;<br>He was certain that the frightening pressure had come from Chu Feng, but how could a mere rank one Half-God level cultivator possibly induce fear in him?<br>Even Bai Yunqing and the white-haired woman were looking at Chu Feng with perplexed eyes too. After all, they had felt the same pressure as Zhou Dong earlier.<br>Shoosh.<br>The boy suddenly shot into Chu Feng&rsquo;s forehead as a ray of light, plunging the latter&rsquo;s consciousness into a dark, boundless world.<br>Chu Feng felt like he was floating in the midst of vast space, just that there was not a single star to be seen around him. It was all dark.<br>All of a sudden, a brilliant light shone as an incomparably gargantuan figure was rising from the distance.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Eggy clenched her fists nervously.<br>The figure was stupendously massive to the point where it would have been bigger than countless realms combined together. It should have been an extremely far distance away, but Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t make out its full form. Before it, he was no more than a speck of dust.<br>Chu Feng could sense the Ancient Realm&rsquo;s aura from it. It could have very well been the strongest being that he had encountered thus far, and it heaped a huge amount of stress on him.<br>The figure raised its gargantuan hands and pointed at Chu Feng. It shot out a beam of light, which stopped in its track right before it reached him.<br>It was the boy, who was also the key to the gate. The innocence that was previously in his eyes had been replaced by viciousness. Even though his appearance still looked the same, his gaze felt inexplicably chilling.<br>&ldquo;This exalted is the ancestor of the Ancient Realm, as well as its creator. Absorb this wisp of energy from me, and you&rsquo;ll be able to safely leave this place.&rdquo;<br>It was a voice that sounded as if it had come from the edge of the world. It was powerful yet ancient, and it commanded a natural authority. It was so overwhelming that it felt like it had come from a true god.<br>Even so, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t blindly heed the other party&rsquo;s instructions. Instead, he asked, &ldquo;Elder, are there any benefits for me if I absorb your energy?&rdquo;<br>He couldn&rsquo;t sense anything from the boy&rsquo;s body that could be beneficial to him. On the contrary, it would only bring him danger.<br>&ldquo;Benefits? Will you not absorb it if there are no benefits?&rdquo; the figure asked.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to absorb it if there are no benefits,&rdquo; Chu Feng honestly answered.<br>&ldquo;Hahahaha&hellip;&rdquo; The figure suddenly burst into laughter. It shook not just the earth or the sky but the entire boundless universe Chu Feng was in. After the laughter finally settled down, the figure continued with a wintry voice, &ldquo;You may refuse to absorb my energy, but everyone you care about will die, be it your friends outside or your world spirit.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What the hell is wrong with the Ancient Realm? They were the ones who invited you here, but they are threatening you instead of rewarding you for clearing their test? Chu Feng, you mustn&rsquo;t absorb the energy. Let&rsquo;s see what it&rsquo;ll do about it. At the very most, we&rsquo;ll just go down together!&rdquo; Eggy roared.<br>It was not as if she couldn&rsquo;t sense the terrifying pressure exerted by the figure. She was terrified too, but she couldn&rsquo;t hold back her anger when she saw the figure threatening Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing. All I have to do is to fuse with that little boy. Look at how cute that little boy is. It should be beneficial to me.&rdquo; Chu Feng quickly placated Eggy.<br>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;<br>Eggy had also taken a look at the boy, and she could tell as much that absorbing the boy would bring about nothing but danger. If she had to describe it, the boy felt like a seed of malice that would bring about unthinkable consequences if absorbed into the body.<br>Chu Feng also finally understood why his father backed out of this trial. His father must have noticed the danger lurking in the Ancient Realm.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, that thing is too dangerous. You mustn&rsquo;t absorb it. There might be other ways out,&rdquo; Eggy advised.<br>&ldquo;Afraid? I thought that you wouldn&rsquo;t fear anything since you cleared my test of courage,&rdquo; the figure sneered. &ldquo;Make your decision right now. Absorb it or die.&rdquo;<br>A furious storm began stirring in the void, baring its killing intent at Chu Feng. The figure wasn&rsquo;t joking at all. It truly wielded the power to obliterate everything.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll absorb it,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>He was no pushover, but he had no plans of dying a fool&rsquo;s death. He had to remain alive because there were still many things he needed to do. At the very least, he couldn&rsquo;t lose his life here.<br>He knew that the boy was dangerous, but that was a problem he could resolve later on as long as he remained alive. His priority right now was ensuring his, Eggy, the white-haired woman, and Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s safety. Thus, he decided to absorb the boy.<br>The boy had a malevolent smile that made others feel incredibly uncomfortable. He walked up to Chu Feng and entered his body.<br>Gah!<br>It was so excruciating that it challenged the limits of Chu Feng&rsquo;s willpower. He felt like his entire body was being ripped off again and again. He was practically screaming his lungs out in this world, but outside, his body was standing still, not moving in the least.<br>Due to that, neither Bai Yunqing nor the white-haired woman was aware of what he was going through. They weren&rsquo;t in the least worried about him since the boy&rsquo;s light barrier was protecting him.<br>Rather, they were still struggling to come to terms with the terrifying pressure they had felt from Chu Feng earlier.<br>&ldquo;Miss Bai, did you feel it just now? I&rsquo;m referring to the terrifying aura that came from my big brother&rsquo;s body,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing asked via voice transmission.<br>It had only lasted for an instant, but it gave him the shudders just to think about it.<br>&ldquo;Mmhm,&rdquo; the white-haired woman replied with a nod.<br>&ldquo;Miss Bai, you&rsquo;re much more knowledgeable than me. Do you know what&rsquo;s going on? Could it be that my big brother didn&rsquo;t manage to fully absorb the Heavenly Lightning Affliction, which later created an illusion that the pressure was coming from my big brother when it was in fact from the heavenly lightning?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing asked.<br>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t from the Heavenly Lightning Affliction. It came from another source, and it was definitely from Chu Feng,&rdquo; the white-haired woman replied with certainty<br>While they were conversing, an imprint started forming on Chu Feng&rsquo;s forehead. It was the same imprint on the boy statue. After a long silence, Chu Feng suddenly moved. His hands shot to his knees to support himself as he gasped for air.<br>It looked like he had been through a tribulation that he had to pay a heavy price to overcome.<br>As a matter of fact, he did pay a heavy price to absorb the boy. He felt as if his soul had been torn apart and reconstructed again and again. No one else other than him would have been able to endure that pain. Those who were luckier might just pass out, whereas those who were less lucky might suffer from lunacy or even death.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing rushed forward to support Chu Feng.<br>Shoosh!<br>The white-haired woman suddenly charged at Zhou Dong.<br>Boom!<br>A loud explosion ensued.<br>The white-haired woman had started crossing blows with Zhou Dong.<br>It turned out that the light barrier had vanished the moment Chu Feng regained his freedom. Without any hesitation, Zhou Dong exploited the opportunity to launch his attack, but the white-haired woman, who had been keeping a close eye on him, reacted right away.<br>The white-haired woman used her forbidden mysterious skill to raise her cultivation from rank four to rank six Half-God level.<br>Zhou Dong was also a rank four Half-God level cultivator. It turned out that he possessed the Heavenly Bloodline too as he summoned his Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor, raising his cultivation to rank six Half-God level.<br>As powerful as the white-haired woman was, Zhou Dong was no weakling either. The two of them appeared to be equally matched.<br>&ldquo;Scram, I&rsquo;m just taking back the power that belongs to me! Don&rsquo;t force my hand!&rdquo; Zhou Dong roared at the white-haired woman.<br>The white-haired woman didn&rsquo;t say a word, but her attacks were all directed toward Zhou Dong&rsquo;s vitals. She had already made up her mind to kill the latter. Through her overwhelming killing intent, she quickly managed to claim the upper hand.<br>&ldquo;Miss Bai is amazing,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing complimented by the sideline.<br>Tzlala!<br>Lightning suddenly crackled from Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s side. His eyes widened in shock as he hurriedly turned his head over.<br>It was Chu Feng.<br>Upon seeing the battle between Zhou Dong and the white-haired woman, he immediately summoned his Lightning Mark, Lightning Armor, and Lightning Wing. His cultivation rose from rank one Half-God level all the way to rank four Half-God level.<br>&ldquo;The hell! Big brother Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re able to summon Lightning Wings at Half-God level?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing stared at Chu Feng in disbelief.<br>He also possessed the Heavenly Bloodline as well, which was why he knew how difficult it was to summon Lightning Wings at Half-God level. In fact, it had been a long time since he had seen Lightning Wings at all.<br>But Chu Feng pulled it off. His monstrous talent extended to his cultivation too.<br>However, Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t in the mood to respond to Bai Yunqing. His eyes were fixated on the battle between the white-haired woman and Zhou Dong.<br>&ldquo;Something is wrong.&rdquo;<br>An ominous feeling welled up in Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart. He could tell that Zhou Dong was feigning weakness, which suggested that the latter was preparing something huge.<br>&ldquo;Miss Bai, be careful. Zhou Dong is up to something,&rdquo; Chu Feng sent a voice transmission to warn the white-haired woman.<br>Right after those words were spoken, lightning crackled behind Zhou Dong. Two massive wings shot out from his back. It was Lightning Wings!<br>Zhou Dong was actually able to activate Lightning Wings at Half-God level too!<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s able to activate Lightning Wings too? This is madness!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing was stunned.<br>There were three possessors of Heavenly Bloodline here, but two of them were able to activate Lightning Wings whereas he was the only one who couldn&rsquo;t. This put him in an awkward position.<br>&ldquo;Wait a minute, there&rsquo;s something wrong about his Lightning Wing. He&rsquo;s relying on the power of treasures and pills to activate his Lightning Wing,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing murmured.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s Lightning Wings were both majestic and imposing.<br>On the other hand, Zhou Dong&rsquo;s Lightning Wings were smaller and much less impressive. Most important of all, it had only raised his fighting prowess instead of increasing his cultivation rank, which meant that he was still at rank six Half-God level.<br>The contrast between the two made Zhou Dong&rsquo;s Lightning Wings look unbearably fake.<br>Most likely, Zhou Dong had summoned his Lightning Wings with the help of external energy instead of his own strength, thus resulting in the current situation.<br>&ldquo;How shameless can you get, Zhou Dong? Why are you trying to flaunt when all you&rsquo;re doing is relying on external help?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing mocked. He gestured toward Chu Feng and added, &ldquo;Look, this is what the real Lightning Wings look like!&rdquo;<br>Zhou Dong had been too focused on the fight that he hadn&rsquo;t noticed what was going on at Chu Feng&rsquo;s side. It was only upon hearing Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s words that he turned his gaze over and saw that Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation had risen to rank four Half-God level.<br>Most important of all, Chu Feng had invoked the Lightning Mark, Lightning Armor, and Lightning Wings. His brilliant Lightning Wings were very different from his own, and it made his one look pathetic in comparison.<br>Zhou Dong&rsquo;s complexion turned awful.<br>It was one thing for him to lose to Chu Feng in terms of world spiritist techniques and means, but to think that his bloodline would be inferior as well.<br>&ldquo;All of you must die!&rdquo;<br>Zhou Dong&rsquo;s eyes glowed with murderous intent. With a swing of his sword, he released numerous surges of sword qi at Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing.<br>Fortunately, the white-haired woman stepped in and blocked off Zhou Dong&rsquo;s attack.<br>&ldquo;Nosey.&rdquo;<br>Zhou Dong glared at the white-haired woman before launching another wave of offense against her. Even though his Lightning Wings didn&rsquo;t raise his cultivation rank, it made him much stronger than before.<br>Sure enough, the white-haired woman began struggling to keep up.<br>Bloodied lacerations were inflicted on her body one after another, and her circumstances only continued to worsen. At this rate, she would really lose her life.<br>Seeing that, Chu Feng took out his Immemorial Hero&rsquo;s Sword and gripped it tightly. His eyes hardened in determination.<br>Hesitation flickered in the eyes of the white-haired woman. She felt indignant at being pushed back by Zhou Dong, but she seemed to be fearful of something.<br>All of a sudden, her eyes widened as an ominous feeling struck her. She felt a lethal threat from Zhou Dong&rsquo;s attack. To make things worse, she was unable to dodge the attack. She could only watch helplessly as death approached her.<br>Boom!<br>A powerful lightning bolt suddenly zappedZhou Dong&rsquo;s body.<br>Gah!<br>Zhou Dong cried in agony as he hurriedly made his retreat. That single attack had almost rendered him powerless.<br>The white-haired woman immediately turned to Chu Feng, sensing that the attack had come from him.<br></div>
