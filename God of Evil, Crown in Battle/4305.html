        <div> - Who Is It?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Wuu---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Xianhai Shaoyu felt his head getting heavy. Then, he felt extremely sleepy.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? Could this be a side effect caused by fourth uncle stipping the power from my body?&rdquo;<br>Xianhai Shaoyu doesn&rsquo;t want to lose consciousness at a time like this.<br>He wanted to continue to watch the battle. He wanted to see exactly how powerful Chu Feng after undergoing bloodline berserk would become.<br>Xianhai Shaoyu tried his hardest to withstand the desire to sleep. He even took out medicines and took them.<br>While he was confined and unable to move freely, he was still capable of taking out items from his Cosmos Sack.<br>For the sake of overcoming his sleepiness, Xianhai Shaoyu took three successive medicinal pellets. All three of those medicinal pellets were of extraordinary value.<br>Once they entered his mouth, they turned into gaseous flames that engulfed his entire body.<br>But, Xianhai Shaoyu was unable to feel any sense of joy even after taking them.<br>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re useless?&rdquo;<br>Xianhai Shaoyu started to panic. Even though he took three priceless medicinal pellets in succession, they were unable to curb his sleepiness.<br>He had no idea what to do if this was to continue.<br>Soon, Xianhai Shaoyu was unable to endure his sleepiness anymore and fell unconscious.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on with this Xianhai Shaoyu?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hey! You pretending to be dead?!&rdquo;<br>Seeing that Xianhai Shaoyu suddenly fell onto the ground, the Demon Morph Clansmen were all surprised. They went up to him to examine him.<br>After all, the power within Xianhai Shaoyu was still of use to them. If he dies like this, they would not be able to retrieve the power from him.<br>After they discovered that Xianhai Shaoyu was still breathing and had only lost consciousness, they decided to not pay any more attention to him.<br>After all, it was Xianhai Renhu who restricted Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>No matter what sort of trick Xianhai Shaoyu might try, he would not be able to break free.<br>As such, the people from the Demon Morph Clan turned their gazes back to Chu Feng and their two leaders&rsquo; battle.<br>The current situation of the battle was very unfavorable to them.<br>Xianhai Renhu and the red-haired leader were unable to cause any harm to Chu Feng even after joining hands.<br>Instead, it was the two of them that were being suppressed by Chu Feng.<br>While they&rsquo;ve not sustained any serious injuries, the two of them were already panting. If this was to continue, it would only be a matter of time before they&rsquo;re defeated.<br>&ldquo;One&rsquo;s bloodline going berserk is this powerful?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would appear that we will have to prepare to withdraw from this place.&rdquo;<br>Xianhai Renhu said to the red-haired leader using voice transmission.<br>The red-haired leader nodded his head at Xianhai Renhu&rsquo;s proposal.<br>The two of them had displayed their full strength against Chu Feng. But, Chu Feng still didn&rsquo;t go all out against them.<br>The reason why they did not flee directly was because they were waiting.<br>They knew Chu Feng&rsquo;s bloodline would not forever remain in a berserk state. Sooner or later, the berserk state will wear off.<br>They were waiting for the time when Chu Feng&rsquo;s bloodline&rsquo;s berserk state wears off.<br>But, they must still prepare for an alternative just in case.<br>It was possible for Chu Feng&rsquo;s bloodline&rsquo;s berserk state to become even stronger.<br>At that time, they would no longer be able to take him on.<br>As such, if they find the situation to have turned bad, they must leave at once.<br>If they failed to escape promptly, they might not be able to escape at all.<br>&ldquo;Zzzzz---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, something strange happened.<br>The lightnings Chu Feng unleashed at them was actually blocked.<br>&ldquo;Wuu---&rdquo;<br>Then, a look of pain appeared on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face.<br>It was a look of struggle.<br>&ldquo;Eeeahhh---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng started screaming.<br>Boundless lightnings were being unleashed from his body nonstop.<br>Even the space within the starry sky was being shattered.<br>Sensing the power unleashed by Chu Feng, Xianhai Renhu and the red-haired leader immediately moved away. They were able to sense that the power unleashed by Chu Feng right now was capable of killing them.<br>But, strangely, even though the power unleashed by Chu Feng was so very terrifying, they would be quickly sealed away by a mysterious power soon after their release.<br>Chu Feng seemed to be trapped within a certain range.<br>No matter how devastating his powers were, they were unable to exceed that range.<br>Furthermore, the range was constantly decreasing.<br>Finally, the lightnings in the sky began to disperse.<br>The lightnings unleashed by Chu Feng also completely disappeared.<br>His eyes that were surging with lightnings also closed shut.<br>After this region of the starry sky returned to its prior peaceful state, Chu Feng had fallen asleep again.<br>&ldquo;It disappeared?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;His bloodline finally finished going berserk.&rdquo;<br>Xianhai Renhu heaved a sigh of relief upon seeing this sight.<br>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s amiss,&rdquo; But, the red-haired leader was skeptical.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s amiss?&rdquo; asked Xianhai Renhu.<br>&ldquo;According to my clan&rsquo;s records, while bloodline going berserk will eventually fade away, the manner at which his berserk bloodline returned to normal was different from what was recorded by my clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This does not resemble a natural disappearance. Instead, it seemed like it was forcibly suppressed by some sort of power,&rdquo; said the red-haired leader.<br>&ldquo;None of that matters. As long as that kid calmed down, it will be advantageous for us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, never would I imagine for a genius of this caliber to appear in a place like the Holy Light Galaxy,&rdquo; Xianhai Renhu looked to Chu Feng. Shock filled his eyes.<br>&ldquo;That is indeed a pleasant surprise.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Encountering this kid is truly a sign of the heavens looking out for us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if we failed to find that power in the Holy Light Galaxy, we would not have come here in vain.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Once Lord Clan Chief learned of this kid, he will definitely reward the two of us.&rdquo;<br>Different from Xianhai Renhu&rsquo;s exclamation of surprise, the red-haired leader who managed to awaken from the shock Chu Feng gave him started to laugh strangely.<br>&ldquo;You seemed to have some other plan in mind?&rdquo; asked Xianhai Renhu.<br>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What that kid possesses is the same Heavenly Bloodline that my clan possesses.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;To be able to allow his bloodline to enter a berserk state, his bloodline has reached an inestimable level of power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is simply a waste for such a powerful bloodline to end in the hands of a trash like him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It should instead be in the control of our Demon Morph Clan.&rdquo;<br>As the red-haired leader spoke, he began to walk toward Chu Feng.<br>Xianhai Renhu knew what he was planning to do.<br>He was no longer simply planning to strip away the power Chu Feng gained from the black case.<br>That red-haired leader was also planning to strip away Chu Feng&rsquo;s bloodline&rsquo;s power.<br>This sort of thing was not only very difficult to do, it was also extremely cruel.<br>It was something so cruel that it would arouse everyone&rsquo;s anger.<br>But, for the sake of obtaining a stronger bloodline, the Demon Morph Clan was willing to do anything.<br>They simply don&rsquo;t care about Chu Feng&rsquo;s life and death.<br>&ldquo;Who are you calling trash?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a voice sounded from the distant starry sky.<br>&ldquo;Who is it?!&rdquo;<br>The Demon Morph Clansmen&rsquo;s expression all grew tense the moment they heard that voice.<br>Even the red-haired leader and Xianhai Renhu were no exception.<br>At this moment, they all turned their gazes toward Chu Feng&rsquo;s direction.<br>The reason for that was because that voice sounded from Chu Feng&rsquo;s direction.<br>But, they were certain that was not Chu Feng&rsquo;s voice.<br>There was someone else here!<br></p></div>
