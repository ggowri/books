        <h1>Chapter 4963</h1>
        <div>: Yin Ren&rsquo;s True Face<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;You knew about Yin Ren&rsquo;s plan right from the start? You were never sincere about helping me. You were colluding with Yin Ren to corner me?&rdquo; Chu Feng questioned.<br>Even though his mind was fixated on saving Xian Miaomiao all this while, he had no intention of leaving Princess Xiaoxiao in the lurch. He saw Princess Xiaoxiao as his friend too, and he would do his best to think of a way to save her as well.<br>Due to that, he was extremely disappointed by this betrayal.<br>&ldquo;I have no intention of harming you, but&hellip; I don&rsquo;t want to die either,&rdquo; Princess Xiaoxiao replied.<br>&ldquo;Princess Xiaoxiao, don&rsquo;t you get it? All Chu Feng is interested in is saving Xian Miaomiao. He doesn&rsquo;t care about your survival at all! If he really cares about you, he would have at least given some thought as to how he could ensure your safety before seeking to extract Xian Miaomiao from your body. All he&rsquo;s saying are empty promises.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to bother explaining yourself to a person like him. Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll deal with him myself!&rdquo;<br>Master Yin Ren released his spirit power as a rank eight Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritist and sealed off Chu Feng&rsquo;s surroundings.<br>A frown formed on Chu Feng&rsquo;s forehead. He could clearly sense Master Yin Ren&rsquo;s tremendous strength. It was far greater than what he had faced back when they were in Princess Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s soul.<br>It was to the extent where Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t confident in dealing with him.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, Daoist Niantian and the others are currently focused on channeling the formation outside, and it just so happens that my formation has isolation properties. You can shout all you want, but they won&rsquo;t be able to hear you. I suggest you surrender so as to spare yourself from pain,&rdquo; Master Yin Ren said.<br>Chu Feng looked at Princess Xiaoxiao and spoke sharply, &ldquo;Is that what you think? You want me to surrender so that I can become trapped in your soul, just like Miaomiao? It looks like you aren&rsquo;t contented with just taking Miaomiao&rsquo;s soul. You wish to turn me into your nutrients too.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Master Yin Ren, is what Chu Feng said true? You want to bind Chu Feng&rsquo;s soul to mine? You promised me that you wouldn&rsquo;t hurt Chu Feng no matter what happens!&rdquo; Princess Xiaoxiao turned to Master Yin Ren and exclaimed.<br>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s hurting who?&rdquo;<br>A voice suddenly boomed.<br>The formation constructed around them forcefully ripped apart, and three people entered the area. They were Daoist Niantian, Shengguang Buyu, and Shengguang Baimei.<br>They walked over without any hesitation and took their position beside Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Yin Ren, you must have taken us for fools. Did you think that we would obediently channel the formation just because you told us to? I&rsquo;ll have you know that we haven&rsquo;t forgotten what our priority here is.<br>&ldquo;Daoist Niantian has already noticed the isolation property you have embedded within the formation. We were only biding our time for you to tear off your mask and reveal your true intention!&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei said.<br>&ldquo;Master Yin Ren!&rdquo;<br>Princess Xiaoxiao was flustered. She instinctively took a step back and hid behind Master Yin Ren.<br>Master Yin Ren had told her that he possessed the means to escape, but that was when Shengguang Baimei and the others were cultivating. Now that their eyes were on her, she didn&rsquo;t know whether the escape means that Master Yin Ren spoke of was still effective or not.<br>&ldquo;Princess Xiaoxiao, you need not panic. I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;<br>In contrast, Master Yin Ren was much calmer. Extraordinarily so.<br>&ldquo;It turned out that you have been guarding against me right from the start. How cold. Since that&rsquo;s the case, I shan&rsquo;t bother upholding civility with you either. I&rsquo;ve had enough tolerating your bullshit.&rdquo;<br>Master Yin Ren&rsquo;s narrowed eyes fell upon Shengguang Baimei. There was a chilling intent behind his gaze.<br>&ldquo;I can say the same too,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei replied with upshot eyebrows.<br>He released his aura.<br>It was only at rank eight Martial Exalted level initially, but as a unique aura flowed through his body, his cultivation rose further to rank nine Martial Exalted level. It was the bloodline power of the Holy Light Clan.<br>Without a moment&rsquo;s delay, he charged at Master Yin Ren and hurled a punch toward the latter&rsquo;s face. He had been wanting to do this for a long time now, and he thought that he would be letting Master Yin Ren off too lightly if he simply killed him. He wanted to take his time reducing Master Yin Ren to a pile of meat.<br>Boom!<br>That single punch shattered space.<br>Pah!<br>Yet, Master Yin Ren managed to block that terrifying punch with just a simple raise of his hand.<br>&ldquo;!!!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng and the others were appalled to see that.<br>It was also then that Master Yin Ren released his aura as a cultivator. To everyone&rsquo;s astonishment, his cultivation was at the same level as Shengguang Baimei, rank nine Martial Exalted level.<br>Even Princess Xiaoxiao was visibly shocked by that. She hadn&rsquo;t known that Master Yin Ren was that powerful.<br>It made her realize that he had been hiding his true strength from her all along.<br>What happened afterward left them even more flabbergasted.<br>With a simple squeeze of his hand, Master Yin Ren crushed Shengguang Baimei&rsquo;s fist into dust.<br>&ldquo;Shengguang Baimei, you&rsquo;re only able to reach rank nine Martial Exalted level using the enhancement of your clan&rsquo;s bloodline, but I&rsquo;m a true rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivator. How do you hope to stand against me?&rdquo; Master Yin Ren spoke scornfully.<br>The next moment, his aura grew even more intense. His fighting prowess had been raised by another rank. It didn&rsquo;t reach the level of a Half-God, but an ordinary rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivator couldn&rsquo;t hope to put up a fight against him.<br>&ldquo;This is bad. I underestimated him.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng knew right away that they had screwed up. They didn&rsquo;t stand a chance against the current Master Yin Ren at all.<br></p></div>
