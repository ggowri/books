        <h1>Chapter 4941</h1>
        <div>: Going to the Extreme<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, I&rsquo;m not going easy on him. Brother Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength has abruptly increased,&rdquo; Zhuge Feiluan replied.<br>The crowd noticed that the barrier was trembling. Taking a closer look, their eyes further widened in shock.<br>Zhuge Feiluan really hadn&rsquo;t gone easy on Chu Feng. He was still pushing the barrier outward with equal force, but Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength had abruptly increased to the point where he was finally able to stand against the barrier.<br>&ldquo;Go all out,&rdquo; the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief ordered.<br>Zhuge Feiluan clasped his fists tightly, changing his hand seal.<br>The transparent barrier immediately turned opaque black.<br>If the barrier resembled a glass wall earlier, it was now more like a metal fortress. On top of that, the pushing power of the barrier also increased threefold.<br>&ldquo;Incredible! It turned out that Zhuge Feiluan has indeed been holding back. I would have never thought that a junior would be capable of constructing a barrier of this caliber within such a short period of time,&rdquo; Shengguang Buyu murmured in admiration.<br>He had never seen such a talented junior before.<br>Boom!<br>There was a loud explosion as the enhanced barrier furthered its assault on Chu Feng. However, a jaw-dropping sight occurred.<br>Despite the increased might of the barrier, it was still unable to push back Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;<br>Putting aside the others, even the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and Zhuge Feiluan were confused.<br>They knew deep well that Zhuge Feiluan had truly gone all out, so how was Chu Feng still standing his ground?<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>A cold sneer formed on Chu Feng&rsquo;s lips.<br>Weng!<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s body suddenly emanated blinding light reminiscent of the sun. Even the crowd outside the spatial treasure was forced to cover their eyes. They had to use special means in order to continue watching the duel.<br>&ldquo;That is?!&rdquo;<br>The faces of those from the Zhuge Clan darkened upon taking a closer look.<br>Not only had Chu Feng&rsquo;s formation armor reached five hundred layers, but they were also interweaving together to form a complete whole. It increased the prowess of the formation armor by more than tenfold.<br>With the tables turned, Chu Feng began making his move. While continuing to hold back the barrier in place with his left hand, he drew his right hand back, clenched it into a fist, and let out a roar.<br>&ldquo;Break!&rdquo;<br>His right fist punched forth with astounding might.<br>Boom!<br>The moment the punch landed on the resilient barrier, cracks started forming like spider webs around the spot where Chu Feng&rsquo;s fist landed.<br>&ldquo;It was a feint!<br>&ldquo;From the start, young friend Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t merely stacking the formations up. He was constructing an incredibly powerful formation in parts. He was just confusing us by pretending to stack the formation armor up, which also greatly increased the difficulty of the feat!<br>&ldquo;It looks like young friend Chu Feng&rsquo;s skills are above that of Zhuge Feiluan&rsquo;s!&rdquo; Shengguang Buyu exclaimed.<br>His body was trembling ever so slightly, not out of fear, not out of fright, but out of excitement! He even shot to his feet.<br>He had never felt so excited before.<br>A prodigy of immeasurable talent had risen from their Holy Light Galaxy!<br>Shengguang Baimei and Daoist Niantian also took pride in Chu Feng&rsquo;s feat too.<br>Boom!<br>Chu Feng hurled yet another punch forward.<br>Crk!<br>The cracked barrier was unable to withstand the force of Chu Feng&rsquo;s attack anymore and shattered into pieces. Making use of this opening, Chu Feng immediately charged straight for Zhuge Feiluan.<br>Within moments, he was already standing right in front of Zhuge Feiluan, but he didn&rsquo;t sink his fist into the latter. Instead, he halted his fist right in front of the latter&rsquo;s face.<br>&ldquo;Brother Feiluan, we can end things here if you admit defeat,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>He could tell that Zhuge Feiluan was a kind person. The latter had been respectful to him from the start to the end. He was willing to go easy on someone like that.<br>Yet, despite having Chu Feng&rsquo;s fist right in front of him, there was not the slightest fear in Zhuge Feiluan&rsquo;s eyes. Instead, there was guilt.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re the better world spiritist of us. I admit that I&rsquo;m weaker than you. However, the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s honor is at stake in this fight. I have to win this battle. My deepest apologies.&rdquo;<br>Zhuge Feiluan took a step back, clasped his fist, and bowed deeply to Chu Feng.<br>The next moment, Zhuge Feiluan released an even larger surge of spirit power that devoured Chu Feng like a tsunami before tossing him out of the spatial treasure.<br>&ldquo;Zhuge Feiluan, you!!!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng stared at Zhuge Feiluan with conflicted feelings. The prowess Zhuge Feiluan had displayed earlier far surpassed what he could deal with.<br>He had lost in this battle.<br>However, he couldn&rsquo;t accept this outcome.<br>&ldquo;Zhuge Feiluan, you despicable scum!!!&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei roared.<br>Shengguang Buyu, Master Yin Ren, and Princess Xiaoxiao all had livid looks on their faces. Even the usually composed Daoist Niantian looked incredibly displeased.<br>Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t possibly have lost given the earlier circumstances because there was no time for Zhuge Feiluan to set up an even stronger formation anymore. The reason why Zhuge Feiluan was able to turn things around was because the spirit power he had released wasn&rsquo;t at rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation but rank six.<br>In other words, Zhuge Feiluan had deceived them all.<br>He wasn&rsquo;t at rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation but rank six.<br>&ldquo;Feiluan, you were able to make a breakthrough in the midst of the battle. You have truly surprised me!&rdquo; the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief exclaimed in delight.<br>However, Zhuge Feiluan didn&rsquo;t show the slightest delight on his face. Instead, after pushing Chu Feng out of the spatial treasure, he apologetically bowed once more to Chu Feng.<br>This made it clear that Zhuge Feiluan didn&rsquo;t make a breakthrough in the midst of the battle. He had intentionally concealed his strength. It was a scheme to make Chu Feng accept the duel.<br>From the very start, Chu Feng was doomed to lose this battle.<br>&ldquo;Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, do you have to go this far?&rdquo; Princess Xiaoxiao asked with chilling eyes.<br>The elders of the Zhuge Clan dared not to even meet her eyes. After all, she was the Nine Souls Sacred Clan&rsquo;s Princess Xiaoxiao.<br></p></div>
