        <h1>Chapter 4251</h1>
        <div> - The Sacred Ground Turning Into A Cemetery<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s finally here.&rdquo;<br>As they stared at the sacred light, practically everyone present had looks of anticipation on their faces.<br>The crowd&rsquo;s excitement had reached its peak.<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen and others that had Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain immediately took them out. They wanted to see if they could discover decisive opportunities from their incomplete maps.<br>At that moment, when some people were filled with joy, there were naturally some people that were worried.<br>At the same time as the majority of the crowd were absorbed in joy at the opening of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain, Lu Jie and his senior brothers and sisters were frowning.<br>&ldquo;Junior brother, why hasn&rsquo;t master shown himself yet?&rdquo;<br>The disciples of the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted were all looking at Lu Jie.<br>The reason they were worried was because their master, the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted, still hadn't revealed himself.<br>They were afraid that their master would miss out on the opportunity to enter the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain.<br>But, none of them knew the whereabouts of the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted. Lu Jie was the only one who knew their master&rsquo;s whereabouts.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know either. Logically speaking, master should&rsquo;ve arrived long ago.&rdquo;<br>Lu Jie wanted the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted to be there more than anyone else.<br>After all, he had received an unprecedented humiliation.<br>Only his master would be able to stand up for him.<br>&ldquo;Buzz---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the light emitted by the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain began changing.<br>The light gave off an enormous sense of oppression, and covered everyone present.<br>Feeling the oppression, those with strong cultivations all narrowed their brows. Expressions of difficulty appeared on their faces.<br>As for those with weak cultivations, they began bleeding from their seven facial orifices. Some even fell to the ground motionlessly. It was unknown if they had fainted or died.<br>This transformation made the crowd suddenly realize that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain was completely different from what they had imagined.<br>What the opening of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain brought them was not hope. Rather, it was death.<br>Seeing that the situation had turned bad, there were people that immediately set off to escape from the vicinity of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain.<br>But, right after flying off, those people fell from the sky.<br>The earth seemed to possess an enormous suction force. They were stuck on the ground and were unable to fly.<br>Seeing that they were unable to escape by flying, they decided to run away from the region.<br>But, they soon discovered that they were unable to run either.<br>All of them were restricted by the enormous suction force. Regardless of how strong their cultivations were, they were all trapped there.<br>Even Grandmaster Tang Chen, Grandmaster Luo Tuo, the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted and Celestial Fairy Muzhi were unable to move.<br>What brought the crowd the greatest despair was the fact that the enormous pressure was growing stronger by the second.<br>It was a threat of death. If they continued to linger there, all of them would be crushed alive by the power of the light.<br>&ldquo;How could this be?&rdquo;<br>The crowd started panicking. It was not only the people of the younger generation. Even the experts of the older generation panicked.<br>The oppression was so strong that it affected both their bodies and souls.<br>The oppression was real, completely real. It was threatening their lives.<br>In a panic, Yuan Shu turned to Grandmaster Tang Chen for help. &ldquo;Master, what&rsquo;s going on? Why is such a terrifying power restricting us?&rdquo;<br>As matters stood, he could only put his hope onto his master.<br>After all, his master was someone with a lot of experience and knowledge. He believed that his master should be able to handle the situation much better than him.<br>What Yuan Shu didn&rsquo;t know was that even his master, Grandmaster Tang Chen, was panicking.<br>Not even Grandmaster Tang Chen understood what was happening.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, take out your Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain too. See if they might have a way to shove this situation,&rdquo; Grandmaster Tang Chen said to Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng did not hesitate. He immediately took out all his Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain.<br>But, no matter how he assembled them, no matter how he examined them, he was unable to find any clues at all.<br>The oppression continued to grow stronger. At that moment, people with lower cultivations were all screaming in pain. Many had already lost consciousness.<br>&ldquo;Damn it! Exactly what is going on here?! Wasn&rsquo;t this an inheritance for world spiritists?! Why would it turn into a cemetery for world spiritists?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This place is simply not a place where one can obtain an inheritance! It&rsquo;s a place where we&rsquo;ll end up losing our lives!&rdquo; Someone shouted angrily. It was Grandmaster Luo Tuo.<br>Although renowned, Grandmaster Luo Tuo was actually unable to contain his emotions, and started making a huge fuss.<br>His furious shouts and snarls were thunderously loud. It sounded like a ferocious beast wreaking havoc throughout the surroundings.<br>But, it was all useless. No matter how powerful his abilities were, despite him being a Martial Exalted-level expert, he was still unable to escape.<br>Logically, someone of his caliber shouldn&rsquo;t lose their sense of rationality in such a situation.<br>But, after thinking about it, it was understandable too.<br>Grandmaster Luo Tuo was an extremely shrewd person.<br>He was amongst the first set of people to try to escape after realizing that the situation was amiss.<br>But, he discovered that he was trapped. Not only was he unable to escape, the threat of death was also pressing closer and closer upon him.<br>No, that was no threat. If they were unable to escape from, as time passed, everyone present would end up dying there. The only difference would be who would die first.<br>When even someone of Grandmaster Luo Tuo&rsquo;s caliber was crumbling from the threat of death, more and more people started crumbling.<br>Many renowned individuals began to howl in grief and cry bitterly.<br>Some were begging for forgiveness. Some were cursing loudly. Some even took forbidden medicines to strengthen themselves in hopes of being able to break free from the restrictions.<br>But, no matter what they did, it was all useless.<br>Seeing that he was unable to discover any clues from the incomplete maps, Chu Feng activated his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes to examine the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain.<br>He even took out the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk. He hoped to use it to find some clues.<br>Yet, all his efforts were in vain.<br>No matter what he did, he was unable to find any clues that would help him resolve their current situation.<br>The light coming from deep beneath the ground of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain was still enveloping the entire region.<br>All martial cultivators and world spiritists were trapped inside it.<br>That light was still as sacred as before. It resembled an illumination from the heavens.<br>Yet, the places illuminated by the light emitted an unbreachable killing intent.<br>Before that, no one would&rsquo;ve imagined that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain that they had looked forward to for so long would become their graveyard.<br>Small and weak. Being trapped there, apart from feeling how powerful the light was, everyone felt how small and weak they were.<br>Seeing the light, Chu Feng began to think. &ldquo;Could it be that this inheritance formation is so powerful that we&rsquo;re not even qualified to set foot into it?&rdquo;<br>Everyone present still stood outside the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain. No one dared to set foot into it.<br>But, even though they hadn't set foot into it, they were still able to sense the threat of death.<br>That feeling seemed to be telling them that they weren't even qualified to challenge the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain.<br>How mocking was this?!<br>Right at that moment, an aged voice sounded from the central region of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain, &ldquo;A bunch of scoundrels want to obtain this old man&rsquo;s inheritance?&rdquo;<br>Not only was the voice aged, it was also very powerful, and emitted an ancient aura.<br>Just hearing the voice, the crowd was able to tell that the person that the voice belonged to was extremely powerful.<br>&ldquo;Milord, we had no intention to offend you. Please spare us.&rdquo;<br>When the voice was heard, the crowd reacted as if they'd found a lifeline.<br>Many people began begging for forgiveness and kowtowing with their hands held in front of them.<br>They no longer wanted to obtain the inheritance. They only wanted to escape from that dangerous place.<br>But, the ancient voice did not respond to those people begging for forgiveness.<br>However, it also did not disappear.<br>Not long afterward, the ancient voice sounded again.<br>What was said this time had finally alleviated the panicked crowd&rsquo;s hearts.<br>They had seen a trace of hope.<br></p></div>
