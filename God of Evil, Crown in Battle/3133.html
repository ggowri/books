        <h1>Chapter 3132</h1>
        <div> - Target Me Alone<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were countless people that had Heavenly Lightning Bloodlines in the Ancestral Martial Starfield. Even those among them that trained in the Heaven Punishment Mysterious Technique numbered quite a few .<br>However, there was currently no one in the Ancestral Martial Starfield that trained in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.<br>However, one such person actually appeared before their eyes. With this, how could the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen not be astonished?<br>That said, what astonished them the most was the fact that Chu Feng had not only trained in the legendary Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique, but had also grasped such heaven-defying secret skills that were actually capable of granting him a level of heaven-defying battle power.<br>At that moment, everyone from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan realized that the Chu Heavenly Clansman that had suddenly appeared before them was no simple individual.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve just entered the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, right?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, even the expression of that rank eight Heavenly Immortal had changed. He no longer attempted to rashly attack Chu Feng, and instead began to question him.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; That rank eight Heavenly Immortal continued to ask.<br>&ldquo;I am proud of my name and stand by my actions. I am Chu Feng,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng?&rdquo; Hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s name, the expressions of the Cyanfeather Monstrous Beasts changed somewhat.<br>They were arranging the memories in their minds and carefully trying to remember any information regarding Chu Feng. Unfortunately, they were unable to recall anything about him.<br>They had never heard of the Chu Heavenly Clan having someone called Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;The Chu Heavenly Clan has truly concealed you well,&rdquo; Suddenly, an older individual from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan spoke with a cold laugh.<br>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Are you not someone that the Chu Heavenly Clan has secretly nurtured?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Otherwise, how could we have never heard of you before?&rdquo; That man asked.<br>&ldquo;Never heard of me before? I doubt that&rsquo;s the case,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled lightly.<br>&ldquo;We have truly never heard of you before,&rdquo; That rank eight Heavenly Immortal spoke with a mocking laugh.<br>Following that, the other Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen around that rank eight Heavenly Immortal also started laughing.<br>Their laughter was filled with mockery.<br>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Faced with their mockery-filled laughter, Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, he said, &ldquo;Have you all heard of Chu Xuanyuan?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Xuanyuan?&rdquo; Once Chu Feng brought up that name, the expressions of the Cyanfeather Monstrous Beasts immediately changed.<br>Very few people in the Ancestral Martial Starfield did not know about Chu Xuanyuan.<br>After all, he was someone who once shook the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield. Even now, tales of his accomplishments had been passed down with praise by many people.<br>When Chu Feng brought up the name &lsquo;Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;, they suddenly recalled the matter about Chu Feng.<br>Wasn&rsquo;t Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son called Chu Feng?<br>&ldquo;You are Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son?&rdquo; The Cyanfeather Monstrous Beasts asked with astonishment.<br>&ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; Chu Feng answered.<br>&ldquo;Impossible. Wasn&rsquo;t it said that you'd died long ago?&rdquo;<br>They were astonished upon hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s answer. After all, they&rsquo;d heard that Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son had died long ago. That was the reason why they did not associate Chu Feng with Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son right away.<br>&ldquo;I am evidently alive. Furthermore, I&rsquo;ve been living pretty well,&rdquo; Chu Feng spoke with a faint smile.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>After verifying Chu Feng&rsquo;s identity, all the people from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan were astonished.<br>After being astonished, they turned their gazes to that rank eight Heavenly Immortal.<br>Originally, they were determined to make Chu Feng pay for his actions.<br>However, upon finding out that Chu Feng was Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son, they began to hesitate.<br>To be exact, they were slightly afraid.<br>Who was Chu Xuanyuan? They had heard about him, and knew very well who he was. In fact, when mentioning Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s name, the majority of their clan&rsquo;s seniors would reveal fear and reverence.<br>In the eyes of many people, Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s life was akin to a god&rsquo;s life. The reason for that was because what he had accomplished were things that were impossible for mortals to accomplish.<br>Seeing Chu Feng revealing his strength, they were already extremely surprised at how someone as young as Chu Feng was capable of such unimaginable abilities.<br>However, upon finding out that Chu Feng was actually Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son, they were no longer surprised by Chu Feng. Instead, they felt that what Chu Feng was capable of was only to be expected.<br>After all, Chu Xuanyuan was also someone who trained in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.<br>Moreover, not only was Chu Xuanyuan himself extremely outstandingly powerful, but his father, Chu Hanxian, was also a heaven-defying genius whose name had shaken the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>Thinking about it, how could Chu Hanxian&rsquo;s grandson, Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son, be an ordinary individual?<br>For someone like him, he would astonish the world with a single brilliant feat.<br>To become enemies with someone like that was something that they needed to consider carefully.<br>As such, after the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen found out who Chu Feng was, they began to feel slightly afraid.<br>&ldquo;Humph, just because you&rsquo;re Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son, you dare commit such outrages?&rdquo; That rank eight Heavenly Immortal asked coldly.<br>Compared to his clansmen&rsquo;s change in attitude, he was still looking at Chu Feng with killing intent in his eyes, killing intent which had increased upon finding out who he was.<br>&ldquo;You all know very well what sort of behavior your clansmen are capable of. Thus, I am disinclined to argue with you all as to who is right and wrong in what happened here today.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I have also not stayed here for the sake of arguing with you all. Instead, I stayed because there is one thing that I need you all to understand,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Hearing those words, that rank eight Heavenly Immortal lightly smiled. He asked, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you tell me what it is that you want us to understand?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The person who made your Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen kneel on the ground is I, Chu Feng, alone.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, I hope that you all will target me alone should you wish to obtain revenge for them, and not implicate my clansmen,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br></p></div>
