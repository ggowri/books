        <h1>Chapter 2589</h1>
        <div> - Sequence Of Events<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;This subordinate is the current clan chief of the guardian clan. I also know that Young Master Chu Feng does not wish to reveal his identity. Thus&hellip; this subordinate has not exposed Young Master Chu Feng&rsquo;s identity to anyone. I have also concealed my own identity,&rdquo; The guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief said.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng finally realized why the guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief had to distance himself from Kong Shunlian and Kong Yuehua when telling Chu Feng these things.<br>Evidently, even the two of them had no idea that this mysterious True Immortal-level expert was actually the clan chief of the guardian clan in charge of guarding the Hundred Refinements Stage.<br>&ldquo;Senior, I am actually no longer a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Hearing what Chu Feng said, the guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief was slightly startled. Then, he said, &ldquo;This subordinate has no idea what happened between Young Master Chu Feng and the Chu Heavenly Clan. However, it remains that the blood that flows through Young Master Chu Feng is the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s blood. In the eyes of this subordinate, you are my master.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In that case, how did you find out that I am from the Chu Heavenly Clan? Was my identity revealed when I entered the Hundred Refinements Stage?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Indeed. Ever since that day, this subordinate has been secretly protecting Young Master Chu Feng. I have done so all the way up to two years ago, when the Kong Heavenly Clan attacked Young Master Chu Feng,&rdquo; The guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief said.<br>&ldquo;Senior, I have truly troubled you,&rdquo; Chu Feng felt very grateful. After all, Chu Feng and the guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief had only encountered each other once. Yet, the guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief was able to treat him like this. From this, it could be seen how loyal and devoted the guardian clan was toward the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;Putt~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief kneeled onto the ground. He said, &ldquo;Young Master Chu Feng, please don&rsquo;t address this subordinate as &lsquo;senior&rsquo; anymore. This subordinate isn't qualified for such respect.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Quickly get up,&rdquo; Chu Feng hurriedly helped the guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief back up. He said, &ldquo;If you consider me your master, then listen to me. From today onwards, you are to address me as Chu Feng. And I&hellip; will address you as senior.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo; The guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief started to hesitate.<br>&ldquo;Else&hellip; you do not have to continue to protect me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No matter how you view me, I do not wish to accept a master and servant relationship. After all, in my heart, I am no longer a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; Chu Feng said in a very serious manner.<br>&ldquo;Very well. In that case, I will do as Young Master Chu Feng says. No&hellip; Chu Feng,&rdquo; The guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief corrected himself.<br>&ldquo;Senior, can you tell me the situation with Zhao Hong?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; The guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief nodded. Then, he began to narrate to Chu Feng what had happened during that period of time.<br>Two years ago, in the battle against the Kong Heavenly Clan, Chu Feng was under the influence of the Evil God Sword and was about to lose himself.<br>With no other option, the guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief followed Chu Feng&rsquo;s request and brought Kong Yuehua, Kong Shunlian and Wang Qiang away from the Kong Heavenly Clan.<br>Both Kong Yuehua and Kong Shunlian were shocked by that battle. They began to doubt and distrust their clan.<br>Thus, they did not return to the Kong Heavenly Clan. In fact, some people even thought that they were dead.<br>The two of them had been staying together with the guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief and Wang Qiang the entire time.<br>As the guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief and Wang Qiang were worried about Chu Feng&rsquo;s safety, they went all over the place to search for Chu Feng&rsquo;s whereabouts. However, they were not able to find anything.<br>Not long afterward, the news of Chu Feng&rsquo;s death began to spread. Although they were skeptical of the news, they still slightly believed it.<br>Because of that, Wang Qiang grew extremely hateful toward the Kong Heavenly Clan, and vowed to make the Kong Heavenly Clan pay. After that, Wang Qiang found Zhao Hong. At that time, Zhao Hong also knew about what had happened, and also hated the Kong Heavenly Clan to the bone.<br>With that, the two of them began to plan how to take revenge upon the Kong Heavenly Clan.<br>Both Kong Shunlian and Kong Yuehua knew about the matter.<br>That said, even though the two of them were both part of the Kong Heavenly Clan, they were righteous people, and were capable of distinguishing gratitude and grudges.<br>They felt that the Kong Heavenly Clan was in the wrong in regards to what had happened to Chu Feng. Thus, even though they knew that Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang were planning to take revenge upon the Kong Heavenly Clan, they did not stop them. Instead, they chose to enter closed-door training.<br>The place where they chose to enter their closed-door training was precisely this vast desert.<br>Although Kong Shunlian and Kong Yuehua entered closed-door training, the guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief did not trust them.<br>He feared that Kong Shunlian and Kong Yuehua possessed ulterior motives, and would secretly attack Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong.<br>Thus, the guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief decided to stay and overlook the two of them as they continued with their closed-door training.<br>Furthermore, upon finding out that Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong wanted to become stronger, he wanted to help them. Thus, he told them the location of all the remnants that he knew of.<br>In the past two years, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong had traveled back and forth from remnant to remnant. It was actually all thanks to the guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief that the two of them managed to increase their cultivation so quickly.<br>Among the remnants that the guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief told Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong about was the Unknown Burial Ground.<br>&ldquo;In the end, that girl Zhao Hong lied to me.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt helpless. Although Zhao Hong had told him that the remnant she was going to enter was dangerous, she mentioned to him that she had been in that remnant before. Furthermore, she spoke with great confidence. Thus, Chu Feng decided to let her go.<br>However, looking at things now, that wasn&rsquo;t the case at all.<br>When Zhao Hong returned to the vast desert and expressed her desire to enter the Unknown Burial Ground, the guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief was against it. In fact, even Kong Yuehua and Kong Shunlian were against it.<br>However, Zhao Hong insisted on entering the remnant. Furthermore, she was extremely confident. Unable to get through her stubbornness, the guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief took out a treasure.<br>It was a treasure allowing one to teleport a short distance. Regardless of where one might be, one would be able to teleport to a fixed location after using that treasure.<br>Naturally, the guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief set the location for Zhao Hong to be teleported to outside of the Unknown Burial Ground.<br>Furthermore, the guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief demanded that Zhao Hong must withdraw from the Unknown Burial Ground should she encounter danger; that she must not force herself.<br>Zhao Hong accepted his demands without hesitation.<br>However, the guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief was still worried for Zhao Hong. Thus, he took out another treasure, a treasure capable of assimilating with Zhao Hong&rsquo;s soul.<br>If Zhao Hong was injured, in fatal danger or dead, that treasure would respond to all of those.<br>And the situation at hand was that Zhao Hong was in fatal danger. Furthermore, she was injured. However, even with that being the case, Zhao Hong still did not use the treasure to teleport back.<br>Furthermore, only those below True Immortal level of cultivation were capable of entering the Unknown Burial Ground.<br>Thus, even though the guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief wanted to enter and inspect the situation inside, he was unable to do so.<br>With no other option, he decided to send that letter to Chu Feng.<br><br></p></div>
