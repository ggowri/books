        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>&ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ll be able to live,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What makes you think so?&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Elder, even though you are using me to enter the Star Sea Realm, you have helped me greatly along the way. There&rsquo;s no reason for you to have done that. You could have threatened me right from the start and forced me to do your bidding. However, you didn&rsquo;t do so. This shows that you are a person with principles,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>Chaotic Era Scholar smiled.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong, Chu Feng. I am not a good person. I can spare you, but you have to do something for me,&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Do you want me to enter the palace?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>That was the only thing he could think of that Chaotic Era Scholar might want from him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just you but all of you,&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar said.</span><br><span>With a wave of his sleeves, he released three bundles of light toward the foreheads of Chu Feng, Jie Tian, and Little Fishy. These bundles of light were formations.</span><br><span>Uwa</span><span>!</span><br><span>Jie Tian grabbed his head and cried in agony. Little Fishy clutched her head with a pained look. Only Chu Feng looked unfazed, though he couldn&rsquo;t understand why the two of them were in so much pain whereas he was fine.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I have imposed a restriction against the three of you harboring killing intent toward one another. The two of you are in pain right now because you carry killing intent toward each other. Control your killing intent, and you&rsquo;ll be spared from the pain of the formation,&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar said.</span><br><span>Moments later, Little Fishy and Jie Tian&rsquo;s conditions improved after following Chaotic Era Scholar&rsquo;s instructions to suppress their killing intent. This showed that Chaotic Era Scholar&rsquo;s formation was truly frightening, as it could actually detect their killing intent.</span><br><span>&ldquo;The three of you are on the same boat now. Fight among yourselves if you wish to die; you might not even survive even if you work together with one another. I want the three of you to open that door, enter the palace, and clear all of the trials inside. I&rsquo;ll kill the three of you if you fail to clear the trials and obtain what I want,&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar said.</span><br><span>Chu Feng&rsquo;s surroundings were suddenly distorted. By the time everything reverted to normal, he had already been transported back to the palace&rsquo;s entrance together with Chaotic Era Scholar and the others.</span><br><span>Chaotic Era Scholar pointed at the palace, and a formation surfaced. The formation had three formation cores&mdash;two of them could be channeled using spirit power, whereas the last one was using martial power.</span><br><span>&ldquo;He constructed a formation that allows one to combine martial power and spirit power?&rdquo; Chu Feng was astonished.</span><br><span>As a world spiritist, he knew how difficult it was to construct a formation like that. Chaotic Era Scholar must have reached an incredible height in his world spiritist </span><span>techniques to be able to accomplish such inconceivable feats with ease.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Begin,&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar ordered.</span><br><span>Chu Feng immediately stepped into the formation core.</span><br><span>Little Fishy did the same as well, knowing better than to fight back. She had wisely chosen not to say a word since Chaotic Era Scholar&rsquo;s appearance, knowing that her standing held no significance here. Her family wouldn&rsquo;t even know the cause of her death if the other party killed her here.</span><br><span>Jie Tian was no fool either. He obediently entered the formation core.</span><br><span>The formation was extremely powerful. With the three of them channeling it together, it didn&rsquo;t take long for the palace doors, which Jie Tian had previously struggled with, to creak open.</span><br><span>With that, Chu Feng and the others made their way into the palace.</span><br><span>As soon as Chu Feng approached the door, he immediately understood why Chaotic Era Scholar was unable to enter the palace himself. There was an invisible barrier at the entrance strong enough to impede him, but more important than that, there was an unfathomable power lurking inside the palace.</span><br><span>This unfathomable power felt like neither ordinary spirit power nor martial power, but it was extremely powerful. In fact, it was even stronger than the core formation of the Star Sea Realm, the source of spirit power here. It was at an entirely different level to everything else.</span><br><span>Chaotic Era Scholar must have recruited Chu Feng and the others&rsquo; help because he knew how formidable the power was.</span><br><span>The only problem was that the barrier blocked not just Chaotic Era Scholar but Chu Feng too. Little Fishy and Jie Tian were able to get in just fine, though.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Elder, I can&rsquo;t pass through the barrier. I suspect that only those who have cleared the Immemorial Star Sea&rsquo;s trial are qualified to enter the palace,&rdquo; Chu Feng turned around and told Chaotic Era Scholar.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Find a way to do it. I know you can. You can be certain I&rsquo;ll kill you too if the two of them fail the palace&rsquo;s trial,&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Elder, it&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t want to enter but I really am unable to.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t lying. He truly wasn&rsquo;t able to enter the palace, or else he would have never left Little Fishy alone with Jie Tian.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Let me help you,&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar said.</span><br><span>He walked up to Chu Feng before pressing his palm on the back of his head. A gentle but powerful surge of spirit power flowed into Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Use your Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes to study the barrier,&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar said.</span><br><span>As a matter of fact, Chu Feng had already activated his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, but the surge of energy from Chaotic Era Scholar allowed him to see things that had previously eluded his sight. This wasn&rsquo;t the first time such a thing happened. Ever since he entered the Star Sea Realm, his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes had been exceptionally potent.</span><br><span>He had been confused why that was the case, but it was clear now that Chaotic Era Scholar had been secretly lending him a helping hand. It was just that the latter had previously done it so discreetly that it eluded his notice.</span><br><span>In other words, Chu Feng&rsquo;s Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes were much stronger than usual now.</span><br><span>Through his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, he figured out a solution to his problem and constructed a concealment formation around himself. Nevertheless, his face still warped in pain when he tried to enter the barrier.</span><br><span>Even with the concealment formation, it was no easy feat for him to pass through the barrier. After all, his spirit power was far weaker than the level of the formations here. Still, he gritted his teeth and pushed his way through the barrier.</span><br><span>At this point, the evil power manifested next to Chaotic Era Scholar, but it was no longer a hundred thousand meters tall black aura monster but a </span><span>ten-meter tall</span><span> physical body. Its unruly disposition had been reined in, making it seem more like a servant.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Milord, why didn&rsquo;t you help him? You could have enhanced his spirit power so that he can easily pass through the barrier,&rdquo; the evil power asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;He needs to do it himself, or else there&rsquo;ll be issues later on. Don&rsquo;t underestimate the Immemorial Star Sea,&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I have been here for many years but I still haven&rsquo;t obtained what milord wants. I dare not underestimate the Immemorial Star Sea,&rdquo; the evil power said with a bitter smile.</span><br><span>It had regained all its memories.</span><br><span>It had entered the Star Sea Realm during the Ancient Era and had been lying under cover since then. Despite many years of preparation and acclimatization, it remained incapable of showing its true self here. It was only when its strength suddenly started growing in recent days that it was finally able to show itself.</span><br><span>But now, it knew that there was a reason behind the abrupt growth in its strength. It happened to coincide with the time of Chu Feng&rsquo;s entry into the Star Sea Realm. In other words, it had grown stronger thanks to Chaotic Era Scholar&rsquo;s intervention.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You have been spreading damage to the Star Sea Realm by infiltrating this place with my formation. It took some time, but you managed to significantly damage the Immemorial Star Sea&rsquo;s protective formation. Otherwise, the protective formation would have noticed me even if I possessed Chu Feng&rsquo;s body. I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to get in here at all. You have already accomplished the mission I have entrusted to you,&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar said.</span><br><span>The evil power was taken aback. It finally realized that Chaotic Era Scholar had never counted on him to obtain the Immemorial Star Sea&rsquo;s secret. Its mission had only been to destroy the protective formation so that Chaotic Era Scholar could enter the Star Sea Realm.</span></p></div>
