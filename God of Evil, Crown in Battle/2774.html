        <div> - The Dao Of Chess<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Before the crowd&rsquo;s focus, Chu Feng began to control his chess piece army.<br>Unlike the matches against Yuwen Hualong and Yuwen Tingyi, Chu Feng did not directly command his chess piece army to confront Han Yu&rsquo;s chess piece army.<br>Instead, Chu Feng&rsquo;s chess pieces actually started to set up a formation, a defensive formation. Chu Feng had chosen to be passive and defend.<br>&ldquo;Humph.&rdquo;<br>Seeing this, Han Yu snorted. He thought to himself, &lsquo;There are some people that you are simply unable to defend against. For example, me.&rsquo;<br>Thinking that, Han Yu stopped having his chess piece army slowly proceed onward. Instead, he accelerated the speed of his army.<br>In the blink of an eye, Han Yu&rsquo;s chess piece army arrived before Chu Feng&rsquo;s chess piece army and collided with it.<br>At that moment, the gazes of the crowd all turned especially bright.<br>The crowd were all focused on the chessboard. They did not want to miss the slightest bit of that wonderful sight.<br>Han Yu did not disappoint the crowd. His chess piece army was simply invincible. Chu Feng&rsquo;s chess pieces started to die by Han Yu&rsquo;s chess pieces repeatedly.<br>In the blink of an eye, Han Yu&rsquo;s chess pieces army had penetrated Chu Feng&rsquo;s chess piece army.<br>However, soon, the crowd came to find out that as Han Yu&rsquo;s chess piece army penetrated further into Chu Feng&rsquo;s chess piece army, they actually started dying too.<br>At that moment, astonishment filled the eyes of everyone present.<br>How could Han Yu&rsquo;s extremely powerful chess pieces be killed by Chu Feng&rsquo;s chess pieces? This was simply unreasonable.<br>It was one thing for Han Yu&rsquo;s chess pieces to die when many of Chu Feng&rsquo;s chess pieces surrounded a single one of Han Yu&rsquo;s chess pieces to kill it. However, even one against one, Han Yu&rsquo;s chess pieces were still dying to Chu Feng&rsquo;s chess pieces.<br>Soon, the crowd discovered that while the chess pieces might be fighting one on one, Chu Feng&rsquo;s chess pieces were different from Han Yu&rsquo;s chess pieces.<br>After observing, the crowd soon discovered that both Chu Feng and Han Yu possessed different sorts of chess pieces.<br>There were multiple different types of chess pieces. Not only did the chess pieces have different appearances, but it seemed that their usage and battle powers were different too.<br>Gradually, the crowd realized which sort of chess pieces were stronger and which sort of chess pieces were weaker.<br>As for the strongest sort of chess pieces, they were the ones that Chu Feng used to kill Han Yu&rsquo;s chess pieces one on one.<br>Han Yu also possessed those sorts of chess pieces with great individual strength.<br>Unfortunately, Han Yu&rsquo;s chess pieces with great individual strength were all surrounded and killed by Chu Feng&rsquo;s seemingly weakest chess pieces.<br>Even though those chess pieces were very powerful, they were unable to match the cumulative power of Chu Feng&rsquo;s weakest chess pieces.<br>Rather than saying that Chu Feng&rsquo;s chess pieces won through numbers, it would be more accurate to say that the chess pieces possessed weaknesses and strengths toward different types of chess pieces.<br>That&rsquo;s right, they possessed the property of curbing one another. The crowd had already realized all this.<br>Han Yu had also realized this. However, it was already too late.<br>By the time Han Yu realized that those chess pieces were capable of curbing one another, it was already too late.<br>The reason for that was because Han Yu had already entered a disadvantaged state, he had already been forced into desperate straits by Chu Feng.<br>Even though his chess pieces possessed stronger overall strength compared to Chu Feng&rsquo;s chess pieces at the start of the match, his most crucial chess pieces had all been killed by Chu Feng&rsquo;s chess pieces already.<br>Thus, his overall strength was much inferior to Chu Feng&rsquo;s at this moment.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng had discovered the secret to the chess pieces.<br>Furthermore, he had set up a formation that acted as a perfect trap for Han Yu to fall into.<br>The current Han Yu was akin to a turtle in a jar. He was completely trapped by Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I refuse to believe that I&rsquo;ll lose!&rdquo;<br>Han Yu was feeling extremely unreconciled. He once again unleashed a boundless amount of spirit power. Wave upon wave of his spirit power began to flow into his remaining chess pieces in an unending stream.<br>Unfortunately, even with this seemingly unstoppable power infusing the chess pieces, he was unable to change the inevitable.<br>At that moment, Han Yu was no longer able to turn that losing battle around. In the end, all of his chess pieces were killed by Chu Feng&rsquo;s chess pieces.<br>When Han Yu&rsquo;s chess pieces were all killed by Chu Feng&rsquo;s chess pieces, Chu Feng still had twelve chess pieces remaining.<br>It was a triumph for Chu Feng. It was a much more marvelous victory compared to his matches against Yuwen Hualong and Yuwen Tingyi.<br>At that moment, the crowd was completely stunned. Some among them were even rubbing their eyes nonstop.<br>They did not dare to believe the scene before them. They did not dare to believe that Chu Feng had actually achieved an overwhelming victory against Han Yu.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re shameless!!!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a shout even more ear-piercing than thunder brought the crowd back from their stunned state with shock.<br>It was Han Yu. At that moment, Han Yu had a furious look on his face and was pointing at Chu Feng with his finger.<br>Han Yu no longer possessed his previous calmness. At that moment, he resembled a person on the verge of losing all rationality.<br>&ldquo;Shameless? How am I, Chu Feng, shameless?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked in a very puzzled manner.<br>&ldquo;It was impossible for you to defeat me. Yet, you&rsquo;ve defeated me. You dare to say that you&rsquo;re still not shameless?! Tell me, exactly what sort of shameless means did you use?!&rdquo; Han Yu asked.<br>&ldquo;Haha&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng laughed. Then, he said, &ldquo;A game of chess has always been a game of intelligence, resourcefulness and the utilization of one&rsquo;s chess pieces.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, what did you do? You merely infused the chess pieces with your formidable spirit power. After that, you urged them to attack my chess pieces without the slightest bit of strategy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Your way of playing chess is simply akin to a novice that knows literally nothing trying to fight against someone who knows how to play chess. Let me ask, how could you possibly win?&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;This chessboard compares one&rsquo;s spirit power. There&rsquo;s no such thing as the utilization of one&rsquo;s chess pieces,&rdquo; Han Yu said.<br>&ldquo;Haha&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng laughed again. He did not try to explain.<br>&ldquo;What are you laughing about? Are you tacitly agreeing?&rdquo; Han Yu asked.<br>&ldquo;Young master Han Yu, you are wrong,&rdquo; right at that moment, that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder said.<br>&ldquo;Young master Han Yu, you have misunderstood the essence of the chessboard.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If it were merely used to compete with one&rsquo;s spirit power, one could very well just compete using world spirit techniques. There would simply be no use for this chessboard.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;While it is undeniable that the strength of one&rsquo;s spirit power will affect the strength of one&rsquo;s chess pieces, it is also because of that that you were deceived by the chessboard. You felt that since your spirit power was stronger, you would be able to defeat young master Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, you&rsquo;ve forgotten the most important aspect of playing chess: one&rsquo;s skill. It is not a competition of spirit power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, you do not have to feel disappointed. After all, it is not only you who was deceived by the chessboard. I believe many others present were deceived by it,&rdquo; after the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder said those words, he turned his gaze to the crowd.<br>Facing the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder&rsquo;s gaze, the crowd, with the exception of a few extremely confident individuals, all nodded their heads slightly to indicate that they too were deceived by the chessboard.<br>Indeed, practically everyone had thought that what the chessboard competed in would be one&rsquo;s world spirit techniques. Else, they wouldn&rsquo;t have been that certain that Chu Feng would be undoubtedly defeated.<br>However, from the confrontation between Chu Feng and Han Yu, the crowd realized that the chess pieces actually possessed different strengths. It turned out that one&rsquo;s utilization of the chess pieces was extremely important in a game of chess.<br>They were all deceived. Because of that, they had forgotten the dao of chess.<br><br><br>Check out the June Giveaway for a chance to win $200, $100 or $50 Visa Gift Card<br><br><br></p></div>
