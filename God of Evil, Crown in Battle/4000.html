        <div> - The Fox Spirit&rsquo;s Threat<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon discovering the truth, even though the fox spirit was also very astonished, her astonishment only lasted for a short period of time before disappearing from her face.<br>Soon, the corners of her mouth rose into a smile.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that I truly cannot underestimate you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The key that you forged earlier was truly forged well.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even those ripples must&rsquo;ve been deliberately planned by you, right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I must say, when those ripples enveloped my body, I truly thought that I had been freed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thoroughly deceived by you,&rdquo; the fox spirit said with a praising tone.<br>&ldquo;You flatter me.&rdquo; Chu Feng clasped his fist shamelessly. He was immensely pleased with himself.<br>&ldquo;How did you know that no one had managed to successfully remove the lock before you?&rdquo; asked the fox spirit.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very easy to guess. If someone had managed to successfully remove your lock, you wouldn&rsquo;t be standing here, and I wouldn&rsquo;t have encountered you,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You are truly daring,&rdquo; said the fox spirit.<br>&ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You guessed everything without any basis. Yet, you dared to attempt them. You were actually gambling.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You were gambling that I would not be able to harm you as long as you did not remove my lock,&rdquo; said the fox spirit.<br>&ldquo;I guess you can say it was a gamble. However, the course of events is not what&rsquo;s important. What&rsquo;s important is the outcome.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if I was gambling, I at least won my gamble,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;Little fellow, what is your name?&rdquo; asked the fox spirit.<br>&ldquo;I will not tell you,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very cautious.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, that&rsquo;s alright. I&rsquo;ve remembered your face.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will find you. At that time, you&rsquo;d best not cry.&rdquo;<br>As the fox spirit spoke, she flipped her palm, and an item floated out from it.<br>It was a black body of light.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, that body of light spread out and turned into a spirit formation gate.<br>That spirit formation gate was open. Through the gate, one could see what was inside.<br>That gate seemed like an entrance to a world.<br>Inside that gate was a place filled with stars. It was the vast Outer World.<br>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to properly experience this world.&rdquo;<br>As the fox spirit spoke, she began to walk towards the spirit formation gate.<br>However, after she took a step into the spirit formation gate, she turned around and looked at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You should pray that I do not find you.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, the fox spirit smiled wickedly.<br>Her smile was so very beautiful, so very enchanting.<br>However, when Chu Feng saw that enchanting smile, he felt his heart tense up.<br>That was a very dangerous smile. It was like a warning and a threat. However, more than either of those, it was like a reminder.<br>She was reminding Chu Feng with her smile what sort of terrifying thing would happen to him the next time he saw her.<br>After the fox spirit entered the spirit formation gate, the gate immediately closed.<br>&ldquo;That fox spirit has quite a few treasures.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The treasures she gave me earlier must be junk.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;She'd clearly stripped naked earlier. Exactly where did she hide all her treasures?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng sighed. &ldquo;A fox spirit is a fox spirit. Truly cunning.&rdquo;<br>The reason why he was sighing was because he could tell that the spirit formation gate the fox spirit had opened earlier was done using a treasure.<br>Whilst that was the power of a treasure, it was rather remarkable in that the gate resembled a teleportation gate.<br>Furthermore, the teleportation gate had a very far range.<br>Most amazing of all, one could reach the destination instantly, even though it was extremely far away, just by stepping into the teleportation gate.<br>That was an enormous formation that disregarded distance.<br>Of course, Chu Feng could not be certain if the teleportation gate could bring that fox spirit anywhere she wanted to go.<br>However, even if it was only effective for a designated location, possessing such power was still enough to prove that it was a priceless treasure.<br>Earlier, the fox spirit had given Chu Feng some treasures.<br>Those treasures all contained special powers.<br>However, none of those treasures could compare to the spirit formation gate the fox spirit had opened earlier.<br>That was the reason why Chu Feng was sighing with regret. He was sighing at how cunning the fox spirit was.<br>&ldquo;Fortunately, I am no fool myself.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng smiled and carefully examined himself.<br>His current appearance was not even that of Asura.<br>Instead, his appearance was that of the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s disciple Wang Chen.<br>The words spoken by the fox spirit earlier had fully revealed her intention to retaliate against Chu Feng.<br>However, since she didn&rsquo;t even know his actual identity, how was she supposed to retaliate against him?<br>Even if Chu Feng were to expose himself as Asura, Asura was also a fake identity.<br>As long as she didn&rsquo;t know his actual identity as the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Chu Feng, he did not have to worry about her revenge at all.<br>Not only would he not be harmed by her, but even his relatives and friends would not be implicated.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that it&rsquo;s about time to leave this place.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;They must&rsquo;ve placed an inescapable net for me outside.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let me examine the situation outside with the power of the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak first.&rdquo;<br>Even though Chu Feng knew that it was very dangerous outside, he didn't panic at all.<br>Ignoring the fact that the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak was able to conceal him, even if the concealment of the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak was to be exposed, he still had the Mystic Cave Saints&rsquo; grand formation.<br>Chu Feng trusted the ability of the Mystic Cave Saints. He felt that they would not have him do something that they did not have certainty of success in.<br>&hellip;...<br>Actually, the moment Chu Feng had passed through the sea of lightning that sealed the sky and fused the five weapons into one, the disciples of the six great powers had all begun to leave.<br>Through the closest spirit formation gates, they returned outside.<br>At that moment, practically all of the six great powers&rsquo; disciples had withdrawn from the spirit formation world.<br>After withdrawing from it, they finally learned that the Wang Chen who had been exercising magical powers in the spirit formation world was actually a fake.<br>Someone had borrowed Wang Chen&rsquo;s appearance to sneak their way inside with the intention to steal their treasures.<br>Because of that, the crowd all felt inconsolable hatred for Chu Feng.<br>However, the surroundings were extremely quiet.<br>Everyone was waiting for Chu Feng&rsquo;s return.<br>At the same time, they were panicking somewhat.<br>After all, the stone case world was mysterious and unfathomable. They were afraid that Chu Feng would no longer be in the stone case world, and that he had instead escaped far away using the power of the stone case world. What were they to do if that happened?<br>At that moment, the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster questioned in a slightly nervous manner, &ldquo;Why has he still not appeared after so long? He couldn&rsquo;t have&hellip; already escaped?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, I&rsquo;ve sealed this place with my treasure.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As long as he exits that place, he will definitely be detected. No matter how powerful of a concealment ability he might possess, he will still be fully exposed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unless&hellip;&rdquo;<br>When his words reached this point, the Dragon Phoenix Immortal Pavilion&rsquo;s pavilion master revealed a worried look.<br>&ldquo;Unless what?&rdquo; asked the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster.<br>&ldquo;Unless he&rsquo;s no longer in there. Unless he left the stone case world using special methods.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, it would be meaningless even if we are to stand guard here,&rdquo; said the Dragon Phoenix Immortal Pavilion&rsquo;s pavilion master.<br>&ldquo;......&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the leaders of the six great powers all started frowning.<br>That was actually what they were afraid of the most.<br>&ldquo;Ling, ling, ling~~~&rdquo;<br>However, all of a sudden, a series of rings sounded.<br>Hearing those rings, the Dragon Phoenix Immortal Pavilion&rsquo;s pavilion master was overjoyed.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that he&rsquo;s still inside.&rdquo;<br></p></div>
