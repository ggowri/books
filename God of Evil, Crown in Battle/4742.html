        <div>: Successful Forging<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though Li Muzhi and Lu Long weren&rsquo;t in a good position to stand up for Chu Feng, the latter didn&rsquo;t seem fazed by the pressure exerted by Xu Langzhi and the others at all. It was as if this matter had nothing to do with him at all.<br>His attitude made Xu Langzhi and the others even more infuriated.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you need to give us an explanation,&rdquo; Xu Langzhi said with a forceful tone.<br>It looked as if he would pursue this matter to the end as long as Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t give a satisfactory explanation.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. I can accept a failure or two, but I can&rsquo;t allow it to continue like this. I&rsquo;ve already given you a chance, but you refused to treasure it. Since that&rsquo;s the case, you shouldn&rsquo;t blame me for this then,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Everyone was surprised to hear those words.<br>Li Muzhi asked directly, &ldquo;Junior Chu Feng, what do you mean by that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior Li, get Xu Langzhi to back out here and hand his formation core over to me too. I promise you that the forging will be successful,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what do you mean by this?&rdquo; Xu Langzhi roared in displeasure.<br>&ldquo;You know deep well what I mean. I don&rsquo;t want to waste my breath with you.&rdquo; Chu Feng turned to Li Muzhi and continued on, &ldquo;Senior Li, if I still am not able to succeed later on, I&rsquo;ll let you do as you deem fit.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Junior Chu, are you certain?&rdquo; Li Muzhi asked with a frown.<br>He had already understood what Chu Feng meant.<br>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m certain about this,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied affirmatively.<br>&ldquo;Very well, I&rsquo;ll let you do it your way. Senior Xu, you should back down for the time being,&rdquo; Li Muzhi turned to Xu Langzhi and said.<br>&ldquo;Junior Li, we&rsquo;ve already known one another for so many years. Do you trust him more than me?&rdquo; Xu Langzhi looked deeply indignant.<br>&ldquo;Senior Xu, Junior Chu Feng has already made it clear. What can I do? Let&rsquo;s just do it this once. If it still doesn&rsquo;t work, I&rsquo;ll allow you to deal with Junior Chu Feng however you want.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Li Muzhi turned to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Junior Chu Feng, what do you think about it?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I have no qualms with that.&rdquo; Chu Feng shrugged nonchalantly.<br>As for Xu Langzhi, he seemed to be deep in thought for a moment before he finally made up his mind.<br>&ldquo;Fine. I&rsquo;ll agree to this on Junior Li&rsquo;s account. However, Chu Feng, I&rsquo;ll make it clear first. This is your final chance. If you still fail over here, you need not dream of walking out of here with your own two feet!&rdquo;<br>Xu Langzhi glared at Chu Feng coldly before finally walking out of the formation core.<br>Chu Feng turned a blind eye to Xu Langzhi&rsquo;s threat, responding with just a calm smile. He proceeded to release his spirit power and meld the formation core Xu Langzhi was using earlier on with his own formation core.<br>Previously, Chu Feng was only guiding the flow of energy from the supporting formation, so they weren&rsquo;t able to sense Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power. However, this time around, Chu Feng was exerting his full power, such that they could feel the tremendous prowess of his spirit power fully.<br>His spirit power had already reached a level comparable to that of a rank eight Utmost Exalted level cultivator, towering far above all of them.<br>&ldquo;Junior Chu Feng, you&hellip; you have already reached rank four Dragon Transformation Sensation?&rdquo; Li Muzhi couldn&rsquo;t help but ask.<br>&ldquo;Just like the rest of you, I&rsquo;m still at rank three Dragon Transformation Sensation,&rdquo; replied Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible. Your spirit power is clearly that of a rank four Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritist,&rdquo; Li Muzhi replied in disbelief.<br>Chu Feng was indeed at rank three Dragon Transformation Sensation, but his world spiritist bloodline and the power of the Nine Dragon Saint Cloak raised his spirit power to a level comparable to that of a rank eight Utmost Exalted level cultivator.<br>However, he simply chuckled softly, not bothering to explain more. He knew that most people couldn&rsquo;t imagine that he was able to raise his spirit power by two ranks through a treasure and bloodline.<br>Under Chu Feng&rsquo;s full prowess, it didn&rsquo;t take long before the formation core Xu Langzhi was in charge of fused together with Chu Feng&rsquo;s.<br>&ldquo;Senior Li, let&rsquo;s begin once you recover your spirit power,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Li Muzhi replied with a nod.<br>A moment later, after Li Muzhi and the others managed to regain their strength, they began the forging process. There were many ingredients placed in the middle of the formation, and these ingredients simply weren&rsquo;t fusing together all this while.<br>But to their surprise, the ingredients actually began fusing together this time around.<br>Eventually, with the Demonsoul Grass as the base, they managed to forge two rings, two bracelets, and two necklaces.<br>&ldquo;It worked! It really worked!&rdquo;<br>Li Muzhi examined the items carefully, only to find that the medicinal energy had fused completely with the treasures. There was no doubt about it&mdash;they had succeeded!<br>&ldquo;Why would it work out this time around?&rdquo;<br>The others were also surprised and delighted, but more than that, they were confused. The success was so abrupt that it caught them by surprise.<br>In any case, they were delighted that things worked out perfectly&hellip; all except for one.<br>That single person felt only fright and horror, and he was no other than Xu Langzhi.<br>Li Muzhi turned eyes filled with rage toward Xu Langzhi and roared, &ldquo;Xu Langzhi, how do you wish to explain this matter?&rdquo;<br>The fact that the forging succeeded as soon as Xu Langzhi backed out showed that the problem lay with him.<br>&ldquo;Junior Li, I&hellip; I also don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on! It must be Chu Feng. He must be messing around with me!&rdquo; Xu Langzhi pointed a finger at Chu Feng as he exclaimed fearfully.<br>&ldquo;Was I the one messing with you, or were you the one who messed with me? Every single formation core is of vital importance in this formation. It&rsquo;s only when everyone gives their all that the forging will succeed. However, you didn&rsquo;t infuse a single sliver of spirit power into the formation earlier on.<br>&ldquo;Junior Li, you can check his spirit power. He didn&rsquo;t use any spirit power earlier, and he still consumed pills to regenerate his spirit power in order to put on the act. If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, he should still be overflowing with spirit power right now, so much that he&rsquo;s going to suffer an internal injury from an excess of it. I reckon that he&rsquo;s probably trying his best to set up formations within his body so as to deplete his spirit power,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Shoosh!<br>Li Muzhi rushed forward to grab Xu Langzhi&rsquo;s wrist in order to check on the latter&rsquo;s spirit power, and his face swiftly turned awful.<br>Eventually, Li Muzhi hurled a fist onto Xu Langzhi&rsquo;s face and bellowed, &ldquo;Xu Langzhi, are you tired of living?!&rdquo;<br>This punch was definitely not for show. It harnessed such great power that it distorted half of Xu Langzhi&rsquo;s face, smashing him into the depths of the sea.<br>Despite so, Xu Langzhi quickly swam back up and kneeled down before Li Muzhi, crying, &ldquo;Junior Li, please forgive me! I was just beguiled for a moment there. I didn&rsquo;t think that Chu Feng would really be able to control the energy of the supporting formation, so I didn&rsquo;t give it my all. I didn&rsquo;t intend to harm him or sabotage you! You should know that I&rsquo;m not that kind of person too!&rdquo;<br>However, Li Muzhi and the other personal disciples who had spoken up for him earlier didn&rsquo;t trust his words at all. They stared at him with a complicated look in their eyes that carried a hint of scorn.<br>The evidence was more than enough to tell what had happened earlier, and there was no way Xu Langzhi could possibly talk his way out of this.<br>&ldquo;Xu Langzhi, to think that I trusted you so much. Scram! From this day onward, you aren&rsquo;t a friend of mine anymore!&rdquo; Li Muzhi roared angrily.<br>&ldquo;Junior Li, I&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Scram!!!&rdquo;<br>Xu Langzhi still wanted to explain his action, but he was met with an infuriated bellow from Li Muzhi. Shockingly, Li Muzhi&rsquo;s voice actually carried a hint of murderous intent.<br>Given so, Xu Langzhi dared not to continue lingering in the area anymore. He quickly rose into the air and left the area.<br>&ldquo;Junior Chu Feng, we apologize for that earlier. We underestimated you earlier.&rdquo;<br>After Xu Langzhi left, the other personal disciples who made things difficult for Chu Feng earlier stepped forward and apologized to Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng knew that they would apologize to him, especially since they were in the presence of Li Muzhi, but unexpectedly, their apology was sincere. They weren&rsquo;t just putting on a show before Li Muzhi here.<br>And what was even more unexpected was that Li Muzhi actually walked up to him and bowed down.<br>&ldquo;Junior Chu Feng, I apologize for everything that has happened.&rdquo;<br>Li Muzhi had a remorseful look on his face, for he knew that he had distrusted Chu Feng for a moment there.<br></p></div>
