        <div> - Unexpected Pleasant Surprise<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Li Xiang and the others asked in a confused manner.<br><br>&ldquo;Do not instill your spirit power into them directly. Use spirit formations,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br><br>&ldquo;But they&hellip;&rdquo; Li Xiang and the others pointed to the great majority of the people present.<br><br>Apart from Han Yu, all of the others that were instilling their spirit power into their glass ball were doing so directly without the use of spirit formations.<br><br>Furthermore, the spirit formation Han Yu had set up was merely a concealing formation. It was done so that others could not see what he was doing. It was uncertain as to whether or not Han Yu was using spirit formations inside.<br><br>Thus, Li Xiang felt that if they were to use spirit formations when all the others were not, it would be somewhat humiliating.<br><br>&ldquo;What others do is their concern. I will only ask you all this, do you all still want to enter the maze formation?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br><br>&ldquo;We do. Of course we do. Why else would we have come here?&rdquo; Li Xiang and his two companions nodded their heads repeatedly.<br><br>&ldquo;Then do as I say. Only start after you&rsquo;ve made absolute preparations,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br><br>&ldquo;Okay. We will do as big brother Chu Feng says, &ldquo;Li Xiang and the others said.<br><br>Had it been before, Chu Feng would not meddle in others&rsquo; business. However, after Li Xiang and his two buddies addressed him as big brother repeatedly, Chu Feng would feel a bit guilty if he ignored them. Furthermore, it was merely some verbal advice, something he didn&rsquo;t have to put any effort into.<br><br>Li Xiang and his two cronies were quite obedient. After they agreed to Chu Feng&rsquo;s advice, they did not immediately start instilling their spirit power into their glass balls. Instead, they all began to set up spirit formations. Furthermore, they were very serious as they set up their spirit formations.<br><br>Seeing this, Chu Feng also set up a concealing formation like the one Han Yu did. He sealed himself within it, then began to set up a spirit formation inside.<br><br>Actually, there was one benefit to a formation. That is, it could increase the power of small-scale spirit formations. Although the effect was not very strong, it would be of some help.<br><br>Chu Feng felt that Han Yu most definitely knew about this. Otherwise, he would not have set up a sealing formation around himself.<br><br>After Chu Feng finished setting up the sealing formation, he began to meticulously set up another spirit formation.<br><br>As for that spirit formation, it was crucial to Chu Feng instilling spirit power into the that glass ball.<br><br>After all, based on the different colors one could bring forth from that glass ball, one would obtain different clues.<br><br>Chu Feng did not know what sort of color he would be able to obtain. However, at the very least, he would have to put forth his greatest effort.<br><br>Precisely because Chu Feng wanted to put forth his greatest effort, he spent an extremely long period of time setting up his spirit formation.<br><br>However, Chu Feng had no idea that during the time when he was wholeheartedly setting up his spirit formation, that Xia Yun&rsquo;er actually also set up a sealing formation before the crowd.<br><br>Her sealing formation was very large. Not only did it seal herself within it, but it also sealed Chu Feng&rsquo;s sealing formation within it.<br><br>&ldquo;What is the Holy Daughter doing?&rdquo;<br><br>At that moment, the crowd, including even the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s younger generations, revealed confused expressions. They were truly confused by Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s action.<br><br>The reason for that was because Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s attitude toward Chu Feng was simply too unusual.<br><br>One should know that while this Holy Daughter was not an ice-cold person, she was someone who would ignore people and cast them far away from her line of sight.<br><br>Normally, it would be extremely difficult for one to even speak to her.<br><br>Yet, Xia Yun&rsquo;er was actually this enthusiastic toward Chu Feng. In fact, she was even setting up a powerful sealing formation to seal both Chu Feng and herself within it of her own accord.<br><br>What exactly was she planning? The crowd were all guessing about this.<br><br>&ldquo;Our Holy Daughter set up her spirit formation because she does not wish for others to know what she is doing.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Thus, I hope that everyone present does not try to examine the situation inside the spirit formation through special methods. Else, if I am to discover someone doing so, do not blame me for being impolite,&rdquo; Elder Xingyi spoke with a threatening tone.<br><br>There were indeed a lot of people that were planning to use various methods to observe the situation inside Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s sealing formation.<br><br>However, after Elder Xingyi said those words, there would naturally not be anyone who would dare to attempt such a thing anymore.<br><br>As for Chu Feng, he was wholly concentrated on setting up his spirit formation, and didn&rsquo;t notice what was happening outside. After Chu Feng finished setting up his spirit formation, he sat cross-legged within it and began to instill his spirit power into the glass ball.<br><br>Due to the fact that Chu Feng had made sufficient preparations, he managed to achieve a miraculous effort from the very start.<br><br>After he began to instill his spirit power into the glass ball, he had managed to turn it purple in merely half an incense stick&rsquo;s worth of time.<br><br>However, Chu Feng did not relax with just this. Instead, he gritted his teeth and continued to maintain his all-out status and continued to instill his spirit power into the glass ball.<br><br>While Chu Feng was instilling his spirit power into the glass ball, Her Lady Queen was keeping track of the time for Chu Feng.<br><br>Originally, Her Lady Queen felt that since Chu Feng was able to turn the glass ball purple in half an incense stick&rsquo;s worth of time, he should be able to turn it golden in an incense stick&rsquo;s worth of time.<br><br>However, even though the time limit was about to arrive, the glass ball was still only purple. Her Lady Queen started to become worried.<br><br>This was human nature. Their desires were boundless.<br><br>If one felt that one would not be able to turn the glass ball golden, then one would naturally not have an extravagant hope in being able to turn the glass ball golden.<br><br>Should that be the case , one would not feel regret even if the glass ball did not turn golden. After all, one would not have an extravagant hope for it to turn golden to begin with.<br><br>However, should one feel that one might be able to turn the glass ball golden, one would attempt to do so. At that time, one would have entrusted one&rsquo;s hope into turning the glass ball golden. Should one fail, one would naturally feel disappointed.<br><br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br><br>Suddenly, that spirit formation let out a sound. At that moment, Chu Feng stopped the continued operation of his spirit formation.<br><br>The reason for that was because he knew he had reached the time limit. Chu Feng was no longer able to continue to instill his spirit power into the glass ball.<br><br>At that moment, Chu Feng stood up and held the glass ball in his hand.<br><br>&ldquo;It would appear that elder did not lie. It is indeed very difficult to turn this glass ball golden,&rdquo; Chu Feng sighed.<br><br>&ldquo;Even you were only able to turn it purple. Likely, the great majority of people will not have even been able to turn it cyan,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br><br>&ldquo;As long as Li Xiang and the others are to take this matter seriously, they should be able to turn it cyan. Merely, those who did not set up spirit formations and proceeded to directly instill their spirit power into the glass balls will likely find it very difficult to turn them cyan,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br><br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br><br>Right at that moment, the glass ball in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand suddenly started to shine dazzlingly.<br><br>Chu Feng lowered his head to look at glass ball. Immediately, his expression changed as joy emerged in his eyes.<br><br>The reason why the glass ball had started to shine was because its color had actually changed. It had turned from purple to gold.<br><br>&ldquo;Wow! It actually changed color. Chu Feng, you&rsquo;ve succeeded. You&rsquo;ve actually managed to successfully turn it golden.&rdquo;<br><br>Her Lady Queen was wild with joy and extremely excited. She was simply even happier than Chu Feng.<br><br>As for Chu Feng, even though he did not react as excitedly as Her Lady Queen, he had a joyous smile on his face the entire time.<br><br>After all, this could be said to be an unexpectedly pleasant surprise.<br><br><br><br><br></p></div>
