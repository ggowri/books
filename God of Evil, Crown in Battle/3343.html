        <div> - Turn Their Scheme Against Them<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Lord Hanpeng, you absolutely must not do that,&rdquo; with an expression of panic, Chu Xuanzhengfa dissuaded Chu Hanpeng.<br>&ldquo;While it&rsquo;s a fact that Chu Feng has the Death Exemption Title Plate, it&rsquo;s also a fact that he poisoned Lord Clan Chief. As such, we absolutely cannot let this matter go like this. Otherwise&hellip; this old man will not be able to account to our clansmen.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There is no margin for discussion.&rdquo;<br>After Chu Hanpeng said those words to Chu Xuanzhengfa, his boundless oppressive might completely restricted Chu Feng, Chu Xuanzhengfa and everyone else from the Law Enforcement Hall.<br>Seeing this scene, Chu Hanqing, Chu Hanyouyou and their accomplices secretly felt delighted.<br>Apart from the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, the hardest person to deal with in the Chu Heavenly Clan would be Chu Hanpeng.<br>And now, even Chu Hanpeng was standing with them. As such, their plot could be said to have been a great success.<br>&ldquo;Milord, you must not, you absolutely must not!!!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There is definitely injustice toward Chu Feng in regards to this matter, he is definitely wrongly accused!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you are to punish Chu Feng like this today, Lord Clan Chief will definitely not let you get away with it once he regains consciousness!&rdquo;<br>Chu Xuanzhengfa shouted frantically. He was not only pleading for leniency, as his tone was filled with anger.<br>&ldquo;If Lord Clan Chief wishes to blame me, this old man will definitely shoulder all the consequences. However, Lord Clan Chief is currently seriously injured, and unable to handle important matters in the clan. As such, this old man is the one to shoulder this great responsibility. Right now, what this old man needs to do is not to worry about whether or not Lord Clan Chief will blame me, but rather whether or not I make the correct decision,&rdquo; Chu Hanpeng said.<br>&ldquo;Even if you are to punish Chu Feng, you shouldn&rsquo;t punish him with the Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform. That is no punishment, for you are going to kill him,&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng poisoned Lord Clan Chief. With how serious of a crime he has committed, he should be punished with being struck by Heavenly Lightnings,&rdquo; Chu Hanpeng spoke with an unyielding tone.<br>After he finished saying those words, Chu Xuanzhengfa spoke no more. Even Chu Feng seemed to have accepted everything.<br>The reason for that was because when Chu Hanpeng said those words, a voice transmission had entered Chu Xuanzhengfa and Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears respectively.<br>&ldquo;The Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform actually greatly resembles the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng ascended to the tenth step of the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps, thus the Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform might not be a bad thing for him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief and I have discussed before whether to let Chu Feng ascend onto the Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform and experience that Heavenly Lightning. Perhaps the Heavenly Lightning might be able to bring enlightenment to Chu Feng. Merely, after we considered the dangers associated with it, we dispelled that thought.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What happened here today is definitely someone&rsquo;s scheme. However, without concrete evidence, it&rsquo;s unsuitable for me to say anything. Furthermore, what&rsquo;s most important right now is Lord Clan Chief&rsquo;s safety. If I don&rsquo;t punish Chu Feng and force him into dire straits, I fear that they won&rsquo;t be willing to leave this matter at that, and might even attempt to murder Lord Clan Chief. After all, as long as Lord Clan Chief awakens, no one will be able to do anything to Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, with the situation at hand, we can only turn their scheme against them.&rdquo;<br>These words were spoken by Chu Hanpeng.<br>After Chu Hanpeng&rsquo;s voice transmission reached them, Chu Feng and Chu Xuanzhengfa both learned that Chu Hanpeng was actually on their side.<br>Otherwise, with Chu Hanpeng&rsquo;s strength, there was simply no need for him to bother with such superfluous words with them.<br>At that moment, both Chu Feng and Chu Xuanzhengfa planned to act as if they&rsquo;d accepted it, and do what Chu Hanpeng said. After all, Chu Feng was also afraid that those schemers would become flustered, and make an attempt to murder Lord Clan Chief.<br>That said, even with that being the case, Chu Feng still swept his gaze across Chu Hanqing, Chu Hanyouyou and the others.<br>Chu Feng was observing them. Since he was going to suffer severe punishment, he wanted to know exactly who was worried about him, and who was taking delight in his misfortune.<br>After that, Chu Feng was brought to the Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform.<br>The Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform was not very tall. It was square-shaped, and appeared to be made of some stone-like material. However, scorch marks were present all over it. Those were the marks left behind from lightning strikes.<br>There were a total of thirty-three pillars in the center of the Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform. Those pillars were not very thick. They were just thick enough to place a single person on top of them. Those pillars were likely used to tie people to the platform.<br>Sure enough, after Chu Feng was brought to the Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform, he was fixed onto one of the pillars and chained using special shackles.<br>The chains seemed to possess some sort of special resonance with the pillar. After Chu Feng was chained, the stone pillar that appeared completely normal began to flicker with faint light.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Soon, thunder began to sound from the sky. At the same time, the sunny and cloudless sky was covered with dense dark clouds.<br>Seeing this, the people that had chained Chu Feng to the pillar immediately withdrew from the platform, for they all knew that the extremely destructive Heavenly Lightning was about to strike from the highest sky.<br>The Heavenly Lightning from the platform was different from that of the Self-Punishment Mysterious Technique.<br>Apart from the Tribulation Lightning from the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique and the Heaven Punishment Mysterious Technique, Tribulation Lightning did not normally pose a fatal threat to one&rsquo;s life at all. Furthermore, Tribulation Lightning would only strike a practitioner undergoing a breakthrough.<br>As for the Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform&rsquo;s lightning, it was different. Not only would it strike at everyone on the Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform, but it would attack both one&rsquo;s soul and one&rsquo;s bloodline.<br>The Heavenly Lightning demanded life.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Soon, a loud sound was heard.<br>That loud sound was particularly ear-piercing. After it was heard, everyone present turned their eyes to the sky.<br>A multi-colored bolt of lightning, like an enormous dragon, emerged from the black clouds above the ninth heaven. With rapid speed, it struck down toward the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm and straight at Chu Feng.<br>At that moment, Chu Xuanzhengfa and Chu Hanpeng were both worried for Chu Feng.<br>Even though they both knew that Chu Feng&rsquo;s resistance toward Heavenly Lightning should be much stronger than other people, none of them could guarantee that he could really withstand the Heavenly Lightning&rsquo;s bombardment.<br></p></div>
