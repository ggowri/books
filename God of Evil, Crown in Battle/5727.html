        <h1>Chapter 5727: A Voice That Echoes Throughout the World of Cultivation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng was currently floating in mid-air, but he hadn&rsquo;t taken a single step at all. He had been standing on the ground earlier, but the ground beneath him had been obliterated from the face of the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not just the ground beneath him. His surroundings had vanished without a trace too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to look extremely far below before he could see anything tangible&mdash;fiery-red lava raging like a ferocious beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was all because the lightning had obliterated everything on the surface. As a matter of fact, the lava would have been decimated as well if the lightning had continued its rampage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Totem Dragon Clansmen were all floating around Chu Feng. They were freed from the restraints of the dragon&rsquo;s beard, but they were all injured. Some of them had even passed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart shook in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That was a close one.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that these people had nearly died because of him. He thought that he had gained a deep understanding of his father&rsquo;s martial power formation by observing it via Protection Bane. Even if he couldn&rsquo;t control it as he pleased, he could at least stop </span><span>it from injuring people whom he wanted to protect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the martial power formation was simply too violent. As soon as he released it, it ran amok like a god beast escaping from its restraints, seeking to destroy everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it did have the power to destroy everything too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had he allowed the martial power formation to do as it pleased, the entire realm and its countless lives would have been wiped from the face of the world. Even his friends would die as well, including the Totem Dragon Clansmen who should have been under his protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Left with no choice, he could only stop the martial power formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was disappointing that he wasted his father&rsquo;s martial power formation here, especially since it was stronger than he had expected. However, he thought that it was worth it when he looked at Long Chengyu, Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span>, and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; Chu Feng suddenly narrowed his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Heaven-devouring </span><span>Qilin</span><span> had devoured the dragon essence he had been nurturing in his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What are you howling at, Little Feng? Didn&rsquo;t you prepare this for me?&rdquo; The Heaven-devouring </span><span>Qilin</span><span> laughed. Sensing Chu Feng&rsquo;s rage, it quickly changed the topic and said, &ldquo;Little Feng, that was a protection formation, right? Not only was it a martial power formation, it was an incredibly powerful one at that. You must have been from a formidable background. It&rsquo;s no wonder I came under your possession.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t fall for its trick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to change the topic here. It wasn&rsquo;t easy for me to break free of the ancestral dragon&rsquo;s secret skill. That dragon essence is my possession. The least you can do is to give me a heads-up before devouring it. What am I supposed to make of this?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was angry, as this dragon essence could have been one of the few remaining treasures the ancestral dragon left behind. It might have been of great importance to the Totem Dragon Clan. He felt guilt-ridden to the Totem Dragon Clan for having taken it away just like that, considering their close relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Fine, fine, I was wrong. I&rsquo;ll give you a heads-up next time. I have already devoured it, and you won&rsquo;t be able to get it out of me even if you kill me now. You should just find an excuse to fool your friends. Wait till I assimilate the dragon essence. I should have no trouble helping you raise your cultivation by two ranks!&rdquo; the Heaven-devouring </span><span>Qilin</span><span> said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng was annoyed, but there was nothing he could do under the current circumstances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart suddenly skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He heard a noise coming from beyond this realm, an extremely far distance away. It could have been a rumble or a roar, but it shook his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Chu Feng murmured as he looked in the direction of the roar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Long Lin, Daoist </span><span>Heavensniffer</span><span>, Beast Shadow, Taishi </span><span>Xingzhong</span><span>, Bai </span><span>Yunqing</span><span>, and everyone else on this realm also heard that roar and looked in its direction. What they didn&rsquo;t know was that this roar could be heard not just in this realm or galaxy, but </span><span>throughout the entire world of cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the world of cultivation, regardless of their cultivation level or the galaxy they were in, heard the roar loud and clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Pulse Ignition Ordinary Realm of the Bloodline Galaxy&rsquo;s Pulse Ignition Starfield, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master stood on a flying warship with his hands behind his back, as he grimly looked in the direction of the Ancestral Martial Galaxy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were bright and deep, glowing with spirit power that didn&rsquo;t belong to him. He was keenly observing what was happening in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy even though it was a far distance away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his confused expression indicated that he was unable to find what he was looking for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Also in the Bloodline Galaxy&rsquo;s Pulse Ignition Ordinary Realm, a middle-aged man and a middle-aged woman in a moving palace also looked in the direction of the Ancestral Martial Galaxy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman wore a simple white dress. She gave off an air of grace and commanded an ethereal disposition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was also dressed in a white robe that looked even simpler than the woman&rsquo;s dress. He was suave, with a bit of beard. He gave off an air of masculinity, and he had domineering eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man was </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span> and </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er&rsquo;s</span><span> father, as well as the incumbent Immortal Sea Fish Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, one of the strongest experts in the world of cultivation. Similarly, the middle-aged woman was </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span> and </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span>&rsquo;s mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Hubby, what do you see?&rdquo; Little </span><span>Fishy&rsquo;s</span><span> mother asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been looking as well, but she didn&rsquo;t notice anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything,&rdquo; the Immortal Sea Fish Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief shook his head and replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Neither did I. But there&rsquo;s no mistaking that roar,&rdquo; Little </span><span>Fishy&rsquo;s</span><span> mother said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless people were gathered in the sky and on the land. They were all experts coming from all over the world of cultivation. All of them were looking in the same direction, having heard the same roar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;The Ancestral Martial Galaxy isn&rsquo;t as simple as it seems. It might have fallen into decline, but it was once the strongest galaxy that ruled the world of cultivation. Its powerhouses aren&rsquo;t around anymore, they had the best resources in the world of cultivation back then. Who knows? There might just be an old monster who has survived to the present day,&rdquo; the Immortal Sea Fish Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief remarked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Hubby, do you mean that&hellip; someone has just emerged from closed-door cultivation?&rdquo; Little </span><span>Fishy&rsquo;s</span><span> mother asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s such a possibility, but I can&rsquo;t confirm it. Even those from the Ancient Era have begun moving in the wake of God&rsquo;s Era, let alone cultivators of the present era,&rdquo; the Immortal Sea Fish Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;The arrival of God&rsquo;s Era doesn&rsquo;t necessarily seem to be a good thing,&rdquo; Little </span><span>Fishy&rsquo;s</span><span> mother said worriedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m around. The Immortal Sea Fish Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief will be fine,&rdquo; the Immortal Sea Fish Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Mm.&rdquo; Little </span><span>Fishy&rsquo;s</span><span> mother nodded, but her worry was still apparent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was not a weakling, but that was the reason she was unnerved by that voice. Most people thought that the galaxy overlords were the rulers of the world of cultivation, but they themselves knew that they weren&rsquo;t in control of everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To this day, there were still places in this world they couldn&rsquo;t step foot on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, a shabby boat was floating right outside the Bloodline Galaxy&rsquo;s Pulse Ignition Ordinary Realm. Zhang </span><span>Yingxiong</span><span> stood at the front of the boat, holding onto a shining copper mirror that gave off an ancient aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The copper mirror was facing the direction of the Ancestral Martial Galaxy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he pried open the boat&rsquo;s curtain, and his master could be seen sitting inside the boat. Needless to say, his master had heard the earlier roar too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike others, his master&rsquo;s eyes remained closed, not bothering to see what was going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Master, what&rsquo;s happening in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy? I can&rsquo;t see anything. Why don&rsquo;t you take a look?&rdquo; Zhang </span><span>Yingxiong</span><span> asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to be so curious. We&rsquo;re about to leave this place anyway. Your battlefield isn&rsquo;t here but the Immemorial Domain of Gods,&rdquo; his master replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;All right&hellip; but will Chu Feng be able to come as well?&rdquo; Zhang </span><span>Yingxiong</span><span> asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That day, right after they witnessed the phenomenon, his master quickly brought him to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, but everything was already over by the time they arrived. He wasn&rsquo;t able to meet Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be there,&rdquo; his master replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Master, does that mean that Brother Chu Feng is still alive?&rdquo; Zhang </span><span>Yingxiong</span><span> was overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no doubt about his master&rsquo;s words, especially since his master sounded confident that Chu Feng was still alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he respond to the invitation from Heaven Ranking then?&rdquo; Zhang </span><span>Yingxiong</span><span> asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His master simply revealed a deep smile, not answering the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Similarly, in outer space right outside the Bloodline Galaxy&rsquo;s Pulse Ignition Ordinary Realm, a man carrying an ax looked in the direction of the Ancestral Martial Galaxy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike others, he didn&rsquo;t look confused. He seemed to have noticed something&hellip;</span></p></div>
