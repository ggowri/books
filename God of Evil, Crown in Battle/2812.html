        <div> - There Can Never Be Too Much Deception In War<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>At that moment, the people of the younger generation present were all extremely frightened by the energy ripples, and had all hidden themselves behind the people of the older generation. While hiding behind their elders, they stealthily looked toward the battlefield. However, they were unable to see anything.<br>Only the experts from the older generation were able to see what was happening clearly. Under the attack from the enormous dragon, Chu Feng&rsquo;s Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword was trembling violently. It was as if it could collapse at any moment.<br>In fact, cracks visible to the naked eye were emerging on the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword and Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe.<br>Seeing this, not to mention Elder Ma Changchun, practically all of the elders from the Immortal Armament Villa and the Sacred Pellet Villa were prepared to interfere and save Chu Feng immediately should the situation turn bad.<br>Even though Chu Feng had already declared that he did not wish for them to interfere, they would not look on and allow Chu Feng to die.<br>They absolutely would not allow Chu Feng to be killed by Han Yu.<br>Fortunately, no matter how powerful that enormous dragon formed by Han Yu&rsquo;s Immortal Technique might be, its power was still limited. Soon, it stopped.<br>When the Immortal Technique dispersed, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe and Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword were already riddled with cracks.<br>That said, it remained that they had managed to withstand the enormous dragon.<br>Thus, Elder Ma Changchun and the others all heaved a sigh of relief.<br>&ldquo;Puu~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng opened his mouth and vomited several mouthfuls of blood in succession.<br>When Chu Feng stopped vomiting blood, his complexion turned paper-pale. His aura had grown extremely weak. Even standing became difficult for him.<br>&ldquo;Why is big brother Chu Feng insisting on continuing on with this?&rdquo;<br>Seeing Chu Feng looking like this, Li Xiang and the others revealed a pained expression.<br>As for the others present, there were those that felt admiration for Chu Feng, and also those that started to laugh at Chu Feng in their hearts.<br>Those that felt admiration for Chu Feng admired Chu Feng&rsquo;s zeal to not admit defeat.<br>Those that laughed at Chu Feng in their hearts felt that Chu Feng was simply no match for Han Yu, and could only forcibly defend against Han Yu&rsquo;s attacks with his two secret skills.<br>Yet, even if he managed to withstand the attacks, he was unable to unleash any counterattacks.<br>To continue to persist under such conditions was simply the behavior of a fool. That was the reason why they were laughing at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Puu~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Han Yu actually sprayed out a mouthful of blood. Then, he half knelt on the ground.<br>Looking at Han Yu, the crowd&rsquo;s expressions all changed.<br>They were shocked to discover that Han Yu&rsquo;s current complexion was not much better than Chu Feng&rsquo;s.<br>It was only at that moment that the crowd remembered that the backlash from Immortal Techniques was no small matter. Han Yu had unleashed two Immortal Techniques in succession. This would surely serve to put enormous pressure on him too.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a golden light suddenly soared into the sky.<br>Seeing the golden light, the crowd members present were all startled.<br>That golden light was actually Chu Feng&rsquo;s Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword. It had already left Chu Feng and, with overwhelming power, was moving toward Han Yu to attack him.<br>&ldquo;Damn it!!!&rdquo;<br>Seeing that the situation was bad, Han Yu hurriedly unleashed his Taboo Martial Skills at Chu Feng&rsquo;s Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword. He wanted to stop Chu Feng&rsquo;s attack.<br>Unfortunately, even though Han Yu unleashed many Taboo Martial Skills in succession, including even Ancestral Taboo Martial Skills, he was unable to stop Chu Feng&rsquo;s Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword at all.<br>At that moment, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword was simply unstoppable. All of the Taboo Martial Skills Han Yu shot forth to attack the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword were immediately shattered by it.<br>At the very most, those Taboo Martial Skills were able to slow down the speed of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword by a slight amount. Yet, they were unable to stop it completely.<br>Under such conditions, Chu Feng&rsquo;s Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword soon arrived before Han Yu.<br>&ldquo;Clank~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a loud sound was heard. The Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword was actually stopped.<br>Indeed, it was stopped. Han Yu had unleashed another Ancestral Taboo Martial Skill. It was an enormous shield. It was precisely that enormous shield that had stopped Chu Feng&rsquo;s Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword.<br>That said, even though Han Yu had managed to stop the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword, the crowd was currently looking at Han Yu with very complicated expressions.<br>Doubt filled their gazes. It was as if they did not dare to believe what they had just witnessed.<br>This was especially true for the people from Yuwen City. At that moment, they had furious and unreconciled expressions on their faces.<br>The reason for that was because there was actually a sword in Han Yu&rsquo;s hand. It was Han Yu&rsquo;s Incomplete Immortal Armament.<br>It turned out that Han Yu did not manage to stop the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword with only that shield-like Taboo Martial Skill. He had also utilized his Incomplete Immortal Armament to increase his battle power.<br>However, Han Yu had personally declared earlier that he would have lost this match should he use his Incomplete Immortal Armament.<br>That was the reason why the crowd was so astonished.<br>After all, Han Yu had lost.<br>&ldquo;Clank~~~&rdquo;<br>An ear-piercing sound was heard. It was the sound of Han Yu&rsquo;s Incomplete Immortal Armament falling to the ground.<br>Han Yu currently had an ashen expression on his face. Evidently, he also realized that he had utilized his Incomplete Immortal Armament and lost the match.<br>&ldquo;Han Yu, it&rsquo;s your loss.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s voice sounded.<br>Hearing that voice, Han Yu felt extremely unreconciled. However, even though this was the case, he still lifted his head to look toward Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you!!!&rdquo;<br>Once Han Yu saw Chu Feng, his expression changed enormously.<br>He was shocked to discover that Chu Feng not only had a rosy complexion, but his aura was also extremely abundant. He simply did not resemble the state of weakness and poor health he was in earlier.<br>Not only did Chu Feng completely recover, even his Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword and Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe had completely recovered. All the cracks had disappeared.<br>Those two heaven-defying secret skills were completely undamaged.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&hellip; you deceived me!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Han Yu let out a furious roar.<br>It was only at that moment that he realized that he had been deceived.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s earlier act of vomiting blood was all fake. That weak health of his was also fake. In fact, even the fact that his heaven-defying secret skills were trembling earlier was fake.<br>In fact, even the result from when Chu Feng used the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe to attack Han Yu the first time around was fake.<br>Chu Feng had deliberately made Han Yu believe that he was no match for him, that he could only be beaten. By doing so, Chu Feng would be able to lower Han Yu&rsquo;s guard and unleash a counterattack.<br>It was too dangerous earlier. Han Yu didn&rsquo;t have enough time to use an Immortal Technique. However, he was unable to stop Chu Feng&rsquo;s Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword using only Ancestral Taboo Martial Skills.<br>In imminent peril, he subconsciously used his Incomplete Immortal Armament.<br>However, he had forgotten that he would lose should he use his Incomplete Immortal Armament.<br>&ldquo;This Chu Feng, all of it was actually a disguise. So&hellip; it wasn&rsquo;t that he was no match for Han Yu.&rdquo;<br>The others present also realized the truth at the same time Han Yu did.<br>When the truth was revealed, both the people from the older generation and those from the younger generation were all astonished.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng&rsquo;s disguise had simply been too real. Even they were unable to tell that he was putting on a disguise. In fact, they were even thinking that Chu Feng would not be a match for Han Yu.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you despicable bastard, you were fighting with an unfair advantage!!!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Han Yu let out a shout. Unreconciliation filled his face. In fact, deep disdain was being emitted from his eyes.<br>Evidently, he was unable to accept his defeat.<br>Faced with such a Han Yu, Chu Feng smiled lightly. He said, &ldquo;Han Yu, have you heard of &lsquo;there can never be too much deception in war?&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I, Chu Feng, was merely pretending to be weak. It&rsquo;s not like I poisoned you or something. As such, how am I despicable?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, it was you who declared that it would be your loss should you use your Incomplete Immortal Armament. It&rsquo;s not like it was a condition that was forced upon you by me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you want to blame someone, you can only blame yourself.&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng said those words, many of the people present started to nod their heads to express their approval.<br>None of them felt what Chu Feng did to be despicable. On the contrary, they felt Chu Feng to be brilliant. This was especially true for the people of the younger generations; they were feeling great admiration for Chu Feng.<br>They thought to themselves that, if it were them, they would definitely not be able to think of such a strategy. Of course, they simply did not possess the ability to use such a strategy either.<br>After all, it was not an easy task to put forth such a perfect disguise.<br>As for Chu Feng, not only had he deceived Han Yu, he had even deceived everyone present.<br><br><br></p></div>
