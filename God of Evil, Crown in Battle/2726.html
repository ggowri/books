        <h1>Chapter 2725</h1>
        <div> - Truly A Demon-level Genius<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Like an actual ferocious beast, the Immortal Technique Heavenly Lion Fist charged forth aggressively with its mouth wide open, roaring nonstop. It seemed to want to devour the entire sky.<br>As for the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe, although it did not let out any roar, its imposing might was not at all inferior to the giant lion&rsquo;s. It was as if it would sever anything that blocked its path.<br>Finally, the two of them grew close to one another. However, before they could collide with one another, their auras began to clash in the sky.<br>Energy ripples began to surge about. They began to spread about magnificently, like fireworks. However, those energy ripples were so ferocious that it seemed as if they could destroy everything.<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>A loud sound was heard. Then, heaven and earth started to tremble. Many of the younger generations present all fell on their butts due to the intense trembling.<br>It was that Immortal Technique and Chu Feng&rsquo;s Secret Skill. They had collided.<br>As the two of them had actually collided, the energy ripples that they emitted grew even more vigorous. Furthermore, the surging energy ripples became even more powerful.<br>Fortunately, there were many experts present. Thus, they were capable of blocking the energy ripples with their oppressive might.<br>Else, if the energy ripples were to land, then all of the younger generations present would likely end up being killed by the energy ripples. Not even their bones would remain.<br>However, the people present had no heart to care about how intense the energy ripples were.<br>Everyone was focused on the Immortal Technique and Secret Skill that were fighting one another.<br>After all, this was the crucial moment that would determine the outcome of the battle.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the gazes of the experts present all changed.<br>The reason for that was because the Immortal Technique had started to disperse. As the Immortal Technique dispersed, the energy ripples also started to dissipate.<br>At that moment, everyone present, regardless of whether or not they were experts, were able to see the situation in the sky.<br>Chu Xianshuo&rsquo;s Immortal Technique Heavenly Lion Fist had dispersed. However, Chu Feng&rsquo;s Secret Skill Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe was still standing horizontally in the sky.<br>It was still emitting an imposing and extraordinary air. It was still extremely majestic, like a ruler of all weapons looking down on everything.<br>No, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe appeared to be even more imposing. It appeared to be shining even brighter.<br>It was as if it were informing everyone that it was the victor of this confrontation.<br>&ldquo;No, this is impossible!&rdquo;<br>Chu Xianshuo did not dare to believe his eyes. He began to shout hysterically.<br>&ldquo;Puu~~~&rdquo;<br>Soon, he opened his mouth and sprayed out a mouthful of blood. Following that, his knees grew weak, and he half-kneeled in midair.<br>At that moment, his complexion turned paper pale. His appearance was like that of a dead person whilst his aura had grown extremely weak.<br>It would appear that while he had successfully unleashed the Immortal Technique Heavenly Lion Fist, the Immortal Technique had burdened his body enormously.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe suddenly started to move. With boundless oppressive might, it moved to attack Chu Xianshuo.<br>Chu Xianshuo was truly too weak at that moment. Before the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe even reached him, the oppressive might it emitted made Chu Xianshuo lose the ability to fly. Like a kite with cut strings, he started to fall from the sky.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Xianshuo!&rdquo;<br>Seeing this scene, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations all soared into the sky. They wanted to catch the falling Chu Xianshuo.<br>However, after they approached Chu Xianshuo, they too were enveloped by the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe&rsquo;s oppressive might.<br>Immediately, they started to scream out loud. None of them were able to withstand the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe&rsquo;s oppressive might. Together with Chu Xianshuo, they all fell from the sky.<br>In the end, all of them smashed into the ground.<br>The impact of their crash was so strong that their bodies actually left massive craters behind in the ground.<br>However, this was the result of Chu Feng holding back. Otherwise, with the might of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe, likely, with the exception of Chu Xianshuo, all of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations would&rsquo;ve been killed.<br>That said, while they were alive, they were forced into the ground like dying dogs, unable to move in the slightest.<br>Furthermore, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe did not stop. It was still descending toward them.<br>Seeing the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe that was closing in on them, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations all revealed fear on their faces.<br>They felt the aura of death from the incoming Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe.<br>They were truly afraid that Chu Feng would end up killing them.<br>As matters stood, they had discovered that Chu Feng was simply a maverick. He was someone who dared to do anything.<br>Naturally, he would also dare to kill them.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what are you planning to do?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Stop! If you dare kill us, our Chu Heavenly Clan will definitely not spare you!&rdquo;<br>Chu Xianshuo was unable to help himself, and began to shout hysterically. Even though he had tried his best to make his voice appear grand and imposing, the trembling in his voice still exposed the fear in his heart.<br>Chu Feng completely ignored Chu Xianshuo. The Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe was still bearing down upon them without slowing down in the slightest.<br>Although the speed at which the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe was descending was not very fast to begin with, it would, sooner or later, land on Chu Xianshuo and the others should it continue to descend.<br>&ldquo;That Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t possibly really be planning to kill the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s young masters and young ladies, right?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the surrounding crowd was also sweating cold bullets. After all, no matter what sort of background Chu Feng might have, killing the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm would be a capital offense.<br>&ldquo;Lord Villa Master.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the fiery red-haired old man also started to panic. Unable to contain himself, he looked to the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master.<br>While they were not afraid if Chu Feng were to be killed by Chu Xianshuo, their Immortal Armament Villa would definitely have to shoulder responsibility should they ignore the matter and allow Chu Xianshuo and the other Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations to be killed by Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t panic, I&rsquo;ve got this,&rdquo; the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master said.<br>Compared to the fiery red-haired old man, that Lord Villa Master was still completely calm and composed. It was as if he was still in control of everything.<br>Hearing those words, the fiery red-haired old man finally felt relieved.<br>With the strength that the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master possessed, if he wanted to save Chu Xianshuo and the others, Chu Feng would definitely not be able to kill them.<br>However, Chu Xianshuo and the others had no idea what the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master planned to do. They were only seeing the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe and feeling that fatal aura growing closer and closer upon them. At that moment, many of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations were completely scared witless.<br>Even Chu Xianshuo was unable to contain his fear anymore.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost. I, Chu Xianshuo, have lost.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve admitted my defeat, alright?! Stop, stop!&rdquo; Chu Xianshuo shouted.<br>He had actually admitted defeat.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>After he said those words, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe finally stopped descending.<br>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be easier if you had just admitted defeat sooner?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng smiled lightly. The next moment, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe and the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword on his body both started to fade away. The Lightning Mark on Chu Feng&rsquo;s forehead also began to fade away.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s aura once again returned to that of a rank two True Immortal. His actions had revealed that he planned to stop.<br>Seeing this scene, many of the people present heaved a sigh of relief. This was especially true for the people of the Immortal Armament Villa.<br>If the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations were to truly die in the Immortal Armament Villa, it would most definitely not be good for them.<br>Chu Xianshuo stood up and stared at Chu Feng with a gaze filled with bitter hatred and resentment. He continued to stare at Chu Feng for a very long time.<br>Finally, he said, &ldquo;Chu Feng, it is true that I, Chu Xianshuo, have been defeated today. However, the future is long. Just you wait.&rdquo;<br>After leaving those words fiercely, Chu Xianshuo brought the other Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations and left.<br>They left extremely fast. They did not even bother to look back. In the blink of an eye, they disappeared into the distance.<br>That was understandable too. After all, they had been truly humiliated today.<br>As a genius of the Chu Heavenly Clan, not only did Chu Xianshuo lose to Chu Feng in terms of world spirit techniques, he even lost to Chu Feng, a rank two True Immortal, in a confrontation with martial power even though he was a rank four True Immortal.<br>This was truly inexcusable.<br>&ldquo;Puu~~~&rdquo;<br>Right after Chu Xianshuo and the other Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations left, Chu Feng sprayed out a mouthful of blood.<br>Then, his face also turned pale.<br>Although Chu Feng did not become as weak as Chu Xianshuo, he still looked as if he had been seriously injured.<br>&ldquo;This is?&rdquo;<br>The crowd were all astonished to see Chu Feng like this. When the two of them were fighting earlier, Chu Feng seemed to have been dominant the entire time. Furthermore, he was never once struck by Chu Xianshuo. Thus, he shouldn&rsquo;t have been injured.<br>Seeing Chu Feng like this, the crowd was momentarily confused.<br>Right at that moment, the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master said, &ldquo;It would appear that using those secret skills poses a great risk to little friend Chu Feng too.&rdquo;<br>After he said those words, the crowd realized why Chu Feng suddenly became like that.<br>It turned out that it was a backlash from using such powerful secret skills simultaneously.<br>However, upon thinking about it, this sort of backlash was very reasonable. After all, ordinary people would simply not be able to manage secret skills that powerful.<br>It was already an extremely astonishing feat for Chu Feng to use such powerful secret skills simultaneously.<br>Thus, the crowd did not look down on Chu Feng just because he had received a backlash from the secret skills. Instead, they felt him to be extremely amazing.<br>No matter what, Chu Feng had still defeated Chu Xianshuo, a rank four True Immortal, with the cultivation of a rank two True Immortal.<br>Moreover, Chu Xianshuo was not an ordinary rank four True Immortal. He was also a renowned genius.<br>Because of that, an identical opinion formed in the hearts of the crowd.<br>That is&hellip; Chu Feng was a demon-level genius.<br><br><br></p></div>
