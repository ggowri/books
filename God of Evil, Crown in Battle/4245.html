        <h1>Chapter 4244</h1>
        <div> - On The Dragon Disclosure Stone<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Old Man Compliance flicked his wrist, and a cyan stone appeared in his hand.<br>He raised his arm, and the cyan stone immediately began expanding in size.<br>At the beginning, it was only the size of a stone. But in the blink of an eye, it had transformed into a giant object that was over tens of thousands of meters long.<br>It floated in midair, and covered the entire sky.<br>That was the Dragon Disclosure Stone, a treasure that could reveal a martial cultivator&rsquo;s Dragon Transformation Sensation.<br>At that moment, all the martial cultivators present immediately soared into the sky and onto the stone. They all wanted to get a good viewing spot for the upcoming showdown between geniuses.<br>Old Man Compliance, Chu Feng and Lu Jie also flew onto the Dragon Disclosure Stone.<br>Chu Feng was the first to land on it.<br>&ldquo;Buzz---&rdquo;<br>Once Chu Feng landed, a semitransparent body of light shone from beneath Chu Feng&rsquo;s feet.<br>The body of light had been sent out by the Dragon Disclosure Stone, and had enveloped Chu Feng.<br>A veined pattern appeared on the body of light. It was a pattern resembling a dragon. That dragon began drifting around Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation.&rdquo;<br>Seeing the pattern that had appeared on the body of light, the crowd were not too surprised.<br>If it were another person of the younger generation within a hundred years of age, they might be surprised by this.<br>But, Chu Feng was no ordinary person of the younger generation. He was also the genius that had managed to stand firm on the Talent Steps&rsquo; third step.<br>With his talent, people felt that it was only natural that he had reached rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation as a person of the younger generation within a hundred years of age.<br>Instead, if Chu Feng hadn&rsquo;t reached rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation, they would think that he had failed to live up to his talent.<br>&ldquo;Woosh---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, another figure descended from midair and landed on the Dragon Disclosure Stone.<br>It was Lu Jie!<br>Once Lu Jie landed, a body of light identical to the one that had enveloped Chu Feng appeared from beneath his feet.<br>The body of light soon formed a pattern identical to the one on Chu Feng&rsquo;s body of light.<br>The pattern resembled a dragon but wasn&rsquo;t a dragon. It was emitting a special sort of aura as if it were alive.<br>Soon, a second dragon-like pattern appeared.<br>Following that, a third dragon-like pattern appeared.<br>&ldquo;Rank three Dragon Transformation Sensation?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lu Jie has actually grasped rank three Dragon Transformation Sensation?!&rdquo;<br>Seeing the three dragon-like patterns that had appeared around Lu Jie, the crowd burst into a complete uproar.<br>Even Chu Feng revealed a look of surprise.<br>According to the rumors, Lu Jie should&rsquo;ve only comprehended rank two Dragon Transformation Sensation.<br>But, it would appear that rumors were merely rumors. When Lu Jie landed on the Dragon Disclosure Stone, his true strength had been revealed.<br>Lu Jie had comprehended rank three Dragon Transformation Sensation.<br>Rank three Dragon Transformation Sensation would give one battle power comparable to a rank six Utmost Exalted.<br>It was a level of strength that the current Chu Feng could not contend against.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid. I will suppress my power. I will not use my real strength to handle you.&rdquo;<br>Lu Jie looked at Chu Feng with a mocking gaze.<br>Earlier, he had been greatly infuriated after being insulted by Chu Feng. Now, he was finally able to turn things around.<br>So what if his talent was inferior to Chu Feng&rsquo;s? His strength far surpassed Chu Feng's.<br>At least, that was the case now. But, that would suffice.<br>After all, cultivators were people that lived in the present.<br>The reason for that was because many exceptionally talented people would be killed and never have the chance to realize their future potential.<br>&ldquo;Use these Dragon Restriction Bracelets,&rdquo; Old Man Compliance said all of a sudden.<br>As he spoke, he raised his hand, and two bracelets flew towards Lu Jie.<br>Those bracelets seemed to be made out of stone. Both their aura and their construction greatly resembled the Dragon Disclosure Stone. Yet, they were different from the Dragon Disclosure Stone.<br>&ldquo;Never would I have expected Old Man Compliance to care about Chu Feng this much.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that Chu Feng is your disciple?&rdquo;<br>Lu Jie did not immediately place the Dragon Restriction Bracelets on his wrists. Instead, he raised his head to look to Old Man Compliance.<br>Once he said those words, the crowd immediately began to wonder.<br>Old Man Compliance was not only the master of the Ancient Compliance Castle, his strength was also very powerful.<br>But, never had they heard of him having any disciples.<br>Yet, Chu Feng had not only discovered the Hidden Gate, but had also ascended the Talent Steps.<br>Furthermore, Old Man Compliance was very concerned about the match between Chu Feng and Lu Jie.<br>Judging from this, it might be truly possible that they already knew one another.<br>Perhaps Lu Jie&rsquo;s guess was correct.<br>Perhaps Chu Feng was really Old Man Compliance&rsquo;s disciple.<br>Suddenly, a voice sounded. Then, Grandmaster Tang Chen appeared. &ldquo;This old man can testify that Chu Feng does not have any relationship with Old Man Compliance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Tang Chen?&rdquo;<br>The crowd&rsquo;s expressions changed upon seeing Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen was one of the most renowned world spiritists in the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>Furthermore, the people all felt that Grandmaster Tang Chen would comprehend rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation sooner or later.<br>Although there were a great number of grandmaster world spiritists, Grandmaster Tang Chen was one of the most renowned.<br>Nevertheless, someone still voiced the question. &ldquo;Grandmaster Tang Chen, how can you determine that this Chu Feng is not Old Man Compliance&rsquo;s disciple?&rdquo;<br>Whilst Grandmaster Tang Chen possessed both strength and prestige, he still had to show proof to testify for Chu Feng. Else, it would be a baseless claim, and difficult for people to believe.<br>&ldquo;This old man knows Chu Feng&rsquo;s master.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, I am unable to reveal who he is.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, you all will one day learn who he is,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;Tang Chen knows him?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Who could it possibly be?&rdquo;<br>The crowd grew even more curious after hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;Lu Jie, don&rsquo;t bother wasting this old man&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t dare to put on the bracelets, you can withdraw right now,&rdquo; said Old Man Compliance. There was a trace of annoyance in his voice.<br>His reaction was understandable.<br>Earlier, Lu Jie had deliberately instigated the crowd and had made them think that Chu Feng had some sort of relationship with Old Man Compliance.<br>His intention was clear; he was trying to criticize Old Man Compliance for discriminating in favor of Chu Feng.<br>However, Old Man Compliance clearly didn&rsquo;t discriminate in favor of anyone. He was merely trying to uphold fairness. That was the entire reason why he had proposed the Dragon Disclosure Stone and Dragon Restriction Bracelets.<br>&ldquo;Humph.&rdquo;<br>Lu Jie snorted. Then, he placed the two bracelets onto his wrists.<br>After putting on the bracelets, the body of light that had enveloped Lu Jie only displayed a single dragon-like pattern. The other two dragon-like patterns had both undergone changes.<br>They had turned transparent. Their extraordinary aura had also disappeared.<br>The crowd was not surprised by this.<br>That was the power of the Dragon Restriction Bracelets. Standing on the Dragon Disclosure Stone with the Dragon Restriction Bracelets on, Liu Jie&rsquo;s world spirit techniques would be restricted.<br>At that moment, Lu Jie had two ranks of Dragon Transformation Sensation restricted by the bracelets. He now only possessed the power of rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation.<br>Unless he left the Dragon Disclosure Stone or removed the Dragon Restriction Bracelets, he would not be able to utilize his other two levels of Dragon Transformation Sensation.<br>&ldquo;Is it fair now?&rdquo;<br>Lu Jie looked at Chu Feng. There was a mocking smile on his face.<br>Facing Lu Jie&rsquo;s provocation, Chu Feng also smiled. He said, &ldquo;Have you prepared yourself for defeat?&rdquo;<br></p></div>
