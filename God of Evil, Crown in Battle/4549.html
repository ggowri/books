        <h1>Chapter 4548</h1>
        <div>: I&rsquo;ll Make a Choice on Your Behalf<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While Gu Mingyuan, Chu Lingxi, and the crowd from the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan were astonished by Chu Feng&rsquo;s relationship with the four behemoths, Lu Wantong and the others were completely horrified.<br>They would have never thought that Chu Feng would have such a frightening background too.<br>How could a person possibly be so well-connected as to have the four behemoths stand up for him at the same time?<br>One must know that other than the Holy Light Clan, there should have been no one else who had the influence to move all of these four behemoths simultaneously!<br>This was no junior from a trashy Starfield that they were dealing with here; he was actually the demon himself!<br>&ldquo;Gu Yang, didn&rsquo;t you say that he comes from the lowly Chu Heavenly Clan and has no background whatsoever to speak of?&rdquo;<br>Lu Wantong looked at Gu Yang with eyes so sharp that it looked as if he wanted to tear the latter into shreds. Had it not been for Gu Yang&rsquo;s words, he would have never landed in such an awkward position!<br>&ldquo;I-I-I&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Gu Yang also didn&rsquo;t expect things to turn out like this either. He was so frightened that his words became incoherent.<br>How was he to know that Chu Feng would have such a frightening background? There was no way he would have dared to think of dethroning the Chu Heavenly Clan had he known this!<br>&ldquo;A mere Chu Heavenly Clan? Is that how you describe the clan which young friend Chu Feng comes from? Lu Wantong, it looks like arrogance has really gotten to your head! You&rsquo;re courting your own death!&rdquo;<br>The Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster seemed to be acquainted with Lu Wantong, but his attitude toward the latter was incredibly hostile at this moment.<br>In fact, it wasn&rsquo;t just him. The Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, and even the seemingly gentle Cloudsky Immortal Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster were looking at Lu Wantong and his group coldly.<br>&ldquo;Milords, please listen to my explanation. I was deceived by Gu Yang. I carry no ill will toward Lord Chu Feng. It&rsquo;s all the doing of this Gu Yang!&rdquo;<br>Lu Wantong unhesitatingly tossed the blame over to Gu Yang.<br>&ldquo;You issued an ultimatum to my little sister Chu Lingxi, saying that she had to marry you or else you would obliterate the entire Ten Thousand Province Ancient Clan. Are you going to blame that on Gu Yang too?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a misunderstanding! You can&rsquo;t just listen to one side of the story! Gu Yang told me that Miss Chu Lingxi is interested in me, which is why I came here to pay her visit. Yet, when I came here, she rejected me publicly, putting me in an awkward position. It&rsquo;s under such circumstances that I made such a declaration. I just wanted to scare them; I had no intention of hurting them at all!&rdquo;<br>Lu Wantong was still trying his best to wriggle his way out of this crisis.<br>But in truth, everyone present knew just what kind of person Lu Wantong was. He had simply committed too many evil deeds in the past.<br>As such, the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster and the others weren&rsquo;t interested in hearing his explanation at all. Instead, they turned to look at Chu Feng to seek his verdict.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, how do wish for this Lu Wantong to be dealt with?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t leave such black sheeps to continue bringing harm to the others and smear the reputation of the Holy Light Galaxy. In my opinion, a person like Lu Wantong&hellip; deserves not to exist on the face of the world! Elders, what do you say?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Shoosh&mdash;<br>And right after Chu Feng said those words aloud, the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster thrust his palm outward.<br>With a dull thud, Lu Wantong&rsquo;s body was torn to shreds, causing blood to spew all over the air.<br>The Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster didn&rsquo;t even bother saying anything at all. He went right in and claimed Lu Wantong&rsquo;s life.<br>This blood-curdling sight left all of Lu Wantong&rsquo;s allies horrified. It was so frightening that they felt like their souls were going to dissipate from sheer fear.<br>&ldquo;Milord, please spare us! We were all fooled by Lu Wantong! We were all oblivious to the truth!&rdquo;<br>The crowd quickly kneeled to the floor and pleaded for mercy. Otherwise, these powerhouses could very well have them killed in the next instant out of a whim!<br>This was really no joking matter here.<br>If things were to blow up, not only would they lose their lives, but even the powers behind them could be utterly destroyed too.<br>They were filled with regrets over their folly. If only they knew that the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan had the backing of the little monster known as Chu Feng, they would have never gotten involved in this matter.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all people with high standings in your respective Starfields. Are you trying to tell me that you don&rsquo;t have the ability to discern right from wrong?&rdquo; the Clodusky Immortal Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster asked coldly.<br>&ldquo;We have done wrong! We really know our mistakes now! Milord, please spare our lives! It&rsquo;s a moment of folly that we ended up siding with Lu Wantong! We&rsquo;ll never do it again!&rdquo;<br>The crowd continued pleading for mercy. There was nothing else they could do given the current situation.<br>&ldquo;Whether you&rsquo;ll live or not, that&rsquo;s not our call to make. It&rsquo;s young friend Chu Feng&rsquo;s words that count!&rdquo; the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster said as he turned to look at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, tell us how you wish to deal with them. We&rsquo;ll make sure that this matter is wrapped up to your satisfaction,&rdquo; the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Lord Chu Feng, we&rsquo;re victims of Lu Wantong&rsquo;s deception too! We didn&rsquo;t know better either! It&rsquo;s unfair to fault the ignorant. Even though we have come here with him today, we had no intention whatsoever to harm anyone from the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan at all. So, please give us a chance to make amendments!&rdquo;<br>The leaders of Lu Wantong&rsquo;s allied powers tried their best to justify their actions and plead with Chu Feng for mercy.<br>&ldquo;Elders, I&rsquo;m not too experienced with this kind of matter, so I&rsquo;ll have to ask you to make a judgment on my behalf. However, I&rsquo;d just like to say that Chu Lingxi is not just a member of theChu Heavenly Clan, she&rsquo;s also my blood-related little sister too. Elder Gu Mingyuan is also my benefactor too,&rdquo; Chu Feng told the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the others.<br>While he didn&rsquo;t give a clear response as to how he wanted these powers to be punished, he had clearly expressed his intention that he couldn&rsquo;t allow this matter to rest easily.<br>While these powers were no match for the four behemoths, they were still the dominant power in their respective Middle Starfields. If they were to kill all of them here, the balance of power of the Holy Light Galaxy would be shaken, and that could very well incur the displeasure of the Holy Light Clan.<br>Had it been under normal circumstances, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the others would have probably let them off with a stern warning. After all, this wasn&rsquo;t exactly a major issue. However, since Chu Feng was involved in this matter, they were obliged to give him a satisfactory answer.<br>&ldquo;What are you all waiting for? If you don&rsquo;t want to die, kneel down and apologize to the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan. Show your sincerity in making compensations. If any of us were to find your sincerity lacking, you need not dream of walking out of here alive!&rdquo; the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, Lord Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief! Thank you, Lord Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>There was no way the crowd would dare to hesitate in this situation. They quickly thanked Chu Feng before formally apologizing to the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan. Then, they took out all of their treasures and presented them to the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan as compensation for what they did.<br>Even when those treasures were placed right into the hands of the clan members of the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan, they still couldn&rsquo;t bring themselves to believe that this was really all happening at the moment.<br>Any single one of the treasures they had just received was easily worth more than the full fortune of the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan.<br>In truth, Chu Feng understood the difficulties faced by the Dragon Clan and the others too. Even with the great power they possessed, they couldn&rsquo;t just obliterate multiple dominant powers of Middle Starfields so easily. Furthermore, they were just accomplices in this matter.<br>So, he was still satisfied with how the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief wrapped things up.<br>After these powers compensated the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan, they immediately fled from this land. They wouldn&rsquo;t want to stay here for even a moment longer, or else they might just shrivel up from all of the stress.<br>However, there was one person who couldn&rsquo;t escape, and he was no other than Gu Yang.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, since Gu Yang is a member of our Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan, I&rsquo;ll leave it to you to decide on how you wish to deal with him,&rdquo; the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>This was an opinion shared by the other three powerhouses too.<br>&ldquo;Lord Chu Feng, please spare me! Please spare me!<br>&ldquo;I have no intention of harming Lingxi. I&rsquo;m doing this with the welfare of the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan at heart. It&rsquo;s only out of a moment of folly that I did something so foolish!&rdquo;<br>Gu Yang was crying so much that it felt like he was going to melt into tears. He kneeled before Chu Feng as he kowtowed his head again and again on the ground.<br>&ldquo;You said that you had no intention of harming Lingxi? The cheek of you to say such words!&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered coldly and he took step after step toward Gu Yang.<br>Every step Chu Feng came closer to him, Gu Yang&rsquo;s heart would tremor in fear. He felt as if the gates of hell were slowly approaching him.<br>&ldquo;Mingyuan, save me, please! I don&rsquo;t want to die! I know my mistakes now, really! I&rsquo;ll devote my life to making amendments toward you and Lingxi, so please!&rdquo;<br>Knowing that Chu Feng had no intention of letting him off, Gu Yang could only turn to Gu Mingyuan for help.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, forget it. Despite what Gu Yang did, he&rsquo;s still a member of our Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan. I&rsquo;ll discuss his punishment with the other elders in the clan.&rdquo;<br>In the end, Gu Mingyuan was still unable to harden her heart against Gu Yang.<br>However, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t pay any heed to Gu Mingyuan. Instead, he turned to Chu Lingxi and asked, &ldquo;Little sister Lingxi, tell me. How do you think I should deal with Gu Yang?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Lingxi was put into a position of dilemma. She shot a glance at her mother, and for a very long while, she was unable to make up her mind.<br>It went without saying that she couldn&rsquo;t bring herself to forgive Gu Yang after what he had done. It was her entire life that he was ruining here! But at the same time, she knew that her mother treasured her bonds with Gu Yang, or else her mother would have never spoken up on Gu Yang&rsquo;s behalf.<br>As a result, Chu Lingxi was put in a difficult position.<br>Shoosh&mdash;<br>It was at this instant that Chu Feng suddenly released a punch toward Gu Yang&rsquo;s face. The sheer force reduced his flesh and bones into a puddle of thick crimson fluid, ending his life thoroughly.<br>&ldquo;You need not say anything anymore, little sister Lingxi. I&rsquo;ve already decided for you,&rdquo; Chu Feng turned to Chu Lingxi and said.<br></p></div>
