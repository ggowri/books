        <h1>Chapter 3270</h1>
        <div> - Face Covered With Fear<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Chu Feng turned his gaze to the Heaven-reaching Beast Clan and the Nightmare Spirit Clan.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze was extremely calm. However, in the eyes of the Heaven-reaching Beast Clansmen and the Nightmare Spirit Clansmen, those eyes did not appear to be calm at all.<br>After feeling Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze, they immediately felt their heart tensing up. The Heaven-reaching Beast Clansmen, even with their enormous bodies, were actually trembling.<br>They were shivering in fear. They were afraid. They were afraid of Chu Feng from the bottom of their hearts.<br>Their reactions were only natural. When even the Linghu Heavenly Clan had been driven out of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm by Chu Feng, how could they possibly not be afraid of him?<br>&ldquo;Young Hero Chu Feng, we were forced by the Linghu Heavenly Clan. We did not truly intend to become your enemy. Please be the bigger man and spare us.&rdquo;<br>With the situation being as you was, the people from the Nightmare Spirit Clan were so scared that they immediately bowed respectfully to Chu Feng and publicly begged him for forgiveness.<br>&ldquo;Young Hero Chu Feng, you are a person who is able to distinguish between right and wrong. You should know that we were all forced to do what we&rsquo;d done.&rdquo;<br>Immediately afterward, the Heaven-reaching Monstrous Clansmen also bowed respectfully to Chu Feng.<br>Witnessing that scene, the crowd all gasped.<br>After all, both the Nightmare Spirit Clan and the Heaven-reaching Monstrous Clan were very strong powers in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.<br>Whilst it was true that the crowd had gasped upon seeing the scene, they were not too surprised by it.<br>As matters stood, who would dare to refuse to submit to Chu Feng?<br>&ldquo;Young Hero Chu Feng, from today on, the brothers of our clan inside this Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm are willing to listen to your every order.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The brothers of our clan are also willing to listen to Young Hero Chu Feng&rsquo;s orders.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young Hero Chu Feng, please instruct us. With a word from you, we would be willing to climb mountains of blades and walk through a sea of flames without any hesitation.&rdquo;<br>Immediately after that, apart from the Li Heavenly Clan and the Dongguo Heavenly Clan, the various powers gathered there actually all began to voice their desire to follow Chu Feng.<br>The ones feeling the most joyous upon seeing that scene were none other than the Chu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>The reason for that was because those enormously powerful existences that they feared were not only voicing their desire to serve Chu Feng, but they were even looking at them with reverence-filled eyes.<br>Ever since they had left the Chu Heavenly Clan and arrived in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen had always been the target of bullying, humiliation and contempt by the others in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. They had already forgotten the feeling of being looked up to and respected by others.<br>However, they&rsquo;d managed to regain all of that. Furthermore, they had not gained it from the powers within the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. Instead, they&rsquo;d gained their respect from clans that were even more powerful than their Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>At that moment, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were all unable to keep themselves from looking over to Chu Feng.<br>Gratitude filled their eyes.<br>Had it not been for Chu Feng, they would not have what they had at that moment.<br>Only they knew the feelings they had at that moment.<br>Overwhelmed by emotions, there were actually Chu Heavenly Clansmen that started to shed silent tears.<br>However, in terms of feeling emotional, the one that was feeling the most emotional would be none other than Chu Ping.<br>Chu Ping had always been cautious in his every action. He was the one who had advocated for forbearance because he was afraid of creating troubles for their Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>However, after personally witnessing how Chu Feng, by himself and through his enormous power, drove out the Linghu Heavenly Clan and made all the various powers present voice their desire to serve their Chu Heavenly Clan, Chu Ping suddenly realized that his way of thinking in the past was a mistake, and Chu Feng&rsquo;s notion was the correct one.<br>Chu Ping had realized that this world of martial cultivators was truly one where might was right.<br>Even if you were to exercise forbearance against bullying and humiliation, no one would feel pity for you. Instead, they would see you as despicable, and hold you in contempt. In fact, they would even join in on the bullying and humiliation against you.<br>However, should you become powerful, even if you were rude and unreasonable, even if you were completely tyrannical and overbearing, people would still fear you and respect you. Even the people around you would be able to obtain the same sort of respect.<br>That said, whilst the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were all basking in ecstatic joy, Chu Feng did not express much excitement.<br>The reason for that was because he knew that what he had done would have completely antagonized the Linghu Heavenly Clan.<br>However, he did not regret his decision. If one did not have the courage to challenge the mighty, one would forever be trampled under their feet, and be unable to free oneself in one&rsquo;s entire life.<br>&hellip;...<br>Meanwhile, outside the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. In the Linghu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s capital city. A great disturbance arose.<br>Linghu Tiemian and the other Linghu Heavenly Clansmen had all returned to the Linghu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s capital city at practically the same time. Furthermore, their complexions were very pale. It was as if they were seriously injured.<br>Seeing this, the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen realized that their clan&rsquo;s younger generations must&rsquo;ve encountered something in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.<br>At that moment, Linghu Tiemian and the others&rsquo; injuries were all completely healed. Furthermore, they were all brought to the same palace hall.<br>There were several elderly individuals standing inside the palace. Each and every one of them emitted the airs of an immortal, and were extremely imposing.<br>Those elderly individuals resembled immortals that had descended upon the world of mortals. From a glance, one could tell that they were extraordinary people.<br>That being said, those elderly individuals all had stern expressions on their faces at that moment.<br>The status that the Linghu Heavenly Clan enjoyed in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm was known to everyone. No one dared to disrespect them.<br>As for their Linghu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations, they had been living up to their expectations. In the past few hundred years, they had continued to dominate the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm as its ruler.<br>However, the present situation was that their Linghu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations inside the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm were actually all driven out.<br>This was not only a failure of these Linghu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations, it also meant that someone was challenging their Linghu Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;Tiemian, exactly what happened?&rdquo; An elderly man among the group of elders asked.<br>&ldquo;Milord, Mingye&hellip; has he returned?&rdquo; Linghu Tiemian did not answer the question, and instead asked a question of his own.<br>He was extremely worried for Linghu Mingye. Even though he knew that he should still be alive, and should&rsquo;ve returned to the Linghu Heavenly Clan, he was still unable to keep himself from wanting to verify it.<br>&ldquo;Mingye has returned. His psychological condition was extremely poor when he returned. Likely, he suffered some inhumane torture.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, no matter how we tried to ask him what had happened, he refused to say a word. It seemed as if he was unwilling to speak of what happened to him,&rdquo; an elderly man said.<br>&ldquo;Damn it,&rdquo; hearing those words, Linghu Tiemian clenched his fists tightly. He knew that the reason for Linghu Mingye&rsquo;s reaction must&rsquo;ve been because he had suffered from Chu Feng&rsquo;s torture.<br>&ldquo;Tiemian, tell us, exactly who did this? Did the same individual drive all of you out of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm?&rdquo; The Linghu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s elder asked.<br>&ldquo;Yes, it was all done by the same person,&rdquo; Linghu Tiemian answered.<br>Hearing those words, the facial expressions of the elders did not change. However, their gazes changed slightly.<br>A single person actually managed to drive out all of their Linghu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s geniuses in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.<br>From this, it could be seen that the person who did it was not a simple character.<br>&ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo; The elders asked in unison.<br>&ldquo;Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; Linghu Tiemian answered.<br>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo;<br>Hearing that answer, the expressions of those elders who enjoyed great status and position changed enormously.<br></p></div>
