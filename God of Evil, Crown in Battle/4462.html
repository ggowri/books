        <div>: Wronged<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;It looks like it isn&rsquo;t that easy to earn the true acknowledgment of this weapon,&rdquo; Chu Feng remarked as he looked at the Immemorial Hero&rsquo;s Sword in his hands.<br>He had to make a lot of difficult choices and go through many tribulations and trials before he was finally able to walk into this hall. It hadn&rsquo;t been an easy journey for him at all.<br>At the very least, of the many people who had entered the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Tomb of Armaments, he had been the only one who managed to get this far.<br>But despite having successfully obtained the Immemorial Hero&rsquo;s Sword, he realized that its powers weren&rsquo;t his to use yet.<br>He immediately understood that he would still have to undergo some other trial if he wanted to tap into the strength of the Immemorial Hero&rsquo;s Sword.<br>However, what that left Chu Feng feeling deeply frustrated was that he didn&rsquo;t even know what this trial was. He didn&rsquo;t know what he had to do in order to be able to use the power of the Immemorial Hero&rsquo;s Sword.<br>He tried to communicate with the sword in his hand, but he didn&rsquo;t receive any response at all.<br>It was similar to the Divine Deer inside Chu Feng&rsquo;s body and the secret skill bestowed upon him by the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>They harnessed incredible powers and belonged to Chu Feng, but he was unable to use them. Given so, they were pretty much useless to him since he couldn&rsquo;t rely on them.<br>Weng!<br>All of a sudden, the hall tremored. The closed doors behind him opened up, revealing a massive spirit formation gate.<br>It was the same passageway which Chu Feng used to enter this hall.<br>With a deep sigh, Chu Feng stowed the Immemorial Hero&rsquo;s Sword away before stepping into the spirit formation gate.<br>Weng!<br>In the blink of an eye, he found himself returning back to the blue lake, where he had undergone a trial earlier.<br>The only difference was that the trial of the blue lake had vanished without a trace.<br>Shoosh!<br>Chu Feng leaped out of the blue lake amidst a splash of water, and he immediately turned his sights to the other two lakes.<br>&ldquo;Oh? Did she meet with trouble?&rdquo; Chu Feng frowned a little upon seeing the red lake.<br>Due to the transparency of the lake, he was able to see what was clearly going on inside.<br>Flames were rising from the red lake, and he could vaguely see the small silhouette of the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother in it.<br>She looked even smaller than an ant from where Chu Feng was at, such that no ordinary cultivator would have been able to find her within the lake. However, through his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, Chu Feng was able to tell that she was chained up by shackles forged out of flames.<br>It was apparent that she had been trapped by an extremely powerful formation and was in a very bad position at the moment.<br>At this rate, it wouldn&rsquo;t take long for her to die.<br>&ldquo;Are you intending to save her? She tried to kill you earlier.&rdquo;<br>A silhouette suddenly appeared behind Chu Feng. It was the bizarre-looking woman who was in charge of guarding the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Tomb of Armaments.<br>&ldquo;That elder helped me once before. I owe her a favor,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;The prowess of the formation inside the red lake surpasses your current capability. You might end up getting yourself trapped while trying to save her. Are you certain that it&rsquo;s worth doing it? Repaying kindness with kindness is a virtue, but recklessly throwing one&rsquo;s life away to repay a debt is nothing short of foolishness,&rdquo; the bizarre-looking lady said.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m grateful for your kind warning, but I know what I&rsquo;m doing.&rdquo;<br>After saying these words, Chu Feng leaped right into the red lake.<br>Staring at the lake, the bizarre-looking woman saw Chu Feng whipping out the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk. With his strength enhanced by it, he began working on breaching the formation which had trapped the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother.<br>&ldquo;That little brat actually has such treasure on him?&rdquo;<br>Slight astonishment rippled in the eyes of the bizarre-looking woman when she saw the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hands.<br>&ldquo;The prowess of that treasure far surpasses what he can feasibly control. Who knows whether it&rsquo;ll be a blessing or a calamity for him&hellip;&rdquo;<br>As she spoke such words, the bizarre-looking woman turned around before vanishing into thin air.<br>Meanwhile, Chu Feng as using the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk as a foundation to construct a formation to draw out its strength. Through this, he was able to utilize a power far beyond what he could usually tap into.<br>But despite so, he was still under great pressure trying to save the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother.<br>Hualala!<br>Finally, as a towering pillar of water rose into the air, two figures were ejected out from the red lake.<br>They were Chu Feng and the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother.<br>The two of them were extremely feeble at this moment. The disciple of the Godwish Grandmother was covered with burn marks all over, and one could even smell the subtle aroma of cooked meat coming from her.<br>As for Chu Feng, even though he didn&rsquo;t have too many visible injuries on him, he was completely sapped at the moment. He had overexerted himself once more using the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk earlier.<br>&ldquo;Now that you have obtained the Immemorial Hero&rsquo;s Sword, you&rsquo;re going to attempt to play the hero and win my gratitude, huh?&rdquo;<br>Looking at Chu Feng, who had just saved her a moment ago, the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother showed no signs of gratitude at all. Instead, she began mocking him coldly.<br>&ldquo;Elder, there&rsquo;s no need to thank me for this. You can thank it instead. If it hadn&rsquo;t willingly exerted its prowess, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to do anything about the situation either,&rdquo; Chu Feng remarked as he shook the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk in his hand.<br>&ldquo;Pui! Stop putting on that hypocritical act before me! Why should I thank you? Are you worthy of me doing that?&rdquo;<br>The disciple of the Godwish Grandmother berated him furiously.<br>On the other hand, Chu Feng showed no signs of losing his temper at all. Instead, he calmly put away his Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk before jumping into the white lake.<br>That was the way leading out of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Tomb of Armaments.<br>&ldquo;That darned brat. Even without your help, I would have been able to free myself!&rdquo; the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother harrumphed in fury.<br>Weng!<br>But at this very moment, a burst of light appeared above the red lake. A silhouette formed within the light, and it was no other than Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng was gazing down on the red lake with a tight knit on his forehead, fully displaying his worry.<br>&ldquo;Are you intending to save her? She tried to kill you earlier.&rdquo;<br>A figure suddenly appeared behind Chu Feng, and it was that bizarre-looking woman.<br>As it turned out, these two figures were images that were formed using some sort of special item.<br>Following that, the conversation between Chu Feng and the bizarre-looking woman was re-enacted once more. After showing everything, the light began to contract inward before eventually disappearing amidst a rock floating in midair.<br>And a person was holding the rock up&mdash;the bizarre-looking woman.<br>&ldquo;Elder, what does this mean?&rdquo; the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a re-enactment of what happened earlier,&rdquo; the bizarre-looking woman replied.<br>&ldquo;Elder, why are you showing this scene to me? Are you trying to tell me that I have wronged Chu Feng?&rdquo; the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother asked.<br>&ldquo;He has already obtained the Immemorial Hero&rsquo;s Sword. You can decide for yourself whether you have wronged him or not,&rdquo; the bizarre-looking woman replied.<br>Hearing those words, the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother fell silent.<br>Her fury suddenly fizzled away into a wisp of smoke, replaced by a heavy mood instead.<br>&ldquo;I should also tell you that Chu Feng has cleared the trial in the red lake for you, so you&rsquo;re now eligible to select a new weapon to challenge,&rdquo; the bizarre-looking woman said before vanishing into thin air.<br>The disciple of the Godwish Grandmother stood back up and gazed into the red lake. At the very bottom of the lake, a spirit formation gate had appeared.<br>The bizarre-looking woman wasn&rsquo;t lying to her. The trial in the red lake had indeed been cleared, and it was Chu Feng who did it for her.<br>All of a sudden, she felt even more conflicted than before.<br>Weng!<br>At this very instant, the bizarre-looking woman suddenly reappeared once more.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one more thing that I have forgotten to mention,&rdquo; the bizarre-looking woman said.<br></p></div>
