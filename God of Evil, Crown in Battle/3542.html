        <h1>Chapter 3541</h1>
        <div> - The Strength of The Clan Chief<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Heaven level Lightning Marks were indeed capable of increasing one&rsquo;s cultivation by a level. However, it should not be possible for it to allow the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief to so easily seriously injure Mo Song.<br>For the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief to be able to so easily seriously injure Mo Song, it meant that his actual cultivation was that of a rank nine Exalted to begin with.<br>It was precisely because he possessed a cultivation of rank nine Exalted to begin with that he was able to easily defeat Mo Song after unleashing his Heaven level Lightning Mark.<br>However, one must know that the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief of the Ten Great Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Li Heavenly Clan was only a rank eight Exalted.<br>For the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s cultivation to have reached rank nine Exalted, how could the crowd not be astonished?<br>Mo Song was not the only one with an appalled look on his face; the others present were actually even more alarmed.<br>That level of cultivation was simply inconsistent with the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief that they knew.<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief seemed to expect the astonished reactions of the crowd. Thus, he did not bother to pay attention to them. Instead, he opened his palm.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Martial power emerged from his palm and formed a half foot-long dagger.<br>That dagger was wriggling nonstop like a bug. It appeared truly strange.<br>&ldquo;This is an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill that this old man learned by pure coincidence.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is called Exalted Taboo: Soul-shattering Sword.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In a frontal confrontation, this Exalted Taboo: Soul-shattering Sword is truly lacking in power. However, if one is able to pierce it into another&rsquo;s body, that person will be subjected to enormous pain, and then die.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you are to confess honestly, I can spare your life. Otherwise&hellip; you will have to experience how powerful the torment of this Exalted Taboo: Soul-shattering Sword is,&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said while looking at Mo Song.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo; Faced with the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s threat, Mo Song burst into sudden laughter. Then, his gaze grew strangely determined. &ldquo;Never did I expect that you actually possessed such a cultivation. You&rsquo;ve concealed yourself quite well. Today, I have miscalculated. But&hellip; our Blood-devouring Demon Clan will definitely avenge me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chi~~~&rdquo;<br>After he finished saying those words, the crimson wounds on his body started to spray out blood. The blood was emitting a crimson radiance. Mo Song started to shine brightly like a crimson sun.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu, be careful,&rdquo; the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief warned upon seeing that.<br>However, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief reacted as if he was already prepared for it. He flicked his finger, and the dagger in his hand shot toward Mo Song.<br>The instant the dagger entered Mo Song&rsquo;s body, golden light started to shine from within him, surrounding him completely.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a loud explosion was heard. The surroundings started to shake violently.<br>The light that surrounded Mo Song had disappeared, and Mo Song was nowhere to be seen. Only a pool of scarlet and blue liquid remained.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve long heard that the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen possessed very tightly-sealed mouths, and would decide to self-detonate when being forced to make confessions. Never would I have imagined that, after all these years have passed, they would still remain like this,&rdquo; sighed the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>At that moment, the crowd came to a realization that the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s dagger was simply not a method of torture. Instead, it was a technique against self-detonation.<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had already prepared against Mo Song&rsquo;s self-detonation from the very start. The words he spoke earlier were merely meant to frighten him.<br>That said, what shocked the crowd the most was not the meticulous planning of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. Instead, it was his cultivation.<br>The Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief stepped forward and said to the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, &ldquo;Brother Chu, truly never would I have expected that your cultivation was actually above mine. You&rsquo;ve truly concealed yourself well.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Clan Chief Chu is truly a well-concealed expert, truly a well-concealed expert.&rdquo; The various experts present also walked up to the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>The person who was acting the most eagerly attentive among them was that Moyi Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Moyi Qing.<br>Although the Moyi Heavenly Clan was very powerful, their Moyi Heavenly Clan would still treat peak Exalted-level experts very seriously. This held even more true for him, an elder.<br>This was especially true upon recalling how he had tried to snatch away the golden fruit from the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. Thinking back on it, he became extremely worried, and thus tried extra hard to curry favor with the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief so that he would not be blamed for his actions.<br>As for the others, they had actually all looked down on the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief earlier. However, they no longer dared to look down on him. After all, apart from Utmost Exalted-level experts, no one would dare to disrespect a peak Exalted expert.<br>However, in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield, the number of Utmost Exalted-level experts numbered so very few.<br>From this, one could tell how powerful peak Exalted experts were. They were beings that were only a step away from becoming Utmost Exalted.<br>They were people that possessed the greatest power in the Ancestral Martial Starfield apart from Utmost Exalted-level experts.<br>That said, at the same time as the crowd was astonished by the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s cultivation, they were also feeling great admiration for his tolerance.<br>The crowd all felt that the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had become a rank nine Exalted long ago. He was simply not a nobody at all. Merely, he was hiding his cultivation the entire time.<br>All these years, he had not revealed his actual cultivation, and was humiliated, suppressed and injured by others. Yet, he still endured it. This sort of tolerance was simply worthy of the crowd&rsquo;s admiration.<br>&ldquo;Actually, this old man truly didn&rsquo;t deliberately conceal his cultivation. It is all thanks to Chu Feng that I possess my current cultivation,&rdquo; the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng? Brother Chu, stop joking,&rdquo; The crowd all felt that the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was joking.<br>No matter how powerful Chu Feng might be, he couldn&rsquo;t possibly be able to help the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief increase his cultivation.<br>After all, Chu Feng himself was only a Rank One Exalted.<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief smiled at the crowd&rsquo;s reaction. He did not try to explain things to them. However, he himself knew very well that it was indeed all thanks to Chu Feng that he was able to possess his current cultivation.<br>Back in the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s remnant, many experts had returned empty-handed.<br>Yet, Chu Feng, through his own ability, was able to obtain a great amount of cultivation resources. Furthermore, those cultivation resources were enormously helpful toward Exalted-level experts. It was capable of increasing their cultivation greatly in a short period of time.<br>It was precisely through using those cultivation resources that the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s cultivation had rapidly increased from rank five Exalted to rank nine Exalted.<br>He had trained for so many years with his cultivation progressing very slowly. Yet, by using only those treasures, he was able to increase his cultivation by so much in such a short time.<br>No one would believe him if he mentioned this to them. In fact, if he heard of this matter happening to someone else, he himself would suspect its validity.<br>However, as this had happened to him, he had no choice but to believe it.<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief knew very well that even if he attempted to explain it to the crowd, they would not believe him. Thus, he decided to not bother explaining it to them.<br></p></div>
