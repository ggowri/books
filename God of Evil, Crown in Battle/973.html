        <h1>Chapter 973</h1>
        <div> - Long Live Sect Head<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>Having finally killed Jiang Qisha, the pressure of the Firmament Slash disappeared and receded into Chu Feng&rsquo;s body, returning the world to its former serenity.<br>Silence permeated the sky. Everyone quietly looked at Chu Feng and remained wordless.<br>Chu Feng, with his strength alone, killed the peak experts from the Immortal Execution Archipelago and even killed the three geniuses from the Holy Land of Martialism. His strength shocked others, and his actions had a devastating impact on the outcome of the battle<br>Everyone became convinced of Chu Feng&rsquo;s power. Not only would they never forget his actions today, everyone else in the future&mdash;the Eastern Sea Region&rsquo;s successors&mdash;would discuss this for years to come because his accomplishments were destined to be recorded in the books of history. He was fated to become a figure of admiration and worship.<br>However, while the people from the Crippling Night Demon Sect were celebrating inside, the people from the Immortal Execution Archipelago and the Three Great Monstrous Clans were terrified. As the hundred million observers from various areas in the Eastern Sea Region sighed in admiration, Chu Feng opened his palm, and a boundless suction power surged out.<br>Despite its power, the suction force did not affect anyone. However, before such force, Jiang Qisha&rsquo;s fiery-red halberd, Zhao Yuetian&rsquo;s and the others&rsquo; Royal Armaments, and their Cosmos Sacks, all landed into Chu Feng&rsquo;s hands.<br>More importantly, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t just strip away their belongings. An invisible power was also surging into Chu Feng&rsquo;s body&mdash;Source Energy. Although Chu Feng killed their bodies and souls, he retained their Source Energy. Right now, he was absorbing it and feeding it into Eggy.<br>&ldquo;Lord Chu Feng, spare us!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Chu Feng, spare us!&rdquo;<br>Just at that moment, an expert from the Immortal Execution Archipelago knelt onto the ground, kowtowing and asking for forgiveness. Quickly following that, many experts from the Three Great Monstrous Clans also knelt and begged for forgiveness.<br>Everyone else was no exception. Even people like Jiang Qisha and Murong Mingtian were killed, so how could<br>they<br>possibly stand a chance against Chu Feng? Begging was their best option.<br>*hmm* Seeing that, Chu Feng willed a boundless pressure to spread out. It enveloped the members of Immortal Execution Archipelago and the Three Great Monstrous Clans.<br>*bang bang bang bang&hellip;* After enveloping them, there were bursts of muffled explosions that started sounding within the sea of people. Every single explosion meant the death of a life as it became a pool of blood.<br>Chu Feng, in a mere instant, with his own strength, killed several dozen thousand people from the Immortal Execution Archipelago.<br>&ldquo;Lord Chu Feng, spare us! Give us another chance!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Chu Feng, I have the old to look over and the young to care! They are still waiting for me in my home! Without me, they won&rsquo;t be able to survive! Please spare me!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Chu Feng, spare us&mdash;&rdquo;<br>The people from the Immortal Execution Archipelago and the Three Great Monstrous Clans were all stupefied. Those who hadn&rsquo;t knelt now did and started kowtowing as well while they too begged Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Hoh&hellip;&rdquo; However, as he faced their tragic cries, Chu Feng merely let out a light chuckle. Then, he said, &ldquo;In the clash of two armies, each serves their respective master. You&rsquo;ve done nothing wrong.<br>&ldquo;But the winner is the king, and the loser is the villain. To be softhearted towards one&rsquo;s enemy is to be cruel towards oneself. If I were the one defeated today, I&rsquo;m sure no one would sympathize with me. So&hellip; I do not care how great your desire is to live. I will not allow any to survive.<br>&ldquo;If you must blame someone, you can only blame yourself for following the wrong master. If you must blame something, you can only blame your own actions for making me an enemy.&rdquo;<br>After speaking, a chilly glint emerged into Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes. Then, he yelled, &ldquo;Crippling Night Demon Sect, attention! The Immortal Execution Archipelago and the Three Great Monstrous Clans are to be all killed. Leave none alive!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;KILL&mdash;&rdquo;<br>After he spoke, the Crippling Night Demon Sect&rsquo;s army once again became bloodthirsty demons. They released their boundless bloodlust as they all used various techniques, rushing again into the formation of the Immortal Execution Archipelago and the Three Great Monstrous Clans. They started slaughtering.<br>The people from the Immortal Execution Archipelago and the Three Great Monstrous Clans wanted to fight for their lives. Even if they were to die, they were going to bring a few along with them. But it was useless, as they had no chance with Chu Feng there.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s pressure froze them in their kneeling state. They couldn&rsquo;t even take half a step, let alone defending. Awaiting them was only a merciless annihilation.<br>For a brief while, endless painful cries rang out in the sky. Countless bodies started falling, and large amounts of blood sprayed down like a rain of blood. It entered the sea beneath, causing it to be dyed crimson.<br>Terror filled everyone who was unrelated to Chu Feng, such as the observers. They would have never thought he would be this ruthless. They didn&rsquo;t expect he would truly completely kill off the Immortal Execution Archipelago and the Three Great Monstrous Clans.<br>They were worried&mdash;worried whether Chu Feng would be consumed by blood and kill even them. After all, they had come here today to participate in the wedding of Jiang Qisha and Zi Ling. In the end, their actions were a type of humiliation towards Chu Feng.<br>But their worry was redundant. Although he was cruel towards his enemies, Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t insane. He wouldn&rsquo;t kill the innocent. Even though the observers were detestable, it was not to the degree that they deserved death.<br>Just in such a manner, the people from the Immortal Execution Archipelago and the Three Great Monstrous Clans were completely annihilated by the Crippling Night Demon Sect&rsquo;s army. Not a single person was left alive.<br>Although they did not have too great of a strength, there was, after all, a large number of people. Thus, Chu Feng did not abandon their Source Energy. He absorbed it all and gave it to Eggy.<br>At that moment, the members of the Crippling Night Demon Sect stood orderly in the air. They paid their respects towards Chu Feng and at the same time, and shouted simultaneously, &ldquo;LONG LIVE SECT HEAD!<br>&ldquo;LONG LIVE SECT HEAD!<br>&ldquo;LONG LIVE SECT HEAD!<br>&ldquo;LONG LIVE SECT HEAD!&rdquo;<br>Those four words thunderously resounded endlessly. The people from the Crippling Night Demon Sect were truly excited because the powerful strength Chu Feng showed them was something even the former sect head couldn&rsquo;t do.<br>His strength let everyone know that their decision was right: Chu Feng not only had the qualifications to become their sect head, they even felt he would surpass all former sect heads and become the greatest existence in the history of the Crippling Night Demon Sect.<br>At that instant, Zi Ling, Su Rou, Su Mei, Jiang Wushang, Zhang Tianyi, Chun Wu, Qiushui Fuyan, Taikou, Qiu Canfeng, and the others...<br>Those dear to Chu Feng were brimming with a joyous smile on their faces. They felt happiness from the bottom of their hearts. They felt pride for Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s strong performance astounded others; those who could have befriended him yet missed the chance felt intense regret. Their emotions were very complicated.<br>Xia Yu and Dong Xue were the representatives of those people. Although Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t do much to them, they knew very well that making Chu Feng an enemy was their largest failure in life.<br>They knew Chu Feng would become very strong. So strong it&rsquo;d be unimaginable. At that time, from what they knew of him, he would definitely help the ones close to him. Chun Wu and the others were within that group. However, Xia Yu and Dong Xue&hellip; they&hellip; they would never be qualified to receive Chu Feng&rsquo;s assistance.<br>They and Chun Wu were already on two different levels. On the road of cultivation, Chun Wu would leave them further and further behind. They had been put into the exact same situation as Chun Wu, but&hellip; they just chose the wrong path.<br>So, at that very moment, they truly hated themselves. They hated their ignorance. They hated their failed judgement. Not only did they give up a huge opportunity to befriend Chu Feng, they even made him an enemy. If they had&hellip;<br>But sadly, there was no medicine for regret in this world. They were fated to pay the price for their very actions. What they could do was represented by two words: eternal regret.<br></p></div>
