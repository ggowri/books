  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's form transformed into a colossal radiant being, a kaleidoscopic spectrum enveloping the space, encasing Mosley within it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The instant Mosley found herself ensnared, she let out an indignant shriek, her voice carrying a palpable wave of powerful mental assault that nearly shattered Osborne's Light Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mosley seethed, her voice laced with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn you! Damn you to hell! I detest the sanctity of this light; it makes me feel nauseated! You, a mere insect from the Blue Planet, have somehow mastered this power. You're doomed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she was spurred into a berserk fury, Mosley's power surged forth, wreaking havoc. Yet, to Osborne's surprise, Mosley's form began to dissipate under the influence of the Light Realm, reminiscent of ice melting under the sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body twitched and crackled as if scorched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne exulted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "It's working! The Light Realm is affecting her more than I imagined. I haven't done anything, and already Mosley is wounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this rate, if I can just hold on for a few more minutes, Mosley will be obliterated by my Light Realm. But can I hold on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unleashing her divine power, Mosley rammed into the Light Realm with a force that sent shockwaves through the space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Osborne's astonishment, his Light Realm, sturdy even against powerhouses like Cuthbert or Marvin, crumbled like shattered glass under the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blast it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne spat out a mouthful of blood, his face paling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's so powerful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mosley's single attack had demolished his Light Realm, throwing his plans into disarray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, Mosley also bore visible scars, her once impervious form now pockmarked and mangled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her icy gaze locked on Osborne, filled with a murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you, a mere mortal, wield such potent holy light that has brought my recovering form back to ruin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will rip out your heart and drain your blood, then impale your skull to suck out your brain! Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mosley's voice dripped with a malicious resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fury born of desperation, Mosley unleashed her divine power in a relentless assault, each blow akin to mountains crashing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne braced himself, his martial art aura flaring up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rock Smasher, shatter!" Osborne cried, his weapon slicing through the air with a blinding speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, a thunderous crash echoed through the air as Osborne was hurled violently against the mountainside. He slammed into the rocky surface, blood oozing from his mouth, nose, and ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Osborne could even think about recovering, Mosley was already right in front of him. Her terrifying wings, sharp as blades, came slicing down towards his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperately, Osborne raised the Rock Smasher in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact was immense. Osborne's body was sent flying once more, and a sizable crack marred the surface of the Rock Smasher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Rock Smasher is a Premium divine artifact, yet Mosley's wings are leaving dents? A few more blows, and it might get sliced right through!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just how strong is she?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was a mask of worry. Even though he managed to wound Mosley with his Light Realm, it seemed to have little effect on her. Instead, it had only served to fuel her rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mosley's attacks were unrelenting. Osborne could only fend off her fury with the Rock Smasher and his martial art aura, but he was quickly nearing his breaking point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a pang of regret as he thought about how hasty he'd been in returning the swallow shield to Emma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had it now, he might have lasted a bit longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was sent flying once more by the force of Mosley's wings. The Rock Smasher now had more than a dozen deep gashes and was on the verge of shattering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting his teeth, Osborne quickly put away the Rock Smasher and grabbed the Goddess of Grain's Scythe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Mosley's wings came crashing down again, Osborne decided to go on the offensive. He swung the scythe with all his might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see whether your wings or my scythe is sharper!" Osborne roared, pouring all his strength into the attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, the Goddess of Grain's Scythe met Mosley's fearsome wings in a violent clash.</span></p><div class="pagination">
