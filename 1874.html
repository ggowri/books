  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uncle Zachary, I have nothing else to do around here anyhow. I also want to go a few rounds. Please, enlighten me," Osborne said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary, standing at the highest Deity King Level, found Osborne to be a worthy opponent. Without hesitation, he agreed to Osborne's request for a competition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't concerned about revealing his identity; he just didn't want Zachary to worry about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt confident that after their battle, Zachary would no longer have to be worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary was momentarily taken aback by Osborne's response. He muttered to himself, "Am I imagining things? Is he really Osborne, and Theodore from Astral Wolf Peak just a disguise?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless, Zachary was pleased that Osborne was willing to compete with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He declared confidently, "Alright, let me show you something. I'm not bragging, but I'm quite strong. The Hudson family boasts over a thousand Deity Kings at the highest level. I won't claim I'd be in the top 10, but I believe I could easily make it into the top 50.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Below the Supernal Deity King level, few can stand against me. I can definitely offer some advice to a mid-level Deity King like you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Virgil, who had been watching from a distance, rushed over. "Dad, I need to say something!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary replied coolly, "Make it quick! Osborne and I are about to fight. Don't interrupt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Virgil thought to himself, "I'm your son! Why are you so warm towards Osborne but so cold to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling aggrieved, Virgil said, "Dad, you're at the highest Deity King Level. There is a huge gap between you two. It wouldn't be fair to Osborne. Why not let me go first?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary rolled his eyes. "Aren't you also at the advanced Deity King Level? You're one level higher than Osborne. Isn't that unfair if you compete with him? Plus, you're as good as a Deity King of the highest level."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then turned to Osborne. "Osborne, Virgil wants to compete with you as well. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled lightly, "Virgil is the top genius of the Hudson family's younger generation. I'm more than happy to fight him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Virgil beamed with excitement. "Don't worry, Osborne. I'll control my strength and promise not to hurt you. If I do, my dad will definitely deal with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eager to showcase his abilities, he was practically bouncing on his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, "Virgil, you should unleash your full strength. Don't hold back on my account. Otherwise, Uncle Zachary might give you an even harder time if you lose!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Virgil's eyes widened with surprise. "Osborne, you seem pretty confident! If that's the case, I won't hold back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go for it," Osborne replied with a faint smile, gesturing for Virgil to begin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Virgil glanced at Zachary, who glared back at him. "What are you looking at me for? Since Osborne has given you the green light, show what you've got. Don't underestimate him; he easily handled Kurt before. You might not be his match!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Virgil's expression turned serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Kurt was a mid-stage Deity King and technically at a lower level, he was still formidable. Defeating him wouldn't be easy for Virgil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm coming at you!" Virgil announced, channeling divine power that surged from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I'm at the advanced Deity King Level, my Divine Body is at level seven, and my wind-controlling elemental essence is at level eight. You better brace yourself," Virgil quickly detailed, as though worried Osborne wouldn't grasp the extent of his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Alright, Virgil! Let's see what you've got. You'll understand my strength once we're in it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay!" Virgil responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the younger generation of the Human Community, Virgil was undoubtedly at the top&mdash;at least in the top 20, with the potential to break into the top 10. He never thought he would lose to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a fierce wind began to swirl around him, shimmering with a metallic sheen. This wasn't just any wind; it was a violent gale, sharp and deadly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attack!" Virgil commanded, and the swirling gale shot toward Osborne, obliterating everything in their path with unstoppable force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary frowned, murmuring, "I told him to be cautious, but I didn't intend for him to unleash his full power. If he hurts Osborne, he'll be in real trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching with concern, Zachary was ready to help Osborne at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Virgil was the Hudson family's top young talent and was at the advanced Deity King Level, while Osborne was merely in the mid-stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also didn't believe Osborne could stand a chance against Virgil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the overwhelming gale closed in around him, Osborne found himself engulfed. His clothes whipped about wildly, and it seemed as if he would be torn apart by the ferocious gale at any moment.</span></p><div class="pagination">
