  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the blood energy left behind by 60 Class S clones after death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their overall strength might have a slight gap compared to a normal Class S, but their strength of the blood energy was definitely stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So much blood energy was enough to further enhance the strength of the Blood Demon members a little bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he got to break through to the Class S, perhaps there would still be a few Blood Demon members who also broke through Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finishing absorbing the blood energy, Osborne tore open the dimensional rift and left with Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, they appeared over a small island 99 miles away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bryce!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Kendra saw the two of them appear, she immediately came out from her hiding place, rushed into Bryce's arms, hugged him tightly, and started crying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bryce, it's good that you're alive! You're so lucky to be alive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The </span><span>Likreia</span><span> Mountain is gone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was crying loudly. Bryce, who had acted indifferent all the way, suddenly felt extremely sad as he heard what Kendra said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne did not disturb the two of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he rescued Bryce, </span><span>Likreia</span><span> Mountain had been destroyed, and all 8,000 pirates were killed by the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, only Bryce and Kendra were left in </span><span>Likreia</span><span> Mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he was carefree, he was just pretending to be strong. Bryce witnessed with his own eyes the destruction of </span><span>Likreia</span><span> Mountain and the killing of all his subordinates. He felt more pain in his heart than anyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he knew that it was useless to feel pain, so he didn't show it in front of Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until Bryce saw Kendra that he finally couldn't help it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two hugged each other and burst into tears. Osborne knew that Bryce was a very proud person and he certainly didn't want others to see him cry, so he stayed away from them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened the Draco Star Wristlet and checked the latest news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> had launched an all-out war, it was impossible for them to stop, and there was no force in the entire </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> that could stop them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These six coastal provinces, </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>, </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, </span><span>Oillpuee</span><span>, </span><span>Tyrisland</span><span>, Halyan, and Jalmar, had all been conquered by the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> at this time, and all the Ancient Families and superpowers in the six provinces had surrendered to the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because all those who did not surrender were slaughtered ruthlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> was rapidly advancing towards inland provinces such as Campbell and </span><span>Yunioe</span><span>, with a fast speed and destruction along the way, and no force could resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are they that fast?" Osborne murmured, frowning tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this rate, it would probably only take seven days for the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> to occupy all 50 provinces of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>. Hundreds of Ancient Families and dozens of superpowers in the entire </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> would all be destroyed by the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> or submit to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> would come at the Augustine family in Newport City!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, a sense of urgency emerged in his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seven days!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I cannot break through Class S in these seven days, the Augustine family cannot </span><span>stop the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>! Even if Gerardo doesn't take action, we will be defeated!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt the pressure like a mountain pressing on his shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After numerous Ancient Families and superpowers submit to the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, the strength of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> will become even stronger! The </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization and the League of Divine Descent will definitely send people to help them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can we fight with them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, he was even a little desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne suddenly remembered what Isa had said to him not long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are my man. If you can't even deal with the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, and the League of Divine Descent, then you should give up everything and be a little man by my side. I can protect you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your current opponents are only the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, and the League of Divine Descent. Although they are the top superpowers on Blue Planet, in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, they can't even survive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, Lord Malevolence and Dark Deity, as I mentioned before, are not jokes. They really exist! And in the near future, they will become our opponents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I hope you can solve the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, and the League of Divine Descent on your own and grow up quickly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When you did it, I will tell you more truth about the world! At that time, I can even take you to </span><span>Celestara</span><span> and experience more things!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne was somewhat unwilling to admit defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't it just the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood up, his eyes full of fighting spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Bryce and Kendra also came over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce looked at Osborne, smiled faintly, and said, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, </span><span>Likreia</span><span> Mountain's pirates are gone, and from now on, I will follow you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won't refuse me, will you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard that the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> has launched a war against the Augustine family, right? I can join the Augustine family, but my only request is to kill a few more members of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Osborne was surprised.</span></p><div class="pagination">
