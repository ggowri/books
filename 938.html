  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, only the Tauren King was able to brush off Osborne's attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Medusa Queen and Wolf King had to expend energy to shatter Osborne's Destruction Orbs and Disintegration Rays, preventing them from fully focusing on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the Class AAA clones, they were utterly helpless against the onslaught. Their pitiful screams echoed as they were swiftly overwhelmed, suffering grievous injuries before falling lifeless to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just two rounds of Osborne's relentless assault, all fifty Class AAA clones were wiped out, leaving him with only the three Class S clones to contend with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fury etched on their faces, the remaining clones glared at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa Queen roared, her voice dripping with rage. "Osborne, you're dead meat! You've slaughtered so many of us! We'll deliver your head to the great King of the Aberrants!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the light in Medusa's eyes intensified, and stone-like skin quickly began to grow around Osborne, attempting to petrify him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can kill me? I doubt you have what it takes! Break!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His martial art aura flared wildly, shattering the encroaching stone skin. Although he felt the effects of the petrification slowing him down, he was still able to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the best he could manage, given his Class AAA status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His martial art aura was formidable, but it still paled compared to the true strength of a Class S warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the Wolf King and Tauren King charged once more. The Wolf King swung his claws, unleashing a flurry of razor-sharp strikes aimed at tearing Osborne apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne barely registered the threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the Wolf King's attacks were powerful enough to breach his martial art aura, they only left shallow cuts on his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To truly injure him, the Wolf King would need to step up his game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The real danger lay with the Tauren King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was he incredibly resilient, but his charging power was terrifying. If Osborne miscalculated and got caught by one of those charges, he would undoubtedly suffer serious injury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Tauren King barreled toward him, Osborne quickly devised a plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If force can't break through that hide, then I'll use a weapon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, he reached into his Dimensional Space and pulled out the Goddess of Grain's scythe, fixing his gaze on the Tauren King with a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Goddess of Grain's scythe was the sharpest weapon Osborne had ever encountered; even a Premium divine artifact would struggle to match its cutting edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had no doubt that the Tauren King's thick hide wouldn't stand a chance against it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground shook as the Tauren King charged at Osborne, lowering his head and aiming his razor-sharp horns directly at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he connected, the Tauren King was confident he could seriously injure or even kill Osborne in one blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oblivious to the threat posed by the scythe in Osborne's hands, the Tauren King charged forward, his confidence in his own defense unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, that tiny scythe posed no threat to his massive frame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Prepare to meet your end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Tauren King lunged, Osborne seized the moment to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sidestepped the charge, narrowly evading the massive beast, and swung the Goddess of Grain's scythe down toward the Tauren King's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, the Tauren King's head snapped to the side, his sharp horns lunging toward Osborne's chest. The lingering effects of Medusa Queen's petrification power had slowed Osborne's reflexes, and he couldn't dodge in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting his teeth, Osborne swung the Goddess of Grain's scythe with all his might, determined to land a blow despite the imminent danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, one of the Tauren King's massive horns sliced through Osborne's martial art aura defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He whipped his head around, the sharp tip penetrating deep into Osborne's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Osborne struck back with the Goddess of Grain's scythe, bringing it down onto the Tauren King's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The razor-sharp scythe met the fearsome defense of the Tauren King but didn't falter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With surprising ease, it cut through the tough hide as if it were nothing more than a sheet of ordinary paper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Goddess of Grain's scythe cleaved through half of the Tauren King's neck, blood spraying in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moo!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Tauren King let out a chilling scream as the blade found its mark, his massive body crashing to the ground. Had he not been so large, that strike would have surely severed his head entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, the Tauren King could not survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet even in victory, Osborne was hardly unscathed. The Tauren King's razor-sharp horn had pierced his chest, leaving a gaping wound from which blood gushed rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the Wolf King appeared behind him, lunging forward with deadly intent. Its glistening teeth aimed a fierce bite at Osborne.</span></p><div class="pagination">
