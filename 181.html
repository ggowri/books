  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo shouted, but it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bright light shooting down from the drone was so fast that it hit Apollo and others instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, everyone felt tingling all over. The cells of their body seemed to boil, and the intense pain made them all scream and fall to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Apollo, although with a look of pain, did not fall down. He endured the severe pain and rushed out madly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attack from the drone finally stopped until he left the Radcliffe Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression was gloomy and highly terrible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "It's doomed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo confidently led his men to break into the Radcliffe Manor, but they were blocked just after entering several dozen yards. The armed robots and drones that appeared one after another knocked them down. Except for him, no one escaped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It must be the Class A defense system from the Draco Group! Only that system can be so powerful! Skyefall Security actually rented it to the Radcliffe family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo looked unhappy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In comparison, Donna and others in the monitoring room seemed extremely excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying power displayed by the Class A defense system satisfied them. Except for Apollo, who was in Class B and escaped, dozens of elites of Chevalier Security were all left behind!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such defensive power was too strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gibson, those people are not in danger, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna asked worriedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin smiled, "Don't worry, Ms. Donna Radcliffe. Our armed drones use electromagnetic energy to attack, and the intensity of the attack can be adjusted! The explosion just now was only 10% of its power, which will only make them lose their strength, not kill them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna was shocked at that. "It's only 10% of its power? If it's at full power, can Apollo still escape?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin said confidently, "No! What's more, our defense system has many means that we haven't used yet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna was immediately more excited. "Great! That's great! Mr. Gibson, I'm delighted with your Class A defense system. I will let someone transfer the balance to you right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With this defense system, Clarissa's safety is guaranteed! At least in the Radcliffe Manor, I don't have to worry about it anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Valentin smiled, "In fact, with this defense system, even if Ms. Radcliffe wants to leave the Radcliffe Manor for a short time, there is no need to worry about her safety."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gibson, what do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Clarissa looked at Valentin with great anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin smiled, "I mean, this defense system can be moved! You just need to hire eight more professional operators from Skyefall Security to operate it. Then, you can take some armed robots and drones out to protect Ms. Radcliffe anytime and anywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With our operators, as well as some armed robots and drones, even a Class B+ warrior couldn't hurt Ms. Radcliffe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna's breathing had become rapid at Valentin's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin nodded. "But the price of hiring our professional operators is a bit high! In the future, Skyefall Security will take the high-end route and only accept high-priced hires."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna waved her hand calmly. "How much? Mr. Gibson, please name a price!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "After paying the annual rental fee of 500 million dollars, it's nothing to hire eight more professional operators. Anyway, a defense system controlled by operators can withstand the attacks of a group of Class B+ strongmen!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It is the security that no amount of money can buy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Skyefall Security had not only one Class A defense system, Donna would have wanted to install such a system in the Radcliffe family's old mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The cost of hiring a professional operator is 30 million dollars per year! We have been worded together for many years, so I can give you a discount of five million dollars per person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin finished speaking, and Donna nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The annual hiring cost per person was as high as 25 million dollars, which was indeed a sky-high price, more than ten times higher than that of other security companies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were in the past, Donna would have thought Valentin was crazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after seeing the power of the Class A defense system, Donna felt it was worth it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Costing 200 million dollars a year to hire eight professional operators was expensive. But it was nothing for the Radcliffe family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The key was that by spending the extra 200 million dollars, Clarissa would no longer have to worry about her safety and could even leave the Radcliffe Manor freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least Donna thought it was worth it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, then I will hire eight professional operators! Mr. Gibson, thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna shook hands with Valentin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but laugh when he saw Valentin and Donna reach an employment cooperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was worthwhile that he spent 1.6 billion dollars on upgrading the equipment for the members of Skyefall Security, and he finally sold eight of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cost of hiring eight operators was 200 million dollars!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the latest distribution plan, Skyefall Security would get 80% of it, which was 160 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, as long as Skyefall Security could continue to demonstrate its strong strength, those who were influenced by the Chevalier family and refused to cooperate with Skyefall Security would sooner or later come to them for help!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With such a hiring price, Skyefall Security's profitability would be much stronger than before!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne would soon earn back the 1.6 billion dollars he had invested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before that, Osborne had to think of a way to deal with Apollo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Apollo was Clarissa's fianc&eacute;. If he couldn't kill Apollo, he would never be able to be with Clarissa and could not complete the fourth test of succession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne had cold, murderous intents in his eyes.</span></p><div class="pagination">
