  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain was swearing up a storm. He couldn't believe Osborne was still holding on. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Osborne's condition, Cain was sure he wouldn't survive the second phase of merging with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get it together!" Cain thought. "You need to escape this underground prison&mdash;twelve miles deep&mdash;before it's too late! If you can just reach the surface, even if you don't make it, I'll have a chance to find another destined one. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's still hope for freedom. But if you die here, I'll be trapped in this endless solitude for millennia. I can't bear that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued, "Damn it! You're useless! Even with the Cosmic Treasure in your hands, you're too weak to wield it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain's voice was a mix of frustration and fury, his anger bursting forth like a dam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, was too consumed by his own agony to heed Cain. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body felt like it was tearing apart as the roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity raced to merge with every organ and cell. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sensation was like a minor tremor escalating into a catastrophic earthquake, sending shockwaves through his flesh and blood. It was unbearable. If this continued, he was doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his body's collapse, transforming him into a grotesque figure of blood and flesh, Osborne forced himself to think clearly. He needed a way to survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Light Realm! Light of Redemption!" he cried out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his body neared total collapse, Osborne unleashed the Light of Redemption. It was his last hope, the only thing keeping him grounded amidst the chaos. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But shock hit him as the Light of Redemption enveloped him, failing to heal and instead accelerating his deterioration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?" Panic gripped Osborne. The Light of Redemption was his trump card. He had hoped to use the Light Realm and the Light of Redemption to heal his failing body. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could just hold on until the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity completed its second phase of merging, he would survive. But now, the Light of Redemption was utterly ineffective!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain sneered, his voice dripping with disdain. "What a waste! Just give up! Your body is collapsing because of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That thing is a Cosmic Treasure, its power far surpassing divine power! How could any ordinary healing method fix the damage it causes? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your body can't handle the second phase of the merge. The only outcome is your death! Even if a Deity King were here, they'd just have to watch you die. There's nothing anyone could do to save you! Unless the Goddess of Life were here..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain seemed resigned to the grim reality. Osborne's condition was dire; escaping with Cain was out of the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face darkened at Cain's words. "Even a Deity King couldn't save me? Am I just supposed to watch my life slip away? No! I refuse to believe that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa! Isa!" Osborne cried out, desperate to cling to life. He needed to act fast. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he screamed Isa's name, hoping she would come to his aid. Isa, a </span><span>formidable disciple of the God of Night and a top-tier physician, was his last hope. In the past, just mentioning her name would bring her close, whether she revealed herself or not.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time was different. Osborne called out to Isa repeatedly, but she didn't appear. His body continued to disintegrate under the overwhelming force of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His flesh turned to blood, dripping like melting ice. His bones crumbled, and the situation grew more dire with each passing moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperation set in. Osborne knew he was near death. Isa's lack of response meant either she hadn't heard him, or she was unable to come. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair washed over him as he tried every method he could think of to halt his body's extinction, to no avail. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched helplessly as his flesh and bones disintegrated. Hope was slipping away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain observed coldly, his hands tied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured to himself, "Is it really over?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bit his lip fiercely, determination flaring. "No! I can't die! There's so much left undone, so many people who need me. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I absolutely can't die! If I can't stop the disintegration of my body and bones, then... I'll forsake this body! I will begin forging a Divine Body now! Divine Bones, Divine Flesh! Even if it means my death, I'll give it my all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that resolve, Osborne erupted into action. He immediately activated the Breath of Celestial.</span></p><div class="pagination">
