  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? The Arctic Maw Chasm?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Rupert's words slipped out, the place went up in a storm of noise. At least half of the people there looked like they'd seen a ghost, Agatha and Horace included.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other half were just blank-faced because they'd never even heard of the "Arctic Maw Chasm".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In neither his past life nor this one had he ever come across the name Arctic Maw Chasm. But looking at everyone's faces around him, he knew this place was no joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly hollered at Gustave, who wasn't too far off, "Gustave, what is the Arctic Maw Chasm? Is there something fishy about this place?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave looked as serious as a heart attack at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Osborne's question, he replied right away, "Osborne, you guys are from Tempest Fortress City. It's miles away from Frost Peak City, so it's no wonder you've never heard of the Arctic Maw Chasm! But folks around Frost Peak City all know about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's basically a no-go zone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's gobbled up countless Empyrean Sacredness powerhouses. Even the big-wigs at the Empyrean Sacredness level don't just waltz into the Arctic Maw Chasm. They might just end up in there for good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he said this, Gustave let out a wry smile. "I never thought they'd pick the Arctic Maw Chasm as the venue for our state duel! What are the Zephyr State officials thinking? Do they want us to go and get ourselves killed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but raise an eyebrow. He figured things couldn't be that cut-and-dried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The folks taking part in the state duel were the top dogs just below the Empyrean Sacredness level in the whole Zephyr State. The Zephyr State officials surely wouldn't send them to their graves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, the major powers would kick up a huge stink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Rupert continued, "Pipe down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, chill out! We're well aware of how dangerous the Arctic Maw Chasm is. We're not gonna send you to your doom! Not every nook and cranny of the Arctic Maw Chasm is a death trap!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Zephyr State officials have done a pretty thorough exploration of the whole Arctic Maw Chasm. It's divided into nine layers! Given your strength, the first three layers are a piece of cake. Apart from the rough and tricky environment, there won't be too many headaches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, the fourth to sixth layers? That's a whole different ballgame for most of you. It's not a guaranteed one-way ticket, but it's easy to get in a bind. So, play it smart. If you're not feeling confident, stay above the fourth layer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for the seventh to ninth layers, those are seriously off-limits!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even an Empyrean Sacredness warrior has a high chance of biting the dust if they enter the seventh layer. And the eighth layer? Even if I went down there, I'd probably be a goner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And as for the ninth layer, no one's ever come out of the ninth layer alive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for whether there's a tenth layer below the ninth, well, it's anyone's guess. But that's none of your business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The tokens for the state duel will be spread out across the first six layers of the Arctic Maw Chasm. There are six kinds of tokens, each worth different points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tokens on the first layer? They're worth one point!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tokens on the second layer? That's ten points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tokens on the third layer? A cool hundred points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tokens on the fourth layer? A thousand points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tokens on the fifth layer? Ten thousand points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tokens on the sixth layer A whopping hundred thousand points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure thing, the deeper you venture into the Arctic Maw Chasm, the hotter the fire gets, and the fewer tokens you'll find. So, I'm telling you, play it by ear. Don't go diving into the deeper layers just because the tokens there are worth a fortune. It's not worth the risk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, finding tokens isn't the only way to rack up points. You can also swipe tokens and points from others. As long as you can take down your opponent, you'll score one-tenth of their points! Sweet deal, huh?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the end, it's all about who's got the most points. That's how you win this thing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Rupert finished speaking, the crowd broke into another flurry of chatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, folks! Now, I'm gonna take you to check out the Arctic Maw Chasm. Keep in mind, you've got one day to get the lay of the land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Throughout this day, there'll be referees tagging along with you. You'll head down into the Arctic Maw Chasm yourselves to feel the danger. When the actual state duel kicks off, you can pick which layer you want to </span><span>stay in</span><span> on right off the bat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By then, if you run into trouble, the referees will jump in to save your bacon, but that also means you're out of the state duel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he said his piece, Rupert's power suddenly washed over everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, a huge Translocator sparked to life. The next second, the world started spinning for everyone. When they finally got their bearings, they found themselves in a winter wonderland of snow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right in front of them stood a glistening ice forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bone-chilling cold instantly made everyone's blood run cold, and their faces turned as white as sheets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were the top guns below the Empyrean Sacredness level, and yet they were feeling the cold? That was something else!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This situation showed that the surrounding environment was so brutal that an ordinary person wouldn't stand a snowball's chance in hell of surviving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara groaned, her face looking grim, "It's freezing! Is this the Arctic Maw Chasm?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Gustave said in a serious tone, "Nah! We ain't even stepped foot inside the Arctic Maw Chasm yet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're still outside the place. The conditions in there are way worse than this. Inside, there are gale-force winds that could turn us into human ice cubes in no time. Even on the first layer, you gotta keep pumping out divine or Sacred Power to stay alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm guessing that most of the thousand participants will only be able to handle the first three layers. If they try to enter the fourth layer, they'll either freeze solid within minutes or run into all sorts of other trouble. Maybe only one or two hundred folks will be able to search for tokens on the fourth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And the number of people who can make it to the fifth layer probably won't top twenty!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for those who can enter the sixth layer, probably just Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The other folks in the top ten might not even be able to search for tokens on the sixth layer. And even if they can, it'll be a real dicey situation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Gustave finished, Clara's expression turned even grimmer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to look at Osborne. "Osborne, which layer should we head to for those tokens?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged. "I'm not sure yet. Let's go in and scope it out first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the whole group started moving forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the glistening ice forest, there was a massive fissure that led deep into the glacier. Once they stepped into the fissure, everyone instantly felt the air turn even colder. The biting wind was like a freezer blast, threatening to turn their blood to ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne noticed that a lot of the folks lower on the power rankings already had faces as white as a ghost. They had to start channeling their divine power just to keep themselves from freezing solid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, they still hadn't even reached the first layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they trekked through the fissure for a while, a labyrinth of underground ice tunnels unfurled before them, looking like an otherworldly subterranean realm. And all of a sudden, the howling cold wind kicked up a notch, getting even more ferocious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More folks couldn't take the brunt of that frigid wind anymore and started conjuring up their divine power to shield themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rupert spoke up, "This here is the first layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm! This layer's spread out over a big area, but the environment ain't too gnarly, and the cold wind's not that strong. Take a feel of the situation. We'll make our way to the second layer."</span></p><div class="pagination">
