  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only after all enemies were defeated did Clarissa relax, storing the Fate Staff and embracing Osborne tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne also hugged her, feeling her slight tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, I'm sorry that I came late. You must be scared."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Clarissa shook her head vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lifted her head from Osborne's embrace, stood on her toes, embraced his neck, and kissed him. Her actions were passionate and assertive as if she sought to release all the grievances, anxiety, and fear she had bottled up inside during this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sensed Clarissa's expectations, hugged her waist tightly, and responded to her kiss enthusiastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither of them noticed that Dylan and Eugen, who were not far away, had extremely dark expressions on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked at each other but ultimately did not dare to interrupt the kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because they were afraid!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was ruthless, eliminating all Class B members of the Paltrow family, including Robert, Alexander, and Wade. All were killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Paltrow family was doomed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was like a Satan. He broke in alone and started his slaughter, with no one </span><span>being able to stop him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Evelynn, Charlie, and others who came from Newport City who dared to stop Osborne were severely humiliated and taught a lesson by Osborne, fleeing away in embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So how dare Dylan and Eugen stop them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long time, Osborne and Clarissa separated. Clarissa was panting, her pretty face extremely red, and her eyes full of tenderness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, take me away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne considered it and said, "Don't worry, I have something to deal with."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he looked at Dylan and Eugen, both of whom changed their expressions but pretended to remain calm as they looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said to Dylan, "Mr. Radcliffe, a month ago, you believed that I was not worthy of Clarissa, so you took her away from me and wanted to marry her to Alexander, who was better than me in every way in your eyes. At that time, we agreed that I would come to </span><span>Dampston</span><span> and defeat Alexander, proving that I was better and more robust than Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I have done it. According to our agreement, can you marry Clarissa to me now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's pretty face reddened even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Dylan with a highly proud look, as if she was saying to Dylan, "Dad, did you see it? I have told you that the man I pick is the best!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan's face was extremely gloomy at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's words were like slaps in the face, striking him again and again, but he had no way to refute them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A month ago, he really felt that Osborne was inferior to Alexander in every aspect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A month ago, he did look down on Osborne and forcibly separated him and Clarissa and took Clarissa to </span><span>Dampston</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A month ago, he personally made an agreement with Osborne that as long as Osborne could go to </span><span>Dampston</span><span> and defeat Alexander, he would agree to marry Clarissa to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, Osborne had done it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did he defeat Alexander, but he also assassinated him and executed the Paltrow family's senior leaders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne proved with his actions that he was more potent, more outstanding, and more worthy of Clarissa than Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the agreement, Dylan should agree to Clarissa's marriage with Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan's face was incredibly gloomy, but he finally gritted his teeth and said, "I'm sorry. I still can't marry Clarissa to you! Clarissa is my daughter. I can't let her die with you, or even implicate the entire Radcliffe family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, Clarissa became anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, how could you? You don't keep your promise!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan gritted his teeth. "I didn't mean to break my promise, but Osborne is too </span><span>arrogant! If he just killed the Paltrow family, I would let you marry him without hesitation because he has proven his ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But he was so arrogant that he offended the Augustine family in Newport City! He even dared to offend, humiliate, and even beat up the descendant of the Augustine family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's the Augustine family, the oldest family in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne is simply crazy. He has offended the Augustine family. Will he still have a future? The Augustine family will not let him go and will definitely retaliate against him, and the revenge will come soon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you marry Osborne, the Augustine family will take revenge on you as well. Even our family will not be spared and will be implicated by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Augustine family can destroy our family with just a flick of their fingers! Hundreds of our family members and thousands of branch members will be killed because of him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me, how can I marry you to him?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing his excited words, Clarissa couldn't utter a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugen also had a severe expression and said, "Clarissa, for the sake of the Radcliffe family, you must break up with him! Otherwise, thousands of people in our family will be slaughtered because of you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your aunt Donna, your cousin Barlyn. They will all be killed due to your willfulness!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For the Radcliffe family, you must sever your ties with Osborne, right now!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
