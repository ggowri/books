        <h1>Chapter 13 Trading Day</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph was caught completely off guard, tumbling off the bed. Fuming, she shot back, "You idiot! Why are you treating me like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony looked down at her with a mocking smirk. "You're my gift, so I can have you </span><span>whenever I feel like it. Right now? I'm just not interested."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph's expression suddenly softened into a smile. "Smart guy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, a series of sharp spikes erupted from her smooth skin, covering her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony blinked in surprise. "So, you really are a rose with thorns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's this all about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph ran a hand over the spikes, a look of pride in her eyes. "This is a bionic suit, the latest creation from the Godfather's research institute."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony let out a long sigh. "Just like the bionic wings... I guess I'm still not worthy of having one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her smile grew even more charming. "Well, that's up to you. I'm heading off to take a shower now. And just so you know, this time, I'll be taking everything off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you've got the guts, come right in. I won't lock the door."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a final teasing glance, she walked away, her movements graceful and sensual, like a sleek, seductive cat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony swallowed hard. He was lucky to have had the Devil Eye's warning earlier. Otherwise, he might have acted recklessly and ended up not only suffering but losing all his dignity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pushing those thoughts aside, he quickly activated the Devil Eye to check the Dragon Ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dragon Ring had leveled up from its previous selection mode to a one-star Dragon Ring. Next to the slot for the Dragonfang, there was now a small yellow booklet titled "Energy-absorbing Breathing".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice of the Devil Eye echoed in his mind. "Energy-absorbing Breathing can purify your body, enhance your mental power, and sustain the energy needed for the Devil Eye."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony remembered the near-death experience at the banquet when his energy had been drained, causing the Devil Eye to fail just when he needed it most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly selected "Read", and a flood of deep, esoteric knowledge rushed into his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he had familiarized himself with Energy-absorbing Breathing, he continued exploring the Dragon Ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, a shopping panel had appeared. His current level was one-star member, and he had ten thousand gold coins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only item available for purchase was a pistol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flipping further, he saw Seraph's bionic wings and bionic armor listed as well, but the price was hidden, and he didn't have access to buy them. Just looking at the length of the numbers made it clear that the price would be astronomical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he couldn't afford those, he turned his attention back to the pistol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a classic weapon from the Godfather Research Institute, M9 Micro Submachine Gun. It came with two magazines, each holding 100 rounds. The price for the pistol was five thousand gold coins. Each bullet cost ten gold coins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony felt a pang of disappointment. With only ten thousand gold coins to his name, he couldn't afford it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had he known that this pistol could be sold for a million gold coins on the black market, with each bullet going for over a thousand coins, he wouldn't have thought it was expensive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But right now, he was broke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three years with the Smith family had earned him nothing, and in the end, he'd been thrown out with nothing but the clothes on his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was well aware that Alvin and Anne would stop at nothing to hunt him down, using all the resources at their disposal. With a determined grimace, he bit the bullet and bought a handgun, along with two hundred rounds of ammunition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That set him back seven thousand gold coins, leaving him with just three thousand remaining in his account.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed money, and he needed it fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With enough cash, he could buy all the ammunition he could ever use and even hire some reliable bodyguards, equipping them with M9 pistols to ensure his safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The M9 had tremendous firepower, and Anthony was sure that even the Warrior from the night before wouldn't have been able to survive a shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But here he was, all alone in Yoland, with no allies and no idea where to find the money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustrated, he made his way to the neighboring room and knocked on Seraph's door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, the door opened with barely a touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She didn't lock the door?" Anthony thought, his mind racing. "Is she really asking me to come in and watch her shower?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his thoughts briefly wandered to Seraph's stunning figure, she suddenly appeared in front of him, her cold voice cutting through his fantasies. "What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony jumped, and at that moment, his mind was filled with images of Seraph's body growing sharp, deadly spikes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her revealing attire, with her breasts partially exposed and her long legs on display, at least she was still dressed, which made Anthony feel somewhat relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearing his throat awkwardly, he stammered, "Uh, I just wanted to talk to you about something."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come in," Seraph said dismissively, already turning back to her desk. She began typing rapidly on the keyboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curious, Anthony asked, "What are you working on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The castle's security system is outdated," she replied without looking up. "I'm upgrading it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony sighed. His Devil Eye could only hack into basic security systems, so he muttered, "Guess I won't be able to see it after all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph glanced at him, raising an eyebrow. "See what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony awkwardly tried to steer his gaze away from her body, managing a nervous smile. "I meant the cameras by the door. If enemies break in, how am I supposed to see them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph rolled her eyes, clearly unimpressed. "I'll set up a terminal in your room so you can monitor it whenever you want. And the firewall I've set up will back up the password for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony couldn't help but laugh. His Devil Eye could hack into beginner-level devices without a password, and with one, he could bypass any level of security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, what did you want to talk about?" Seraph asked, still focused on her computer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need money," Anthony said quickly. "Do you know of any way I can get some?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph paused, then offered, "Tomorrow is the trading day at Dragon Guild. You could try your luck there."</span></p></div>
