        <h1>Chapter 41 Surrender</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony could tell that Jane was testing him. Her alluring demeanor made his heart race with desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slid his hand down the smooth expanse of her thigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, Jane felt a surge of nervousness and considered escaping, but Anthony gripped her soft folds tightly, his voice low and intense. "You're asking too many questions. All I can tell you is that you need to submit to me and serve me loyally. </span><span>One day, when I reach the pinnacle of power, there will be a place for you by my side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't, even if you're not held back, you'll be stuck in this backwater town for the rest of your life, just a branch director.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he inserted his finger into her vagina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought Jane, much like Seraph, appeared naked yet cloaked in a bionic suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He did this to assert his dominance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, Jane suddenly tensed, letting out a groan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Anthony felt the wetness and slipperiness of his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but be stunned momentarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wondered, "Is she teasing me without wearing anything?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How bold!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She really sells me short!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Anthony curled his fingers, beginning to explore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane winced in pain, her expression a mixture of agony and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through her discomfort, she whispered, "Yes. One day, when you reach the pinnacle of power, I will serve you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Johnson, I was wrong. Please forgive me. From now on, I will serve you loyally and do anything for you without hesitation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While she had respected Anthony before, she had also looked down on him. Now, however, she felt a newfound admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he was young and seemingly weak, his ambition to conquer the world and rise to power was something she had never encountered before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Anthony hadn't revealed his true identity, she had pieced it together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the Godfather's heirs had the chance to reach such heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was one of them and receiving training, and she knew she had to align herself with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he became the Godfather, she would reap the rewards and escape the confines of Yoland to experience a broader world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of pride danced in Anthony's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had correctly assessed Jane's ambition; she was determined not to remain in this small town, merely a branch director for life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Jane's pained yet yearning expression, he withdrew his hand and pushed her away with sudden force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane screamed and fell down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing tall like a resolute king, Anthony commanded, "Now, bow and worship me. Show me your loyalty!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He exuded overwhelming confidence and authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's eyes sparkled with excitement; she knew she had finally found the man of her dreams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was someone worth everything she was willing to give in order to follow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quickly bowing, she exclaimed, "Yes, Mr. Johnson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anthony's tone turned icy. "I said, show me your loyalty. I want to see you submit to me completely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was taken aback briefly before she comprehended his intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting her teeth, she tore off her red pajamas, revealing her bare body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Approaching him with respect, she whispered, "I belong to you, heart and soul. Mr. Johnson, please guide me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony found himself swallowing hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every inch of her skin radiated an allure that drew him in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph embodied the allure of sexy and seductive women, while Jane took elegance to a whole new level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he were the old Anthony, he would have succumbed to desire at the sight of such beauty asking for his guidance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, his ambitions overshadowed his momentary cravings; he aimed for greatness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, he had learned to restrain his momentary desires.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suppressing his desires, Anthony said coolly, "Now, tell me everything about the mutant werewolf killer and the Evil Spirit Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Especially who hired them to assassinate Rose."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, Mr. Johnson. Please come with me," Jane replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rising to her feet, she gazed at him with affection and asked, "Would you like me to dress or stay as I am?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Put on your clothes. Cover yourself up!" he urged, feeling distracted by her nakedness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Jane replied with a smile, clearly pleased with her own allure. She waved her hand, and the discarded clothes flew back to her, enveloping her body snugly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Johnson, please come with me now," she said, her tone shifting to seriousness as she turned and walked toward the opposite wall.</span></p></div>
