        <h1>Chapter 163 Aware of Something</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony had suspected for a while that the Evil Spirit Legion was up to something, and after seeing the list, Arthur was sure of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way they'd need all that equipment unless they were planning something major.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What bothered him more was how hastily they'd recruited people like Anne. It was sloppy and too careless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As someone who'd once been a part of the Evil Spirit Legion, Arthur could tell something was off. This wasn't the way they normally operated. It was all very out of character.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since the question was already out there, he didn't hesitate to ask again. "I'm not the sharpest, so please explain it to me a bit more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The messenger didn't waste time with pleasantries and simply replied, "The mining equipment is for, well, mining."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What exactly we're mining, you'll find out when the time comes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the messenger wasn't keen on giving more details, Arthur didn't press. "Got it. Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The messenger gave a quick nod before asking, "What's your name?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur froze for a second but quickly responded, "Aaron Hastings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright. I'll remember you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The messenger looked at him with a bit of approval. "As long as you stay loyal, you'll have a place in Yoland when the time comes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you! I swear I'll stay loyal and follow you till the end."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The messenger gave a small nod and then turned to Anne. "Anne, listen carefully. You've got three days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After that, someone will tell you where to send the equipment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you mess this up, I won't hesitate to eliminate all of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, of course!" Anne didn't waste a second and bowed. "We won't let you down, sir."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the messenger turned to leave. This time, no one dared to ask any more questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as the messenger was about to disappear, he stopped and looked back. "Oh, one more thing. Tomorrow morning, head to the Turner family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their downfall is your chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And just like that, the messenger vanished into the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he was gone, everyone stood there, frozen in shock. They exchanged nervous glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Down the mountain. Be quick..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief pause, Anne's excitement was clear as she waved everyone to follow her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were heading down much faster than they'd gone up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur furrowed his brow, still trying to figure out what the Evil Spirit Legion was up to.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The messenger had said Anthony was finished</span> <span>and the Turner family was doomed, but Arthur knew that wasn't true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the fight in the Turner Manor, Anthony had gotten way stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No ordinary B-level Warriors or Metahumans could stand up to him now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur suspected the Evil Spirit Legion had sent in a C-level </span><span>E</span><span>xpert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>C-level </span><span>E</span><span>xperts were at a whole different level. In all his years with the Legion, Arthur had only ever met one and that was the mysterious informant he'd mentioned before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that informant wouldn't be getting personally involved in this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony had been holed up at the Turner family's compound for a while, and no one could have known he was tracking Anne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Evil Spirit Legion wanted to deal with Anthony, they'd have to go through the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was no way they could break through the Turner family's defenses that fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they hurried down the </span><span>Virstino</span><span> Mountains, Arthur's mind was racing. He couldn't make sense of any of this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't believe the Evil Spirit Legion could take down Anthony, and there was no way they'd get through the Turner family so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they got off the mountain, Arthur quickly arranged for everyone to get in the cars, and he made his way into the lead vehicle, surrounded by his own people, under the excuse of clearing the path ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Johnson, something's off..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he was in, Arthur called Anthony and quickly filled him in on everything that had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Anthony was on his way to Wolf Fang Valley. He'd been trying to get in touch with Arthur but couldn't get through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Either the signal in the mountains was bad, or the Evil Spirit Legion had blocked Wolf Fang Valley's communications.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur's update made Anthony stop in his tracks. He was alarmed but also confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The messenger must've believed he was finished because of </span><span>Necros</span><span>' strength, but Anthony knew the Turner family's defenses were rock solid, and their power had grown immensely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if the Evil Spirit Legion attacked with everything they had, it wouldn't be enough to take them down in the short term.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony couldn't understand why the messenger was so sure the Turner family would fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was starting to think the Evil Spirit Legion had some kind of hidden agenda, and it probably had to do with the ambush they'd set for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even if he was gone, the Turner family still had Carolyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To destroy the Turner family, they'd have to kill her, but Carolyn wasn't likely to leave the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a terrifying thought struck Anthony. His face went pale as he turned and started running down the mountain at full speed, dialing Carolyn's number in a panic. But the call wouldn't go through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He immediately tried calling Rose, but again, there was no answer.</span></p></div>
