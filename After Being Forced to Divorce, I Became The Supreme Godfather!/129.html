        <h1>Chapter 128 The Talk of the Town</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In high society, family banquets were always under intense scrutiny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This Smith family gathering was particularly noteworthy, as it marked their allegiance to the Evil Spirit Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>News of the event spread like wildfire through Yoland, causing a massive uproar. Some were disgusted, condemning the Smiths for collaborating with the enemy and aiding in their evil deeds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others, shamelessly abandoning their integrity, sang the praises of the Smith family and groveled at their feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle with the Turner family had become the talk of the town, with everyone knowing the details.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the Turners had held their ground, the Smiths' propaganda campaign had convinced everyone that the Turner family was finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the Smith family was riding high. With their new connection to the Evil Spirit Legion and half of Yoland's elite families in their pocket, people were practically trampling each other to curry favor with them, even if it meant publicly cutting ties with the Turners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like that, the once-mighty had fallen from grace, becoming social pariahs that everyone avoided like the plague.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony arrived at the Turner Manor from Celestial Palace just in time for dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the meal, he and Rose retired to her chambers for a passionate encounter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only when Rose was trembling and begging for mercy did Anthony finally feel satisfied enough to let his beauty rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's respite, Anthony spoke up. "By the way, I didn't see Aunt Carolyn at dinner. Is she still recovering?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been badly wounded in that battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But three days had passed, and with Rose helping with the healing, even severe injuries should have improved by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, Aunt Carolyn's injury healed a while ago," Rose said, running her fingers through her messy hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She went to meet some people who came back from the Mines this afternoon. Not sure what's keeping her so busy, but she hasn't returned yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"People from the mines?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony froze for a moment before his face darkened. "Don't tell me it's Vincent. The nerve of him to come back so soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose quickly pulled him back and explained, "He went to the Mines to redeem himself, and he won't be back for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, even if he wants to come back, he has to get my and Aunt Carolyn's permission first. If we don't agree, he wouldn't dare to come back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three days earlier, Vincent had murdered his right-hand man, Calvin, to cover his tracks and save his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And later, he volunteered to go to the Mines to, supposedly develop them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though everyone knew Vincent was behind the assassination attempt on Rose, they couldn't prove it now that Calvin was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Vincent was a direct descendant of the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Anthony could ask more, Rose continued with a sigh, "But my dear brother started causing trouble on his very first day there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's been such a pain that the Mines supervisor had no choice but to come back and seek Aunt Carolyn's help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But before they left, he dared to declare that he'd make something of himself at the mines, even without the Turner family's support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He swore he'd never set foot in the Turner household again if he couldn't prove his worth there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony hugged Rose and chuckled, "Isn't that a good thing? Vincent's got a crooked mind. It's better if he stays away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaning against Anthony's shoulder, Rose sighed. "That's easy to say, but the Turner family has invested a lot of manpower and money into developing those mines over the years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Vincent truly wants to change and work for the good of the family, then it's fine. But I'm afraid he's still up to no good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before Grandpa went into seclusion years ago, he insisted that only trustworthy people should develop the Mines. He said there's a huge secret hidden within them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He never specified what exactly, but over these years..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ding!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Rose was speaking, a crisp notification chimed in Anthony's mind: [The Chosen Path quest activated. Find the Leyline.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Find the Leyline?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's whole body tensed up, his eyes narrowing instinctively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mines? Does it have a Leyline?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this in mind, Anthony asked in his mind, "Devil Eye, what is Leyline? Does the Turner family Mines have Leyline?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leyline is a natural ore rich in spiritual energy, also known as Spirit Stone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spirit Stone contains pure spiritual energy, which is of great help to the cultivation and power of Warriors and Metahumans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is uncertain whether the Turner family Mines has Leyline."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Devil Eye's explanation was simple and straightforward, and Anthony was overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spirit Stones contained pure spiritual energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Leylines were formed where countless Spirit Stones converged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In simple terms, Leylines were natural holy grounds for Warriors and Metahumans alike!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Devil Eye's response had been uncertain about whether Leylines existed in the Turner family Mines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when Rose mentioned the Mines, it triggered a quest to find the Leylines. Anthony was now almost sure that there must be Leylines within the Turner family Mines!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to find those Leylines!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Rose rambled on for a while, she noticed Anthony's silence and asked, "What's wrong? What are you thinking about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, nothing..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony smiled and said, "If that's the case, then having Vincent at the Mines really isn't ideal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If there are any earth-shattering secrets in those Mines, he might try to keep them for himself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose nodded at his response, "Aunt Carolyn is worried about that too, but even Vincent doesn't know about the Mines' secrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's something that's been passed down orally between Turner family heads for generations...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh no!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did I just let something slip?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, Rose let out a startled cry and instinctively covered her mouth.</span></p></div>
