        <h1>Chapter 57 A Desperate Ruse</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Calvin invoked family rules and insinuated that Rose was disgracing the Turner family, her anger flared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With flushed cheeks, she shouted, "I've said it before! Anthony isn't a stranger. He's my friend and my savior!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this how the Turner family treats its benefactors?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Repaying kindness with cruelty, losing all conscience, won't that ruin the family's reputation instead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to hold back, Dariel added, "Calvin, Mr. Vincent Turner, Ms. Carolyn Turner herself just confirmed publicly that Anthony saved Ms. Turner's life. He nearly lost his own in the process."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!" Vincent interrupted sharply. "Are you lecturing me? Who do you think you are? Do you even have the right to speak in front of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel flushed red with humiliation, gritting his teeth in silence. Being berated so harshly in front of everyone wounded his pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning back to Rose, Vincent sneered. "There's no such thing as selfless love in this world. Why do you think he saved you? Don't tell me you don't understand his intentions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose bit her lip. "Because we're friends! Because Anthony is loyal and righteous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Loyal and righteous?" Vincent scoffed. "Utter nonsense! He has ulterior motives! He just admitted outside the gate that he approached you for his own gain!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's using your status to pursue some unspeakable agenda!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm convinced now that the assassination attempt was nothing more than a desperate ruse staged by Anthony and the Evil Spirit Legion. It was all an act to paint him as a hero and win your favor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rose, you're too naive! You actually fell for such a clumsy ploy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't believe it!" Rose retorted fiercely. "There's no way Anthony would fake something like that. He nearly died!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin suddenly clapped his forehead as if struck by a realization. "Now I get it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Vincent Turner, your insight is unmatched! Anthony colluded with the Evil Spirit Legion to stage this ruse, all to get close to Ms. Turner! He's nothing but a freeloader who's been cast out and now has his sights set on the Turner family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Vincent Turner, we mustn't let him get away with this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne quickly chimed in, "I can vouch for it! Back when Anthony schemed to marry into our Smith family, he used all kinds of tricks to deceive me. He's useless at everything else but is a master manipulator when it comes to women!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner, don't let him fool you! Open your eyes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd began to murmur in agreement, their voices growing louder, reinforcing the accusations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Public opinion turned sharply against Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Combined with his earlier outburst at the gate, where he admitted his feelings for Rose, it seemed impossible to refute the mounting evidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, under the weight of these accusations, could only manage a bitter smile as he looked at Rose. "Do you trust me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose's gaze remained firm as she nodded. "You risked your life to save me. That's not something you can fake. Even if the whole world doubts you, I'll always stand by your side."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, she once again grasped Anthony's hand tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was enough for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as Rose shared his conviction, Anthony was unafraid of facing anyone or anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Vincent, his expression cold. "Mr. Vincent Turner, all your slander and accusations are just a ploy to get rid of me and obstruct my investigation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't need to defend myself. When I find the real culprit, the truth will come to light on its own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Carolyn Turner has already granted me permission to investigate. Are you sure you want to interfere?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent hesitated under Anthony's piercing gaze, a trace of guilt flashing across his face. He gritted his teeth and said, "I'm only safeguarding the Turner family's honor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that's the case, then I won't hold back! Calvin, seize this troublemaker!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Turner family's matters will be resolved internally, there's no need for an outsider to meddle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin immediately responded, "As you command! Guards!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten men in black uniforms emerged from the shadows. Their expressions were cold, and their presence radiated menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were Vincent's personal guards, an elite force with special authority even Dariel, as the captain of the manor's guards, couldn't control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel raised his voice. "Summon Ms. Carolyn Turner to preside over this matter! She said Anthony could investigate. Does her word still stand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent roared, "How dare you invoke Ms. Carolyn Turner against me! I'll deal with </span><span>you first, you traitor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly drew a sharp dagger and pressed it against Dariel's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose's furious shout rang out. "Vincent, you're going too far! Don't forget, I am the true heir of the family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, as the heir, I command you to put down the knife!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent gritted his teeth. "The family rules are clear. You're not officially the heir until after your twentieth birthday banquet. You don't have that authority yet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As your elder brother, I command you to step aside and stop meddling!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His resolve to eliminate both Dariel and Anthony was evident, even at the cost of disregarding Rose's standing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the critical moment, a deep, commanding voice echoed from a distance. "Causing such a scene in front of all these guests. What a disgrace!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Step back, all of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though calm, the voice carried an undeniable authority, silencing everyone as they instinctively turned toward its source.</span></p></div>
