        <h1>Chapter 54 He Came for Rose</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, that was the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's explanation unraveled the mystery, leaving no doubts in anyone's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her reasoning made perfect sense. It was a logic shared by the elite upper class.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To them, a poor boy and a rich girl were never meant to mix. If, by chance, their worlds collided, drastic measures had to be taken to tear them apart, even if that boy had saved the girl's life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To preserve their so-called dignity, they would go so far as to frame the boy as a criminal, ensuring his removal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It simply was how things were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If any one of them had been in Carolyn's position, they would have done the same without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well said, Ms. Carolyn Turner! Anthony, you're nothing but trash!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Betting your future on experimental drugs? You'll end up with nothing! A lowlife like you will never rise above your station!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A loser like you doesn't deserve to go near Ms. Turner! Even if you died saving her, no one would pity you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of here! You don't even deserve to set foot in Turner Manor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A wretch will never be one of us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted into a cacophony of taunts and jeers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne, who had nearly fallen for Anthony's act, stormed forward in fury. Her slap </span><span>landed hard across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was relieved she hadn't humiliated herself further by begging him to remarry her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, you scum! You almost tricked me into taking you back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can see your true face clearly now! Let me tell you, no matter how hard you try, it's useless for someone like you from the bottom of society! Even if you become stronger and wealthier, I will never remarry you, and I won't even spare you a second glance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Carolyn Turner, a person like this only tarnishes the reputation of Ms. Turner. Now, I request that you kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin quickly joined in, shouting, "That's right! He dared to offend Ms. Turner at Dragon Guild, dragging her name through the mud. He doesn't deserve to live!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd's cries intensified. "Kill him! Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Anthony, who had moments ago commanded admiration as King Tiger, was reduced to a despised prisoner, condemned by all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll take care of this, Ms. Carolyn Turner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, you're using drugs to trigger yourself to beat me! I'm going to chop you down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sergio drew a curved blade made of alloy, gripping it with both hands, his eyes red with fury as he charged forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel's kick sent Sergio sprawling. Kneeling on one knee, he turned to the manor and called out, "Please, Ms. Carolyn Turner, show mercy and spare Anthony! Now, everyone knows that Anthony is not the one who tried to assassinate Ms. Turner. On the contrary, he is Ms. Turner's savior!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we kill him, the Turner family will be scorned as betrayers of kindness. I beg you to reconsider!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's voice returned, as icy as ever. "You're loyal, I'll give you that. But don't worry. Since I've acknowledged his role in saving Rose, I won't kill him. I won't give anyone that satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, I know your kind. You've always relied on women for your survival. Now that you've been cast aside, you've set your sights on Rose. Let me be clear: forget it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rose is beyond your reach. You can't afford what it takes to be part of the Turner family. Because at the end of the day, you're nothing but trash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't kill you. Leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Carolyn's words faded, the suffocating pressure around Anthony lifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally exhaled, his lungs relieved of the crushing weight. But his eyes burned with unshed tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From beginning to end, the lofty Carolyn never appeared in person, but her cold words made Anthony feel an immense sense of humiliation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was even more humiliating than when he saw his wife Anne cheating with Alvin and being thrown out by her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of intense resentment drove him to act impulsively!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting his teeth, he straightened his back, and his gaze fixed unwaveringly on Turner Manor gates. His voice rang out with unshakable resolve. "Since you already know the truth, let me spell it out for you. I came here today for Rose!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll win her over. She'll be my woman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you!" A furious roar echoed from within the estate. The ground beneath Anthony trembled as loose soil swirled upward, forming a massive earthen shield that hovered above his head, threatening to crush him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weight bore down, and Anthony's legs nearly buckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he held his ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if his bones shattered under the strain, he would stand and finish what he had to say!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Straightening with all his might, he shouted, "Even if you kill me, I'll say this! Rose is the woman I saved with my own life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I promised her I'd come to her banquet today. I vowed to help her uncover the real culprit!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You may know the killer belongs to the Evil Spirit Legion, but do you know who hired them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Until the mastermind is exposed, Rose will remain in constant danger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Old witch. Here's the truth. Only I can find the real killer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he forced out the last word, blood spilled from his mouth once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel's heart sank into despair. He was convinced this was the end for Anthony. Defying Carolyn so openly and calling her an old witch? That was a death sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he dared to plead for Anthony again, Carolyn might kill him too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, Carolyn's fury erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've already promised to spare your life. But you're nothing but a worthless life, daring to offend the honor of the Turner family again. If you seek your own death, don't blame me! I'll kill you right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The yellow shield above Anthony's head spun violently, transforming into a massive yellow blade that plummeted toward him with lethal intent.</span></p></div>
