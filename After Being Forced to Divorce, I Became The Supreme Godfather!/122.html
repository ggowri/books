        <h1>Chapter 121 Thirteen Guardians</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose exclaimed flushed, with a hint of reluctance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony could see that she was still unsatisfied. As a woman, she was more reserved after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony flipped over and pounced on Rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Rose's desire grew, Anthony secretly practiced the dual cultivation technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the bedroom, there was an endless moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose's body radiated with a faint mist as if her superpower had been involuntarily triggered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be self-repair?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony couldn't be sure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he did know was that their dual cultivation technique had noticeably enhanced his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, they fell asleep, exhausted. While Rose slumbered deeply, Anthony sat cross-legged on the bed, practicing the Energy-absorbing Breathing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, by the time Rose awoke, the sun was already high in the sky, and Anthony had long since left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Early that morning, he'd received a call from Seraph. Arthur had arrived for his briefing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the grand hall of the Celestial Palace, Arthur stood in formation with a group of people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony approached with long strides, and Arthur hurried forward to greet him with reverence. "Mr. Johnson," Arthur said respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony scanned the group. Counting them, his brows furrowed. "Only twelve people?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur nodded hastily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, but rest assured, each one is worth ten ordinary experts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They all have unparalleled skills. Small in number, but their power is extraordinary."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's skeptical gaze swept over the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The twelve individuals varied greatly in appearance. Some were towering and muscular, while others, including a few women, seemed almost frail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on, Mr. Johnson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing Anthony's doubt, Arthur didn't explain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he turned to a burly man in the group and gestured. "Angus, show him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man named Angus stepped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a shake of his body, the muscles in his arms swelled to an unnatural size.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with a thunderous punch, he struck the stone floor beneath them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The floor, crafted from reinforced granite, was meant to be unyielding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground shattered instantly, fractures spreading several feet outward from Angus' fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His massive hand was embedded deep within the stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur seized the moment to explain. "Mr. Johnson, Angus is naturally gifted with immense strength and is a Level A physical metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His punches carry the force of a thousand pounds!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony nodded in approval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impressive. Who else here is a metahuman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Arthur could answer, a hulking man with a wild mane and a thick beard stepped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Broad-shouldered and towering, with a face covered in a thick beard and a mane of unkempt hair, he looked every bit like a wandering vagabond at first glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man let out the roar of a lion that shook the air, his body radiating an animalistic energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a beast-type metahuman&mdash;a lion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good. Anyone else?" Anthony remarked, hands in his pockets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A slender woman stepped out next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She waved her hands, and the once-calm courtyard was suddenly swept by a fierce gale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wind, carrying fine grains of sand, surged toward an ornamental tree, reducing its leaves and branches to fragments in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony maintained a calm expression but was secretly delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur hadn't exaggerated&mdash;each of these individuals truly possessed exceptional abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of the twelve, five were metahumans, all Level A.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest were Warriors, each with their own unique talents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them was a seemingly harmless woman, but Arthur explained that she was an expert in mechanical traps and concealed weapons, capable of killing without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another was a quiet sharpshooter with a long rifle strapped to her back&mdash;an expert marksman who never missed her target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a thorough evaluation, Anthony was satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He released the group from the soul contract they'd been forced into by the Evil Spirit Legion and replaced it with his own pact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of them had no real names, only nicknames or code names given by the Evil Spirit Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony didn't care for that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since there are exactly twelve of you, from now on, you'll be named after the Zodiac.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are the founding members of the Draconic Shield and my most trusted team. Understood?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Johnson!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for bestowing us with names!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Freed from their previous soul contracts, the group visibly relaxed and expressed genuine respect for Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur hesitated, then asked, "Mr. Johnson, what about me?"</span></p></div>
