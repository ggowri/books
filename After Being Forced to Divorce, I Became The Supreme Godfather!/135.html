        <h1>Chapter 134 Deal with It Personally</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony had initially planned to attend the family dinner alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the Turner family was uneasy, and Carolyn herself insisted that Dariel accompany him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Left with no choice, he brought Dariel along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These days, though, Dariel had nothing but admiration and respect for Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel was a naturally awakened Metahuman, but he had been stuck between Level A and Level B for years. He had tried countless times to break through but could never quite grasp the threshold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three days ago, Anthony had immediately spotted his predicament and personally helped him advance from Level A to Level B Metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap between ranks shouldn't be underestimated! The difference in power was like heaven and earth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony? That punk actually dared to show up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! Like he had a choice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This worthless piece of trash crossed the Evil Spirit Legion! He's a dead man walking, no matter where he runs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's dead either way, might as well crawl over and beg for mercy. If Mr. Foster's in a good mood, he might spare his life..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony had become something of a celebrity in Yoland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, he crashed Anne and Alvin's engagement party, then caused chaos at the Dragon Guild auction, followed by the showdown at the Turner Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His name had become infamous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, everyone also knew this guy was doomed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had offended the Evil Spirit Legion, and today, the Evil Spirit Legion was formally accepting the families of Yoland into its fold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was a helpless nobody, a live-husband kicked out of his wife's home, who had only gained a bit of strength through drugs. What could he possibly use to resist the Evil Spirit Legion?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, seeing Anthony arrive, many naturally assumed he had come to grovel and beg for forgiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet despite these thoughts, the crowd instinctively parted to create a path as Anthony strolled casually toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop right there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to enter, a burly man in black blocked his way, sneering, "A </span><span>worthless rubbish who got kicked out thinks he can walk through the Smith Manor's door?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Timothy, the Smith family's deputy head of security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony wasn't surprised at all. He calmly stopped and said, "Anne begged me repeatedly to come here. Now that I'm here, you won't let me in? Should I leave then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bullshit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy exploded in fury, roaring, "Our young lady, oh no, our head of the family, beg you? Did a donkey kick you in the head?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy showed no respect whatsoever towards Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, Anthony had infiltrated the Smith family to retrieve the Dragon Ring but was unfortunately caught by Scarlet, Anne's stepmother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd meant to teach her a lesson, but surprisingly, the woman turned out to be a masochist. The more he roughed her up, the more excited she got until she started coming onto him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony figured he might as well go all the way and fuck her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The problem was that their noisy encounter caught the attention of Timothy, who was on guard duty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony had given him a savage beating afterward. It was something Timothy hadn't forgotten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he had the chance, how could Timothy possibly let Anthony off easy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh," Anthony chuckled, stepping forward to whisper, "Not only did she beg me to come to this family dinner, but she also threw herself at me earlier, crying and pleading for me to sleep with her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You son of a bitch! You're fucking dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy froze for a moment before his eyes blazed with fury. He swung his fist at Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>WHAM!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately for him, before his fist could connect, Dariel, who had been silent until this point, sent him flying with a single kick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel was now a genuine Level B Metahuman, possessing considerable strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy, a mere deputy captain, wasn't even a Warrior. At best, he was just a security guard with some fighting skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare he curse at Mr. Johnson?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After kicking him away, Dariel spat on the ground and snarled, "What kind of lowlife dares to disrespect Mr. Johnson?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Holy shit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? Anthony's starting fights?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Has this kid lost his mind? Doesn't he know this is the Smith family's territory?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Picking a fight with the Smith family here... he must have a death wish..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted in shocked whispers and exclamations as Dariel's kick connected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Anthony wasn't directly responsible, Dariel was his man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted into noisy chatter as the Smith family's security guards swarmed in, </span><span>cracking their knuckles with menacing looks on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a bunch of losers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel's eyes darkened as he automatically dropped into a fighting stance, not waiting for Anthony's command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Anthony waved him off. "Just enjoy the show. Let me handle this one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How many years of mockery and humiliation had Anthony endured since marrying into the Smith family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recognized every single face in that crowd, and each one had taken their turn bullying him over the years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why he wanted to deal with this personally!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his response, Dariel was momentarily taken aback, then he understood and, retracting his fist, silently stepped back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had absolute faith in Anthony's abilities. It wasn't just these dozens or so men; even a hundred of this caliber wouldn't be a match for Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you! Kneel down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before Anthony could make a move, Anne's furious voice rang out from the courtyard.</span></p></div>
