        <h1>Chapter 23 Anne's Scheme</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare Anthony, that useless fool, embrace Rose in front of us? This is an insult, a direct provocation to every man in Yoland! He can't be allowed to get away with this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin clenched his fists, his eyes bloodshot with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose was the perfect goddess in the hearts of every man in Yoland, the ideal dream lover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of them even had the chance to approach her, let alone touch her. The thought alone was unthinkable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But today, they had watched as Anthony embraced Rose, and the anger that swelled within them was beyond words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Alvin spoke, the others also clenched their fists and began cursing. They were so furious that they almost wanted to tear Anthony apart, piece by piece.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know Anthony. Besides using sweet words to please women, he's good for nothing. Ms. Turner is too naive; that's why she's been fooled by him. We need to find a way to separate her from Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Ms. Turner continues to protect him, no matter whether Anthony stays in Dragon Guild or not, it'll be impossible for us to claim the 100 million dollars of bounty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's tone was serious, and her words carried a weight that resonated with the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was hard for her to accept that the man she had once abandoned had actually gained Rose's favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words made everyone think of the massive bounty on Anthony's head, and their anger intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose had to be separated from Anthony!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anne, you know Anthony best. Do you have any ideas?" Alvin asked in a low, urgent voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne thought for a moment before sneering. "I have a plan, but it will require everyone's cooperation. As we all know, the Turner family is a medical family, and Ms. Turner is known as a miracle-working doctor. She comes to Dragon Guild every month, hoping to acquire valuable medicinal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tomorrow, Anthony will certainly accompany Ms. Turner to the auction, and that's </span><span>when we can make our move during the herb auction..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She whispered her plan to the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others, hearing it, agreed that it was a brilliant idea and promised to cooperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anne, time is of the essence. Go find Anthony now! We need to hook him!" Alvin urged impatiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry! I know Anthony's weaknesses. I won't fail!" Anne said confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, she carefully dressed herself in a low-cut gown and, under the cover of night, made her way to Rose's villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She told the Dragon Guard at the door that she was Anthony's ex-wife and needed to speak to him urgently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dragon Guards, who were familiar with Jane's instructions, treated Anthony like a VIP, so they didn't dare neglect her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They quickly went inside to notify Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony frowned when he heard the news. He wondered what Anne wanted so late at night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Is it something to do with Rose?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony! How are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Anne saw Anthony, she immediately rushed over, her face lighting up with joy as she took his arm. Her eyes gleamed with the eager look of a young woman meeting her lover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She deliberately shifted her body, flaunting her ample cleavage before Anthony's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony thought, "This woman really knows how to act!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Anthony hadn't seen through her fa&ccedil;ade, he might have fallen for it again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cut the act, Anne. Get to the point."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony snorted coldly and shook off Anne's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne looked hurt. "I know you're angry with me. I don't blame you; it's my fault. I let you down. You were so good to me, but I was deceived by Alvin and ended up doing the wrong things..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lowered her head, her face filled with guilt, and her eyes even glistened with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a master of drama!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony impatiently cut her off. "It's too late to talk about that now. If you don't have anything important to say, then let me sleep."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait!" Anne quickly grabbed his arm, pleading. "I really need to talk to you. Let's go to that cabin over there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a small, cozy cabin on the lawn nearby, a temporary resting place for the guild's members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since they were in the Dragon Guild, no one dared to hurt him. Anthony was curious about what trick Anne was trying to pull, so he followed her to the cabin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the door was closed, the surroundings fell silent. The air was fragrant with the scent of flowers, and moonlight streamed in through the windows, casting a dim glow on the room. Anne gazed at Anthony with eyes full of longing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony couldn't help but swallow. To be honest, Anne's beauty and charm couldn't </span><span>compare to Rose's, but she was still considered one of the top beauties in Yoland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her chest on full display under the moonlight, it was hard to ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At one point, Anthony had been drawn to her beauty and seemingly innocent nature, which was why he had willingly spent three years on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, everything had been different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's old tricks couldn't fool him anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Anthony remained unmoved, Anne's eyes flickered with disappointment. She spoke in a softer tone, "Anthony, is it really over for us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony answered coldly, "We're from different worlds now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne thought Anthony was just repeating her old words to get back at her, thinking it was a form of pettiness. But what she didn't know was that Anthony had already seen a much broader world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old Anne was someone he could never reach, and the current Anne seemed like nothing more than an insignificant insect in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were no longer from the same world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine." Anne sighed. "You can't neglect our past. We were married for three years, so even if we ended up parted, we still have a relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I'm asking you for one thing. Could you speak a few good words for me in front of Ms. Turner? Please ask the Turner family give the Smith family a chance to cooperate. Would you do that?"</span></p></div>
