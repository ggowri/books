        <h1>Chapter 105 One-On-One</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, we'll fight one-on-one," Anthony said, quickly holstering his Inferno Gatling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Warriors, I admire your bravery and fearlessness! I can't stand by and watch you die in vain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He descended from the ruins and strode towards Mason. "Speak up. How do you want to fight me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold it right there! No tricks!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason, who had been outmaneuvered before, became cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony chuckled dryly, spreading his hands. "Are you really the leader? So timid?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My people are in your hands; what trick could I possibly play?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not afraid to fight me one-on-one, are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason's anger flared, and he cursed, "Bullshit! Are you kidding me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of consideration, he said, "North of the Turner Manor is Phantom Hollow. We'll fight there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you win, I'll spare the Turner family. If you lose, I'll make the entire Turner family bury you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony frowned. "You're planning to deal with them after luring me away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason snorted disdainfully, "So what if I am? Do you have a choice?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was this a plot by Mason?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony thought it over. If Mason left, the rest of the werewolves might not be able to handle the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Anthony was not afraid of Mason at all. Killing him would be as easy as pie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as Mason said, Anthony had no choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lead the way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Anthony could hesitate, Mason, holding a dozen people hostage, gestured for Anthony to go first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Johnson! Be careful not to fall for his trap!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Phantom Hollow is dark and treacherous. What if there's an ambush?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Anthony was really going, Carolyn, Jane, and Dariel were all alarmed and rushed over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rest easy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony smiled, "In the face of absolute power, all schemes and tricks are futile."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was confident, but Jane and the others were puzzled and worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason laughed scornfully. "Don't be too confident. Anthony, do you really think you're a match for me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone was just hiding out of fear. You coward, still daring to talk big?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony glanced at him, not saying much. He walked towards Phantom Hollow with his head held high and chest out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason cursed, "Brazen bluff! This time, I will make sure you die a miserable death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hand, and a dozen Turner family guards surrounded Anthony as they headed to Phantom Hollow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony left, and so did Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief, but they were still worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were still a large number of werewolves lurking in the ruins, watching and waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family had suffered heavy losses. If the werewolf army attacked at this moment, how could they resist?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the werewolf army seemed to have no intention of making a move. They seemed to be waiting for the outcome of the one-on-one between Anthony and Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After letting out a sigh of relief, Jane asked Carolyn curiously, "Ms. Carolyn Turner, what kind of elixir did Ms. Rose Turner give him? Why did Mr. Johnson recover so quickly? And he seems even stronger now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be precise, he was incredibly mighty, like a god of war.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony had already left, but his towering and muscular figure was still etched in Jane's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Carolyn also seemed to be in a daze, lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner?" Seeing she didn't speak, Jane asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn snapped back to reality and smiled, "I'm not quite sure. We'll find out when we see Ms. Rose Turner later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was smart enough to see that Carolyn didn't want to talk about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that case, the Turner family must have some kind of elixir or secret weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But whatever it was, it was a secret of the Turner family. They wouldn't quickly reveal it to outsiders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this thought, Jane didn't ask any further and hurried to regain her strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nobody knew if there would be another fierce battle ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment later, a faint rumble came from the northern Phantom Hollow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had begun!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was shocked and looked up subconsciously, seeing clouds of dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a significant movement. The Turner family couldn't help but worry again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, a burst of laughter came from outside the main gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Anne walked in first, sneering, "One-on-one? Anthony, that fool, is just asking for death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He, an insignificant guy, relies on the Turner family's healing power and big guns. Does he really dare to fight Mr. Foster one-on-one? I think he's tired of living. Pathetic, ignorant fool."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin also walked in, disdainfully saying, "He and Mr. Foster went to Phantom Hollow because they don't want to die so undignified, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin looked at Carolyn with a smug expression. "Carolyn, at this point, are you still stubborn?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For a nobody, you've caused the Turner family to suffer heavy casualties. Is it worth it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I suggest you join Mr. Foster sooner to avoid the extinction of the Turner family. What do you think?"</span></p></div>
