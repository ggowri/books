        <h1>Chapter 165 No Turning Back</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's blood boiled as a familiar laugh echoed from the cliff above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A rope dropped, and a man in black quickly descended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, ropes appeared on both sides, each with a figure in black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were at least thirty men. Carolyn's eyes narrowed, and she instinctively stepped back, putting herself between Rose and the looming threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't scared, but she needed to stay sharp. A few steps back </span><span>was</span><span> the only way to maintain control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the edge of the cliff was right behind her, and her retreat was blocked by a railing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vincent?" Rose froze, staring in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why is it you? What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the front of the group stood none other than Vincent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose, still naive and trusting, hadn't yet caught on to the danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent laughed heartily, landing smoothly on the ground. "Rose, you're really too cute for your own good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? Well, I'm here to take you back. You believe me, don't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose's face shifted from confusion to shock. "You..." she began, then faltered as the truth hit her. "Vincent, what are you planning to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>My plan</span><span>?" Vincent's grin vanished, replaced by a cold, dangerous smile. "I'm here to take back what's mine. And that means... killing you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!" Carolyn's voice cut through the tension like a knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vincent, don't push it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Last time, I let you go because </span><span>you're</span><span> part of the Turner family. But don't think I'll be so lenient now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cross me, and I'll use the family's laws to throw you out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Carolyn was already scanning the situation, calculating her next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn wasn't fazed by the thirty or so men closing in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd known Vincent's true nature for a long time, and nothing about his actions surprised her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, when Vincent and Rose had clashed, Carolyn, as the leader of the Turner family, had chosen to turn a blind eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She understood that some competition could be a valuable lesson for Rose. As long as the larger picture wasn't in danger, there was no need to step in too heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, Carolyn had always trusted that, as long as she was around, Vincent wouldn't be able to cause too much trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was until Rose was nearly killed in a werewolf assassination. Afterward, Anthony had gathered evidence that pointed directly at Vincent, enough to make it all but certain he was behind the attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, Vincent had killed Calvin in front of </span><span>her</span><span>, silencing him before he could expose the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, even though the pieces were falling into place, Carolyn </span><span>still </span><span>couldn't make a move without solid proof.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite everything, Vincent remained a member of the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> it was a good choice to exile him to the Mines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she never thought he'd snap this fast, going full psycho and launching an outright rebellion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent's laughter rang out again, sharp and derisive. "Expel me from the family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think </span><span>we are at home now</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think I'</span><span>d</span><span> fear you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know me well enough. I </span><span>won</span><span>'t make a move unless I'm fully prepared."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, more than thirty men closed in from all sides, trapping Carolyn and Rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent stood tall among them, an air of complete confidence surrounding him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vincent!" Carolyn's face grew cold, her tone firm as she called out to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a point of no return. </span><span>You really want</span><span> to go down this path?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You still have a chance to stop this. If you back off now, I'll pretend none of this ever happened."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Cut the act</span><span>, Carolyn!" Vincent </span><span>spat</span><span> bitterly, his voice seething with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've pushed me into this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've spent your entire life protecting the Turner family, never marrying, and I actually respect that about you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what about her?" He pointed accusingly at Rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She hasn't even taken control yet, and she's already entangled with that shady Anthony."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why should our family's fate be tied to an outsider?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And the empire that the Turner family has built over generations. Why should it fall into the hands of someone like him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes burned with loathing as they fixed on Rose, the hatred in them barely concealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No," Carolyn replied, her voice unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're wrong. I never planned to hand over the Turner family to anyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rose is part of the family, and she is the most gifted individual the Turner family has seen in centuries."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! Talented, sure," Vincent sneered, cutting her off with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But </span><span>so</span><span> what? You really think that soft-hearted Rose has what it takes to lead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Handing the Turner family over to her is the same as handing it over to Anthony, isn't it?"</span></p></div>
