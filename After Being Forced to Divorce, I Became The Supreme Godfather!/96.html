        <h1>Chapter 95 Love</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason advanced step by step, the werewolf army following close behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony stood firm, determination burning in his eyes like a hawk's gaze, fixed intently on Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood dripped steadily from his hand, flowing down the edge of Dragonfang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Johnson, you're too badly injured..." The Turner Guards' squad leader hesitated, </span><span>his knife drawn as he approached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without turning, Anthony waved him off with a sharp gesture. "Get back! If I can't handle Mason, you must take Ms. Turner and get her to safety. Protect her at all costs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go back!" Anthony's voice cut through the tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The squad leader gritted his teeth but reluctantly stepped back. "Yes, sir."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that if Anthony couldn't defeat Mason, throwing himself into the fight would only be a meaningless sacrifice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason's cold voice broke the silence. "You really think you can take me down, brat?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony spat out blood but didn't respond. His grip on Dragonfang, however, was all the answer Mason needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason sneered. "Don't worry, you won't die alone. Rose and the entire Turner family will die with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Mason suddenly charged forward. A black whirlwind, his speed was terrifying&mdash;a blur of motion like a bolt of lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's left eye glowed faintly with blue light as Dragonfang trembled in his hand. His blood surged, but the sheer force of Mason's attack sent him flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact shattered the already damaged floor into rubble, sending dust billowing into the air. Anthony crashed to the ground, powerless against Mason's overwhelming strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Anthony!" Rose screamed, tears streaming down her face as she ran toward him without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood trickled from Anthony's mouth as he struggled to speak. "Take Ms. Turner to the safe house. Now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose shook her head, clutching him tightly. "No! Anthony, we'll go together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop being foolish!" Anthony pushed her away, his voice harsh. "I'm too injured. If you stay, you'll die with me. Go now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose's healing power was remarkable, but Anthony knew his wounds were too severe. Worse, Rose had already exhausted much of her energy earlier. If she tried to heal him again, it could cost her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" Rose's voice was firm, her gaze unwavering despite her tears. "If you're not going, I'm not going either. I promised I'd live and die with you. If this is the end, I'd rather face it with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony tried to dodge her hands, but Rose pressed forward, her frail body glowing with healing energy. In that moment, her deep love for him shone through, fearless and resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's heart trembled. He turned to look at her, moved beyond words by the depth of her affection. But that same love tore at him, filling him with a sense of helplessness. He lacked the strength to protect the woman who cared for him so deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Johnson! The Turner family can't hold out much longer. We have to go now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice came from a woman staggering toward them, blood streaking her face. Anthony turned to see Jane, followed by a dozen injured guards. Their disheveled </span><span>state spoke volumes&mdash;the West Gate had fallen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jane..." Anthony muttered, shocked. How many troops had the Evil Spirit Legion sent? Why such a large-scale attack? This couldn't just be about him and Rose. Something bigger was at play.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane grabbed Anthony's arm. "No time to waste. Come on, I'll get you out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony hesitated, but Jane didn't wait. She pulled him along, urgency in her every movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Jane, the survival of the Turner family was irrelevant. Her only concern was Anthony&mdash;the heir of the Godfather Group. If Anthony died here, it would bring disastrous consequences for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! I can't leave!" Anthony's voice broke through his shock, a spark of hope igniting in his eyes. "I have a plan..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could finish, blood gushed from his mouth. His body gave out, and he collapsed, unconscious.</span></p></div>
