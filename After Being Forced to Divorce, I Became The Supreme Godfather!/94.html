        <h1>Chapter 93 Recover</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vast Turner Manor was engulfed in flames of battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, sharp and piercing howls of wolves echoed, sending chills down one's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attack by the Evil Spirit Legion came suddenly; it seemed they were after Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, such a large-scale siege clearly indicated that it was premeditated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Evil Spirit Legion was a notorious and secretive assassination organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this assault on the Turner Manor involved no fewer than three hundred werewolves, causing a tremendous commotion with numerous casualties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't make sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the East Gate, the werewolves overran the first checkpoint, rendering the hail of bullets completely ineffective.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second checkpoint was somewhat narrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than thirty members of the Turner Guards stood their ground, forming a wall of flesh and blood as solid as steel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the werewolves were extremely fierce and unstoppable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After one charge, a third of the Turner Guards members fell!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner, we can't wait any longer. Please go now..." Not far away, Helen cried out, urgently urging Rose to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the critical moment when lives were at stake, Rose remained surprisingly calm, tightly embracing Anthony and interlocking her fingers with his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fine layer of sweat appeared on her smooth forehead. Rose held Anthony tightly in her arms, refusing to let him go no matter how much Helen urged her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Anthony's pale face regained some color, and he looked much better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intense battle startled Anthony, who slowly opened his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony..." Rose was pleasantly surprised, her sad eyes welling up with uncontrollable excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony coughed lightly and then shook his head, saying, "I'm fine. Stop using your superpower."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was more aware than anyone of the severity of his injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's why he was also very clear that his rapid recovery in such a short time was due to Rose, more precisely, because of Rose's healing power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in such a short time, Rose's relentless efforts to heal him also took a huge toll on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To put it mildly, the toll on Rose was no different from engaging in a desperate fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beads of sweat on her forehead and her slightly pale complexion were enough to prove this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, without waiting for Rose to release her grip, Anthony pulled his hands away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony! Rose!" Seeing their closeness, Anne couldn't help but feel enraged and shouted, "You're disgusting! With so many troops, the Turner family is almost destroyed, and you still have the nerve to be affectionate here, truly shameless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, the man she had despised for three years, a good-for-nothing loser, was now cherished by Rose, who was even willing to risk her life to protect him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne felt extremely displeased. In her mind, Anthony should be despised and trampled upon by everyone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Anthony's downfall could highlight how wise her decision had been at the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose's current actions were tantamount to doubting her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose ignored Anne's taunts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony took his hand back, which startled her. She said urgently, "Anthony, you're badly hurt..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish speaking, a terrifying wave of air came from not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Accompanied by a deafening roar, she turned her head to see the second checkpoint explode violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turner Guards were defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A piece of marble that had been blasted away flew towards Rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch out!" Anthony shouted in alarm, suddenly standing up and delivering a powerful punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thick and large piece of marble was instantly shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You protect Ms. Turner! The rest of you, follow me to counterattack!" After smashing the marble with one punch, Anthony regained his confidence. After giving </span><span>the order, he charged out first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Counterattack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's renewed vigor also greatly boosted the morale of the Turner Guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving a squad to protect Rose, nearly forty to fifty people roared as they charged forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything in the Turner family revolved around Rose, so the core mission of the Turner Guards was to protect her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, with the main gate about to be breached and the werewolf army poised to destroy the Turner family, they had no choice but to charge into battle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Anthony, an outsider, could risk his life for the Turner family; they certainly couldn't stand idly by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony rushed over. Everyone originally thought he was going to engage the werewolves in hand-to-hand combat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he raised an M9 submachine gun in each hand and pulled the triggers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the bullets were not powerful enough to kill the werewolves, they were sufficient to force the ones that had rushed in to retreat in the shortest time possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second checkpoint was narrow to begin with, and fewer than ten werewolves had rushed in. Under the intense firepower, they had no choice but to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The effect of using the submachine guns was excellent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After emptying a clip in one breath, Anthony charged forward with the Dragonfang in hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A clip contained one hundred rounds, and each round was worth 10 gold coins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony emptied two clips of ammunition. Although he could buy bullets at a very cheap price from Dragon Ring Store, it still cost him two thousand gold coins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two thousand gold coins vanished in several minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had to buy bullets from the black market, it would cost him two hundred thousand gold coins!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This level of expenditure was something even a prominent family like the Turner family couldn't afford.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at this point, Anthony didn't care about these things; as long as he could drive back the werewolves, any cost was worth it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason, standing outside the gate, couldn't help but widen his eyes in shock at the energetic Anthony, wondering if he had an indestructible body.</span></p></div>
