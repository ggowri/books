        <h1>Chapter 160 Necros Escaped</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony could tell that </span><span>Necros</span><span> had a significant position in the Evil Spirit Legion, probably even higher than Arthur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That meant </span><span>Necros</span><span> knew a lot more about the Legion, and that was exactly the information Anthony was after.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn you!" </span><span>Necros</span><span> growled, spinning around with an expression full of fury and disdain. "A low-life like you </span><span>thinks</span><span> you can make me surrender? Keep dreaming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to the hell!" With a savage roar, he wrenched a tree, thick as a man's waist, from the ground and hurled it at Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tree flew through the dark sky, cutting a clean arc as it rocketed toward Anthony with incredible speed and power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with the Inferno Gatling in his hands, this was child's play.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony unloaded a barrage of bullets, and the tree exploded into splinters, falling apart in midair like shattered glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as the tree disintegrated, Anthony's instincts screamed. He couldn't see </span><span>Necros</span><span> anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could react, he heard the unmistakable sound of something large cutting through the air, a sharp, whistling whoosh from the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without thinking, Anthony turned, and a massive fist flew straight at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way to dodge it in time, not even with the Inferno Gatling in his hands. The punch was too fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With no choice, Anthony dove out of the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fist missed by inches, the rush of wind from it almost knocking him off his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart raced. Recovering quickly, Anthony lifted the Inferno Gatling again, unleashing another rapid-fire barrage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Fuck you</span><span>!" </span><span>Necros</span><span>' roar was full of rage and frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stopped fighting, realizing he'd lost his edge. Without hesitation, he turned and sprinted toward the forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The punch he'd thrown had been a last-ditch effort, fueled by all his remaining strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Missing it meant he had no more tricks left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he didn't run now, Anthony would grind him down until there was nothing left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As </span><span>Necros</span><span> started to flee, Anthony couldn't help but laugh. Gripping the Inferno Gatling, he chased after him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel </span><span>Necros</span><span>' power fading fast. His transformation wasn't going to last much longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony wouldn't let him slip away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Anthony pursued </span><span>Necros</span><span>, he noticed his opponent gradually returning to his normal size, his speed slowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, his steps grew unsteady, as though his escape was no longer as effortless as before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony swiftly put away his Inferno Gatling and took off after him, moving like a shadow, closing the gap with incredible speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he was about to catch up, </span><span>Necros</span><span> suddenly morphed into a shadow and vanished in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, almost upon him, was left frozen in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Necros</span><span> was no ordinary foe. His abilities were unpredictable and powerful, always keeping Anthony on edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to admit, this was someone who truly wasn't to be underestimated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What caught his attention, though, was the mention of </span><span>Archlord</span><span> </span><span>Iscairn</span><span>, which only deepened his curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolf assassin, XN-601, had said he came from Southwest Camp in the </span><span>Virstino</span><span> Mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony remembered that even Arthur was tied to that base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, it seemed like the attack on the Turner family and everything that followed had been orchestrated from there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That made Anthony </span><span>wonder</span><span> if </span><span>Archlord</span><span> </span><span>Iscairn</span><span> could be the leader of that Southwest Camp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If so, he was getting closer than ever to uncovering the Evil Spirit Legion's plot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Capturing </span><span>Necros</span><span> or tracking down the person behind him would be the key to exposing everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now </span><span>Necros</span><span> had gotten away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, the fact that someone of his caliber had been dispatched confirmed just how serious the Evil Spirit Legion's intentions were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wouldn't send someone that powerful unless the stakes were incredibly high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony couldn't help but wonder what exactly drew the Evil Spirit Legion to a small town like Yoland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family's arcane tonics didn't seem like nearly enough to attract their attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart skipped a beat at the thought of the </span><span>Leyline</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Leyline</span><span> was linked to the third task of the Chosen Path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But so far, there was no concrete evidence that the Turner family's Mines had any.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Evil Spirit Legion was after the </span><span>Leyline</span><span>, everything he suspected could be true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustrated and confused, Anthony took a deep breath and swallowed the blood that had gathered in his mouth from the intense battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fight had taken a heavy toll on him. The effort it took to maintain his Dragon Avatar and wield the power of his Devil Eye had completely drained him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was no time to waste. After catching his breath, he dialed Arthur's number only to find it didn't go through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony had already done his homework on Wolf Fang Valley's location, so without hesitation, he set off toward it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wolf Fang Valley was just one of many canyons in the </span><span>Virstino</span><span> Mountains, a dark and eerie place with towering trees and overgrown vines. The flowers were as tall as a </span><span>man, and thick vines snaked up the cliffs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the distance, a cluster of lights quickly approached, growing brighter as they drew nearer to the valley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On a massive stone in the heart of the valley, a Black Cloak stood with his hands behind his back, calmly watching the approaching lights.</span></p></div>
