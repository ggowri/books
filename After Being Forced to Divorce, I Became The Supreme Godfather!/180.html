        <h1>Chapter 179 Terrifying Power</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle at Crimson Canyon erupted with a thunderous crash, shaking the entire area!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their fight was absolute chaos. The sound of their blows echoed through the canyon, deafening even through the screen. Sand and rocks flew everywhere as they clashed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle raged across every inch of terrain. They started on the road, then moved to the cliffs, down into the valley, and back to the highway again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once-smooth pavement was now completely destroyed, riddled with craters and debris.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This Aaron's got some serious skills," Vincent remarked, arms crossed as he watched from the hidden chamber. He was clearly impressed with Aaron's performance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By Vincent's calculations, it would take no more than thirty more exchanges to finish Anthony off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, Anthony's strength was terrifying in its own right, but neither Vincent nor Anne gave that fact much thought right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They only cared about one thing&mdash;Anthony was about to die, with no doubt about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another explosive impact rang out as Aaron's fist slammed Anthony into the cliff face, sending clouds of dust billowing into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The solid rock wall cracked and splintered from the force of the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh!" Anthony's body shuddered as blood sprayed from his mouth, his face turning ghostly pale in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hah!" Vincent threw his head back with a maniacal laugh. "Are you watching this, </span><span>Rose</span><span>? Ms. Carolyn Turner?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony's about to die, and trust me, it's </span><span>gonna</span><span> be slow and painful. I'll make you watch as we slice his head off, inch by inch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Anthony!" Rose burst into tears, gripping the iron chains until her knuckles turned white, veins popping on her hands as tears streamed down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next cell, Carolyn couldn't bear to watch anymore. She squeezed her eyes shut, consumed by guilt that felt like it was eating her alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God, how she regretted everything!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only she'd listened to Anthony's warnings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hatred burned inside her. Why hadn't she kill</span><span>ed</span><span> Vincent when she had the chance?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's this?" Vincent's voice turned ice cold. "Who said you could close your eyes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sergio, hold her down and force her eyes open!" he barked. "Make her watch Anthony die. Make her watch as we take his head!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent was losing it completely, high on his own bloodlust and twisted excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes... Mr. Vincent Turner." Sergio's voice wavered </span><span>slightly,</span><span> his hesitation obvious despite his attempt to hide it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the lady of the Turner family, after all. She had run the Turner family for over a decade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That kind of authority, built up over years, wasn't something to be disrespected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this point, Sergio had crossed the line of no return. Steeling himself, he strode toward Carolyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, using the chains to his advantage, he roughly grabbed her head and forced her eyelids open, making her face the massive screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sergio! Vincent! You animals!" Carolyn spat through gritted teeth. "If you're real men, then just kill me and get it over with!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For someone like Carolyn, this treatment was beyond humiliation. It was an absolute disgrace. Vincent's orders and Sergio's actions were nothing short of an insult to her dignity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As head of the Turner family, she'd never faced such degradation in her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was nothing she could do. Not only was she severely injured, but Vincent had also injected her with a power-suppressing drug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she was a Level C Elemental Metahuman, the drug had reduced her to a state of complete helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent threw his head back with a laugh, shrugging casually. "Don't blame me for being cruel. You brought this on yourself by being so damn stubborn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All you had to do was hand over leadership of the Turner family to me, and none of this would've happened."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you say, Ms. Carolyn Turner? Just name me as head of the family, and I promise you'll both walk free." Vincent leaned in closer with a smirk. "I'll even make sure you're taken care of in your golden years&mdash;the best retirement money can buy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!" Carolyn spat in disgust. "You monster! Get this through your thick skull. I'd rather die than let you take control of the Turner family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Without my blessing, you'll never be a legitimate head of the family. You'll always be </span><span>nothing but a traitor to the Turner name&mdash;just a snake who turned against his own blood!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent's face twisted with rage as he struck Carolyn hard across the face. "You witch! Don't test me. I could kill you right here and now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then do it!" Carolyn shot </span><span>back,</span><span> her voice steady despite the stinging in her cheek. "</span><span>Man up</span><span>, go ahead and kill me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vincent, stop!" Rose screamed, horrified by the scene unfolding before her. "If you lay another finger on Aunt Carolyn, Anthony will make you pay for it. I swear to God!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony?" Vincent's face twisted with rage, his eyes bulging as he growled, "Just wait! Once Anthony's dead, let's see who you've got left to save you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, despite his threats, Vincent couldn't bring himself to kill Carolyn, even after all this hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was right. Without her blessing, he'd never be a legitimate head of the family, even if he took the position by force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're finished, </span><span>you</span><span> worthless piece of trash!" Arthur's laughter boomed through the screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The footage showed Anthony backed against the cliff's edge, looking worse for wear&mdash;blood trickling from his mouth, his hair and clothes a mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur advanced menacingly, but </span><span>he </span><span>quietly muttered under his breath, "I don't know their exact capabilities, but those four are quadruplets."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From what I can tell, they're pretty much equal in strength. Vincent calls them the </span><span>Four </span><span>Demon Lords."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While pretending to be overwhelmed, Anthony's mind raced with this new information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Four Demon Lords!" Anthony thought. So </span><span>Necros</span><span>, the one he'd faced last night, was just one of them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anthony couldn't shake off the memory of </span><span>Necros</span><span>' terrifying power. That fight had been way too close for comfort. And now, Arthur was telling him Vincent had four warriors of that caliber under his command?</span></p></div>
