        <h1>Chapter 101 Armageddon</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen left the bedroom, her mind a whirlwind of confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh no. Could Ms. Turner..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After closing the door, Helen realized something, and her face drained of color. She was about to push the door open again but then hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Rose's maid, Helen knew she had an ultimate healing method.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this method only worked for the man she loved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't matter who the man was. What mattered was that he was the man she loved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Helen also knew that Rose had only been with Anthony for a few days. Could her feelings for him genuinely be called "love"?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What if it wasn't love?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wouldn't Ms. Turner be at a great disadvantage then?" It was Helen's first thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she stopped because she had another thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their few days together were brief, but Helen could see the sincerity in Rose's feelings for Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, during the recent battle, Rose's concern for Anthony and her willingness to do anything for him seemed to be enough to prove her love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Helen muttered to herself, "Love is such a strange thing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She simply sat on the sofa, propped her chin in her hands, pouted, and gradually got distracted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never been in love. To be precise, she had never been in love with a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Helen didn't quite understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Helen's thoughts wandered, a loud rumble came from outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even sitting in the safe house, Helen felt the ground beneath her feet tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were also occasional blood-curdling howls of wolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thunderous commotion made Helen's heart race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, she couldn't help but glance at the bedroom door, wondering, "Does this take a long time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps out of curiosity, Helen found herself standing up, approaching the door, and listening closely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! Anthony, faster. I'm coming..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door had good sound insulation, but as Helen listened closely, a series of moans clearly reached her ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, so embarrassing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen's face flushed with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly scampered back to the sofa, not daring to approach the door again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rumbling outside grew more intense. The earth shook as if it were the end of the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolf army pressed on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family fought a retreating battle until they had nowhere left to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, the Turner family's medical team arrived. Carolyn took emergency medication to heal and repair her injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family's medicine was very effective, incomparable to the healing drugs on the market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the werewolf army didn't give them that much time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Dariel alone resist them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With no other choice, Carolyn and Jane, who were halfway through their treatment, had to join the battle again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the sword move she used earlier had almost exhausted all of Carolyn's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The subsequent battle reduced her combat power significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, after another fierce battle, Carolyn was exhausted, her strength depleted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the contrary, Mason fought with increasing vigor, as if he had endless energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This battle really terrified Carolyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolves were not only numerous but also had extraordinary strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family had panaceas that could restore their strength in a short time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the werewolf army seemed to be able to recover their strength in an extremely short time through some means as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And from their situation, their recovery speed seemed much faster than the warriors of the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this case, even with the medical team's help, the Turner family still couldn't hold back the werewolf army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Men, the Turner family is about to collapse. Charge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill one member of the Turner family and get a reward of ten million dollars. Kill!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Break into the safe house, capture Rose alive, and get a reward of one hundred million dollars! Kill Anthony, and get a reward of one hundred million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family retreated outside the safe house. Mason, while fighting Carolyn, excitedly raised his arm and shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Great rewards inevitably attracted brave men, and werewolves were no exception. Mason's words instantly boosted the morale of the werewolf army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They seemed to be on steroids, staring with green eyes, brandishing sharp claws, and charging forward once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Carolyn, you must die today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the army pressing down, Mason roared and fiercely swung his long knife towards Carolyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shit! You damn beast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn cursed, not willing to show weakness. She swung her arm, instantly condensing a formless sandstorm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sandstorm coalesced into a long sword, slashing towards Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such an attack was no match for Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He casually swung his long knife, shattering the sandstorm, and the long knife fell to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn knew she couldn't defeat him and quickly retreated backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Mason was faster than her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, a strike aimed straight for Carolyn's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Beast! Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the long knife was about to fall, Carolyn's eyes widened, and she quickly waved her hand to cast a spell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the scattered sand condensed into a four-inch-long short sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though small, the short sword contained immense power. It was like a thin bolt of lightning, heading straight for Mason's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After casting this sword, Carolyn once again spat out blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her legs trembled, and she uncontrollably fell to the ground, her face turning pale.</span></p></div>
