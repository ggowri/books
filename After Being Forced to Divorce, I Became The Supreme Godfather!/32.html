        <h1>Chapter 31 The Tunnel Horror</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You seem to be in trouble. Why don't you come with me? I have a lot more to say to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing the tense atmosphere, Rose said with genuine concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony shook his head. "I know you want to protect me, and I appreciate your kindness. But there are some battles we must face head-on. Running away won't solve anything, will it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..." Rose replied, her voice laced with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony interrupted her, "Are we friends now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose quickly answered, "Of course!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony replied with a grin, "If I can't even handle this little issue, what right do I have to call myself your friend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he truly intended to convey was, if he couldn't even sort out this issue, what claim did he have to be her master?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But more than that, he was eager to test his own combat readiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These greedy pursuers were like a swarm of flies, and he needed to dispel them all at once. Escaping would only make them bolder and more relentless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen chimed in with a proud smile, "I like the sound of that. It shows you've got what it takes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose, still uneasy, said, "Alright then. Remember, no matter how dangerous it gets, you must get through this. I'll be waiting for you at the Turner Manor the day after </span><span>tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The day after tomorrow?" Anthony asked, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen laughed. "You fool! The day after tomorrow is Ms. Turner's..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Helen!" Rose cut her off, pressing an invitation into Anthony's hand. "You accepted my invitation. A gentleman always keeps his word. See you the day after tomorrow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony didn't know why Rose had invited him, but it was clear that the day after tomorrow was significant for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tucked the invitation away. "Don't worry! I'll be there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go! We'll walk out the door together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose smiled, extending her hand to Anthony and leading the way to the gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, she was no longer shy. In the astonished gazes of the crowd, she walked with her head held high, as if declaring to the world that Anthony was under her protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they left Dragon Guild, something odd happened. Rose's family guards, who were supposed to greet them, were nowhere to be seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! What are those guards up to? They didn't even show up on time to welcome Ms. Turner!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll give them a call and tell them to get over here right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen stamped her foot, pulling out her phone angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose's eyes sparkled, and she stopped Helen. "Maybe they were delayed by something. Picking me up isn't that important. Let's go back on our own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen frowned. "But, from here to the Turner Manor, we have to cross half the city. And we don't have a car."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose cast a fleeting look towards Anthony, her lips curving into a bashful smile, "Anthony, would you mind taking me home?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony understood that Rose wanted to spend more time with him and use her influence to protect him. He couldn't refuse and nodded. "Sure, let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great! Let's get in the car!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose was delighted, as if the absence of her guards was a stroke of good fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took Helen's hand and climbed into Anthony's SUV.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin and Anne stood nearby, watching. They exchanged knowing glances and signaled to the gang leaders who had signed the bounty orders, hiding in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, leaders from eighteen different gangs jumped into their cars and began to tail Anthony's SUV.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, they called their subordinates to set up roadblocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because Rose was in the car, they didn't dare to act yet. But they were determined to stick close to Anthony and strike the moment he was alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony concentrated on driving, navigating the city streets as the night deepened and the traffic thinned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the number of vehicles following them grew. These were the reinforcements summoned by the eighteen gang leaders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They sped through the night in separate cars, the engines roaring like beasts on the prowl. Every so often, they would veer close to Anthony's SUV, challenging him with the rev of their engines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen couldn't help but fume. "These ruthless killers from the underworld usually commit crimes and murder people. Now, they dare to provoke Ms. Turner, knowing she's in the car!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is really over the top!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner, we should teach them a lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose, sitting in the passenger seat, clung to Anthony's arm, her voice trembling. "Anthony, are we going to be okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony comforted her. "These people are after me, and I'm the one who put you in this situation. But don't worry, I'll make sure you get home safely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, the car entered a long, dimly lit tunnel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the tunnel, the lights flickered and then failed, plunging everything into an abyss of complete darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was even more alarming was the sudden disappearance of the vehicles that had been tailing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The monitoring vehicle in front had also vanished without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the tunnel's endless blackness, only Anthony's SUV continued to move forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of unease washed over Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bad premonition gripped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He subconsciously activated Devil Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, the voice of Devil Eye echoed in his mind, "Emergency warning! Move your head one inch to the right, now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost instinctively, Anthony tilted his head to the right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that split second, a bullet shattered the front windshield, whizzing past where his head had been just moments ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't moved, the bullet would have struck him square in the forehead.</span></p></div>
