        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony had long been aware that Mason was concealing a blade beneath his black robe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, this wasn't the first time Mason had employed such a tactic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, when Anthony's strength was insufficient, he would either be unable to dodge in time or be put in a very embarrassing situation by this sudden attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, times had changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the blade thrust towards him once again, Anthony was not panicked but instead let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the blade fell, Dragonfang appeared in Anthony's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with a speed even faster than before, Dragonfang struck towards Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dragonfang flashed with a cold gleam. In an instant, Mason's blade was as fragile as tofu, breaking into two pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason was shocked and exclaimed in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's strike was not only astonishingly fast but also seemed to have made Dragonfang much sharper than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Mason could recover, Anthony followed up with a kick, as fast, accurate, and ruthless as ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason was kicked dozens of feet away, slamming into the mountainside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the immense impact, the hard mountain rocks cracked bit by bit, with dust and debris flying everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason's burly body nearly embedded itself into the cliff wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the dust and smoke, he actually spat out a mouthful of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's kick carried an immense force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Anthony didn't want to kill him for the time being, he could have ended his life with a single blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony stood with his hands behind his back, looking down at Mason. "Do you want to talk now, or should I beat it out of you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! I will tear you apart!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Mason admit defeat so easily? He roared to the sky, his muscles swelling and bones creaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, his wide black robe bulged high, almost about to tear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bloodthirsty and brutal aura swept over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was not only a level-B superpower but also a werewolf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's gaze sharpened, and his pupils flickered with a mad and fiery light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The transformation into a werewolf took place in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason leaped forward like a giant wolf descending from the sky, his fangs terrifying and his claws gleaming with a cold light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fully transformed into a werewolf, Mason came aggressively, carrying an unstoppable murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Anthony unmoved, Mason opened his bloodstained maw and roared at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony stared at him calmly and silently, not at all panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they were less than a hundred feet apart, Anthony suddenly shuddered all over and roared to the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This roar was like a dragon's roar, earth-shattering and deafening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, the illusion of a dragon flashed above Anthony's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dragon brandished its claws and teeth, soaring in the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, violent winds raged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying and astonishing power seemed to come from ancient times, suppressing all areas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within a hundred feet, flowers and grass were annihilated, and trees collapsed as if it were the end of the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason, who had been running confidently, suddenly shuddered all over, and his body shrank by more than half in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His astonishing power was instantly shattered under the dragon's roar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason fell to the ground and curled up, shivering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolf body that had almost burst through the black robe just now quickly shrank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason turned into an ordinary person, curled up under the black robe, shivering and not daring to raise his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dragon's roar was one of the powers of Anthony's Leopard Avatar, evolving into the Dragon Avatar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It contained a terrifying force. Werewolves were no match for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, when Anthony was on the brink of death, Rose desperately revived him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, at that time, Rose also knew that pure healing power could not save Anthony's life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was only one way: the union of a man and a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family had a precept. Healing metahumans all had the most powerful healing method, but it was only applicable to those who genuinely love each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, if both parties loved each other, they would benefit immensely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the safe house, Rose took the initiative to unite with Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was pleasantly surprised because he knew that once they united, he would complete the second task of the Chosen Path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, after that, the Devil Eye indicated that the second stage task of the Chosen Path had been completed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Devil Eye was now version 2.0, and its power had been enhanced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It could invade electronic devices with intermediate protection levels. Data deduction, physical enhancement, and other functions had advanced to the intermediate level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's Leopard Avatar evolved into the Dragon Avatar, possessing the power of dragons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Energy-absorbing Breathing also evolved to level two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cultivation method was not only related to Anthony's overall strength but also to the duration of the Devil Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The higher the level of the method, the longer the Devil Eye lasted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, another star lit up in the Dragon Ring, representing that Anthony had become a two-star member of the Godfather Group with greater authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Promoted to a level-two member, he could receive a reward of 100,000 gold coins, and the Dragon Ring Space would expand tenfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Dragon Ring Store, more powerful items had been unlocked, such as the special, enhanced Inferno Gatling.</span></p></div>
