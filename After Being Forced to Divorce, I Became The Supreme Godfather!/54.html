        <h1>Chapter 53 A Wretched Life</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you laughing at? Answer my question!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's fury was palpable. Her sharp command pierced the air, demanding Anthony's compliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony responded with a cold sneer. "I risked my life to save Rose, led the charge, and fought with all I had. And yet, not only did the Turner family show no gratitude, but you also accused me of being the culprit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I came here today in good faith, but you keep blocking my way. Such ingratitude, such cruelty, what do you expect me to say?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine. If you want me to speak, bring Rose here. Let me ask her face-to-face. Why did I risk my life to save her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Rose doesn't come, I won't say another word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, you might as well kill me right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Anthony closed his eyes. Exhaustion clawed at him, both physically and mentally, yet his heaving chest betrayed the storm of anger inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing nearby, Dariel felt his heart in his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, Anthony's defiance was sheer madness. Speaking to Carolyn like that was a surefire way to court death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Anthony was innocent, his words might now seal his fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel could only pray in silence, hoping Rose would arrive in time to defuse the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, Carolyn didn't lash out immediately. The air remained still, heavy with tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long pause, her voice returned, now laced with a mocking chill. "What a sharp tongue. You're quite the shameless talker, aren't you? If the Turner family is as ungrateful as you claim, then fine. Tell me about the special drug you've been using, and I'll tell you why we labeled you the culprit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not a Metahuman. Yet you mimic their powers through a drug, similar to what those mutant werewolves use. This drug is incredibly rare. Apart from the Evil Spirit Legion, only the Godfather Research Institute has the means to develop something like it. Ordinary people couldn't possibly get their hands on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't tell me your drug came from the Godfather Research Institute, hmm?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's heart skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn hadn't even shown her face, yet she saw through everything. She knew he wasn't a Metahuman and had pinpointed the drug as the source of his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even more astonishing, she had connected the drug to the mutant werewolves of the Evil Spirit Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her knowledge confirmed that she was aware of the true culprits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony realized Carolyn's suspicions stemmed from the drug's similarity to what the Evil Spirit Legion used. She likely believed he was working with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony felt a flicker of relief, and her accusations had given him an idea. He raised his voice. "You're right! Since you've figured it out, I might as well admit it. I'm not a Metahuman. My strength comes from a special drug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And this drug, it's from the Godfather Research Institute! It's their latest creation, not yet officially released. I'm just one of their test subjects."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment later, murmurs spread like wildfire among the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne was the first to break. Her voice trembled with disbelief. "Anthony, I thought you were some hidden master. But no, you're just... a lab rat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You, you almost had me fooled!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin chuckled smugly. "Now it all makes sense! Anthony, after Anne dumped you, you decided to throw your life away and volunteer for drug trials. No wonder Ms. Ronald from Dragon Guild treated you so politely. You're a test subject!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We were all nearly fooled by you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel stared at Anthony, his jaw tightening. "Are you out of your mind? These experimental drugs are deadly. Test subjects rarely survive! Most either lose control or die from internal breakdowns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You need to find someone from the Godfather Research Institute and stop the experiments immediately! Otherwise, it's only a matter of time before you're ruined!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel didn't know why, but he subconsciously considered Anthony as one of his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony caught the concern in Dariel's eyes. It warmed him, and this was the first time he had felt genuine care from a stranger. But he couldn't reveal the truth, not now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If everyone misunderstood him, he might as well use it to his advantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled bitterly. "Captain Stein, thank you for your kind advice. But my life is worthless. I have no power, no influence. The only path I have is this dangerous one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the drug's side effects kill me or leave me crippled, so be it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel's eyes reddened. "Anthony, I've heard about your past. Forced into a corner, you took a gamble. I have to say, you've got guts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony smiled faintly, then turned to face the mansion. "Ms. Carolyn Turner, I've confessed. Now, can you tell me why you declared me the culprit? Don't tell me you don't know the truth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The estate remained silent for a moment. Then Carolyn's cold voice returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I know you're not the killer. I also know how much you did to protect Rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know the true culprit is the Evil Spirit Legion. But if I exposed their name, it would cause unnecessary panic. Pinning the blame on you keeps the public calm and blindsides the Evil Spirit Legion. It's a means to my revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And there's another reason, one I'm sure you understand. You have no place by Rose's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't deserve to be near her. You and she are from entirely different worlds. By branding you as the culprit, I could remove you from her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're a man who's gambled his life on an experimental drug, a man with nothing to lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A poor boy and a rich girl were never meant to cross paths. Does that explanation satisfy you?"</span></p></div>
