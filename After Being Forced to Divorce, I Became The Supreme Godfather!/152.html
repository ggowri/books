        <h1>Chapter 151 Biding His Time</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne wasn't about to let someone as powerful as Arthur slip through her fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Arthur had no intention of getting involved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He </span><span>wanted</span><span> to decline, but then a thought flashed across his mind. Changing tack, he said with a polite smile, "</span><span>Maybe</span><span> another time. I've got something to </span><span>do</span><span> right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Anne could press further, he turned and walked off in a hurry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Johnson! Bad news!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That person... she contacted Anne, and she said..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Arthur left the Smith Manor, he didn't waste a second. He immediately called Anthony to report what had happened, sparing no detail.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scent </span><span>of</span> <span>the letter was unmistakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It matched the person who had orchestrated the earlier attack on the Smith family, the very informant Anthony had been hunting for all this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's quick," Anthony muttered, sounding slightly surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused, then added thoughtfully, "This confirms Evil Spirit Legion is up to something big. They wouldn't be this desperate otherwise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Any idea what kind of strength we're dealing with?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No clue," Arthur admitted, shaking his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, after a moment's thought, he added, "But if I had to guess, it's no joke."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At the very least, we're talking about a C-level Metahuman. Maybe even Level D."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony frowned, tapping his fingers lightly on the desk. "Here's the plan. Find an excuse to join Anne on her trip to the </span><span>Virstino</span><span> Mountains."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Scope things out, but don't make any moves. If that person really is there, we need to confirm their identity first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a pause, he added, "Actually, forget that. I'll come along in secret in three days. Better safe than sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As cautious as Anthony was, he wasn't entirely convinced the person in question was a Level D Metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when it came to situations like this, it was better to be overprepared than blindsided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, Anne has been trying to recruit me into the Evil Spirit Legion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She brought it up again after receiving the letter. I've agreed to play along so she doesn't get suspicious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Smart," Anthony said with a nod. "Just gather intel for now. No heroics."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to see what the Legion is really after. Sometimes you have to cast a wide net to catch the big fish."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, understood."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony wasn't too surprised Evil Spirit Legion had pulled the Smith family into their levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What puzzled him was why they'd send Anne to the </span><span>Virstino</span><span> Mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to Seraph's earlier investigations, Evil Spirit Legion had already withdrawn </span><span>from that area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This only meant they were plotting something major, something worth the risk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why Anthony decided to bide his time. If they acted too soon, they'd risk scaring off their target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But ignoring the situation wasn't an option either. They needed to confirm the enemy's strength to prepare properly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From what Arthur had gathered, the opponent was likely a C-level Metahuman, formidable enough to be taken seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap between levels was no small thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For B-level Metahumans like Anthony and Arthur, their powers were limited to physical enhancements, boosting their strength and defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for C-level Metahumans, their abilities could manifest beyond their bodies. Take Carolyn, for example. As a C-level, she could summon massive swords out of thin air or stir up sandstorms with a flick of her wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That kind of power wasn't something </span><span>they</span><span> could just brute-force through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To prepare, Anthony got his hands on a batch of arcane tonic from Rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family was practically swimming in resources, and Rose wasn't stingy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After handing over the arcane tonics, she wrapped her arms around him and teased, "Don't push yourself too hard, alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Carolyn is planning to visit the Mines in seven days. I need you in one piece."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I'll be fine," Anthony replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to check out the Mines himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was too much at stake with the </span><span>Leyline</span><span> and the Chosen Path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the third phase of the mission could be successfully completed, even without Devil Eye achieving another breakthrough, his power would be bound to skyrocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, there was the Dragon Ring's reward to consider. With all of that, Anthony was confident he'd stand a chance against a C-level Metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Rose didn't seem thrilled about his urgency. With a faint pout, she leaned in closer, her voice turning soft and alluring. "Can't you take a break?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've been working nonstop, and I've missed you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she slid closer, wrapping herself around him, her breath warm against his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anthony chuckled, scooping her up effortlessly. Without another word, he carried her straight into the bedroom.</span></p></div>
