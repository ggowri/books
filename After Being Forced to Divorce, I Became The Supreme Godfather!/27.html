        <h1>Chapter 27 The Real Ganoderma-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you just say? Your item?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impossible! Where on earth did you get something as high-end as an M9?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin was flustered, struggling to accept what Anthony had revealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anthony couldn't be bothered to explain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Alvin opened his mouth to press the issue, Jane, who was seated behind the auction table, rose to her feet. "This M9 was indeed provided by Mr. Johnson," she declared with authority. "Congratulations to Mr. Johnson for the successful auction of this item. As the head of today's auction, I am announcing that we will waive the transaction fee. The total of 1.5 million will be transferred to Mr. Johnson's account immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the notification of remittance hit him, Anthony saw the amount, 1.5 million dollars, deposited into his account.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though it wasn't much compared to the 30 million dollars Rose had previously given him, the profit margin was staggering, considering his initial investment of only 7,000 gold coins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Alvin, whose face had turned a livid shade of red, Anthony said with a grin, "Thank you, Mr. Blake. If you ever need anything in the future, feel free to come to me. I'll give you a discount on bulk purchases."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin ground his teeth in frustration, his fists clenching at his sides. He wanted to retaliate, but with Jane herself vouching for Anthony, there was nothing he could say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin snorted inwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured, "Let's see if you can stay so smug next time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seething with anger, he sat back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly thereafter, Jane returned to the stage with an air of excitement and declared, "Now, we move on to the auction of the two thousand-year-old Eldergleam Fungi, graciously provided by the Smith family. The bidding will start at five million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thousand-year-old Eldergleam Fungus was an exceedingly rare treasure!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This miraculous elixir was known for its ability to revive the dead and regenerate flesh and bone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the stuff of legends, something that money alone couldn't buy. And yet, here it was, starting at a mere five million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deal was too good to pass up, and for a moment, the entire audience fell into a stunned silence. Even Rose's eyes sparkled with anticipation as she looked toward the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From across the room, Anne glanced at Anthony and gave him a knowing look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, however, feigned ignorance. His gaze was locked onto the pair of Eldergleam Fungus on exhibit. Following Anne's clues from the night before, he knew that the genuine article was marked as A, whereas B was a fake, crafted deliberately to deter theft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But from where he sat, Anthony could see no difference between the two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane announced with a clear voice, "You might be curious why we're starting the bid for these thousand-year-old Eldergleam Fungus at just five million. Here's the straightforward explanation: one of these is a fake. Our staff will now circulate the specimens so you can all verify them for yourselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After the verification, the auction will commence. It'll be up to each of you to trust in your own judgment, and there'll be no room for regrets once you make your move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let the verification begin!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The staff carefully carried the two items on a silver platter, starting with Rose's exclusive seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the only diamond member present, she was entitled to the first examination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose stood hurriedly, inspecting the appearance of both specimens closely and taking in their scent. After examination, her brows furrowed slightly. Clearly, even she was having trouble discerning the real from the fake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me take a look," Anthony said.</span></p></div>
