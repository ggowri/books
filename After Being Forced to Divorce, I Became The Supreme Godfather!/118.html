        <h1>Chapter 117 The Blitzkrieg Tactic</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the werewolves in such disarray, Anthony couldn't help but chuckle inwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, Arthur had mentioned that not all of those attacking the Turner family were werewolf assassins from the Evil Spirit Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The true werewolf assassins were few in number; most of the attackers were ordinary warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason they exhibited such fierce combat power was due to a special drug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this drug was different from the one used to activate superpower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony didn't get many details, as there was little time, but he understood that this drug would give people a burst of immense power for a short time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The drawback, however, was that the effect was temporary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, the werewolf army had been employing a "blitzkrieg" tactic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They divided into smaller squads, rushing forward in waves, using the drug in batches to maintain their overwhelming fighting strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony had sensed this tactic before so he could confirm that Arthur wasn't deceiving him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Arthur was out of the picture, the rest of the werewolf army couldn't possibly keep up their reckless assault on the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of them had already made up their minds to retreat, with only a handful of werewolves seemingly unwilling to give up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anthony, wielding the Inferno Gatling, was unstoppable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they didn't retreat, they would be dead for sure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolves were savage, but they weren't completely devoid of reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle was clearly lost, yet Anne still continued to egg them on, urging them to fight to the death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough talk!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Anne could say another word, Anthony roared, raising the Inferno Gatling once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't get too cocky! We'll see about that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Men, retreat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After waiting for a long time and seeing that Mason had not returned, the werewolf army no longer hesitated. With a wave of his hand, they dispersed in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Dariel stepped forward, urgently saying, "Mr. Johnson, they've killed so many of us! We can't just let them go like this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Evil Spirit Legion has committed too many atrocities. If we let them go, it will surely bring endless troubles in the future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel's words shocked the werewolf army, and without another word, they swiftly found cover, fearing that Anthony might change his mind and start shooting at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Johnson, the Evil Spirit Legion must be stopped! We can't let them get away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These damn beasts have killed so many of our men. We can't just let them go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them! We must kill them! Letting them go will lead to endless problems..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! Eradicate these beasts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Dariel spoke, the others immediately joined in, shouting with bloodshot eyes, filled with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family had suffered immense losses in this battle. After finally turning the tide, how could they let the werewolves go so easily?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furthermore, the werewolf assassins from the Evil Spirit Legion were notorious for </span><span>their evildoings, and they deserved to be eradicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the reaction of the others, Anthony furrowed his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason he wanted to let the werewolves go was that Arthur had told him that many of these werewolves could be useful as the initial members of the Draconic Shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were powerful and loyal, making them the ideal candidates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Anthony wouldn't share these details with Dariel and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Anthony was feeling conflicted, Carolyn raised her hand and spoke. "What are you all making a fuss about? What right do you have to question Mr. Johnson's decision?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Carolyn spoke, the Turner family members shrank back and dared not say more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn turned her gaze toward the werewolf army, her voice cold and stern. "This battle will not be forgotten by the Turner family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One day, we will exact justice!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For today, we'll let you go!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if there is a next time, the Turner family will stop at nothing to fight the Evil Spirit Legion to the very end!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Carolyn issued the command, the werewolf army still didn't dare to move immediately. They instinctively glanced at Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold expression, Anthony's voice rang out. "You heard what Ms. Carolyn Turner said. If you don't leave now, you're asking for death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, the werewolf army finally ceased hesitating and scattered in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the vast Turner Manor was shrouded in dust, only to return to complete silence shortly afterward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wh&mdash;what...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... You're not leaving? Hey, the Turner family is finished..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolf army quickly retreated, leaving Anne dumbfounded. She stood there, mouth agape, unsure of what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was Anne stunned, but everyone else was also left speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, Anne had told them that the Turner family was finished, confidently claiming they would divide up the Turner family's assets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why they had come along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, the werewolf army had been routed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose had broken through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had the Turner family just advanced by leaps and bounds?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no talk of dividing anything now! If things went poorly, the Turner family might even wipe them out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bitch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Anne wasn't leaving, Dariel's anger boiled over. He yelled. "What are you waiting for? Get the hell out of here! Do you want to die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a furious shout, several members of the Turner family surrounded Anne and her group, their faces filled with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony had let the werewolf army go, and now the Turner family members, filled with rage, had no outlet for their anger.</span></p></div>
