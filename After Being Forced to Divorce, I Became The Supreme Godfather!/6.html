        <h1>Chapter 6 Be Crushed</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly realized that after having sex with Scarlet, his energy felt unusually strong. His Devil Eye, in particular, was clearer than ever before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but wonder if spending time with women could actually enhance the power of his Devil Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Devil Eye's boost, his strength and speed were greatly amplified. His opponent's movements seemed to move in slow motion before his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And on top of that, he had the sharp Dragonfang dagger, a reward he'd received, which he wielded effortlessly, like it was an extension of his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, Anthony finally understood the true meaning behind the Chosen Path. It wasn't just about power but also about reclaiming the dignity that every man deserved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a man who aspired to be a godfather, the first step was to stand with dignity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before today, Anthony's dignity had been trampled on for far too long, not just by Anne and Scarlet but by everyone at the Smith Manor, including the man standing before him now, Timothy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You worthless piece of trash! You actually dared to hurt me! You're as good as dead today! I'll tell you, the whole place downstairs is full of my men. You're surrounded!" Timothy roared, his eyes bloodshot with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony smirked. "Perfect. I could use some practice today. Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he grabbed Timothy and started heading downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this was going to be revenge, then it was going to be big.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, he'd regain his confidence and dignity, and at the same time, see just how much power his Devil Eye could really give him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they reached the lower level, Anthony was immediately surrounded by twenty professional bodyguards under Timothy. Most of them were former mercenaries, hardened men who'd lived their lives on the edge, each one having taken more than a few lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They glared at Anthony with the intensity of predators, like a pack of wolves eyeing a lone, rebellious sheep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kid, let Timothy go and surrender now if you want to avoid unnecessary pain. Otherwise, I swear, I'll make you regret ever being born!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man named Jake, a loyal right-hand of Timothy, had a long, jagged scar running down his left cheek, making him look even more ferocious. In a fight, he was like a </span><span>rabid dog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jake unsheathed a curved blade, licking the edge with his tongue, his eyes gleaming with the hunger of a wolf who had just caught the scent of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other bodyguards followed suit, drawing their own weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jake, keep your eyes wide open. Today, I'm going to make sure you remember me for the rest of your life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony dropped Timothy and charged toward Jake without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jake was completely taken by surprise. Not only did he never expect Anthony to attack, but he also couldn't believe how fast Anthony was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flash of cold steel gleamed in front of him, and before he could react, a sharp pain cut across his right cheek. He wiped at it frantically, only to find his hand covered in blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clutching his face in disbelief, Jake snarled, "You cut my face!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony smirked coldly. "That mark will be your greatest honor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to rip you apart!" Jake's eyes were bloodshot with fury, and with a growl, he lunged at Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anthony didn't flinch. He casually swung his Dragonfang dagger, and with a loud crack, Jake's curved blade snapped in two, as if it were made of rotten wood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How the hell is that possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's that in your hand?" Jake stared at the broken pieces in his hand, completely dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's confidence surged with the power of the dagger. He grinned. "This weapon? It's called dignity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You all humiliated me before, and now? Now, I'm taking everything back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jake roared, "What are you standing there for? Everyone, go! Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the distance, Timothy shouted, "Kill him! A ten million reward for whoever takes him down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining bodyguards surged forward, their anger boiling over as they rushed at Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Empowered by his Devil Eye, Anthony tore into their ranks like a lion among sheep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His movements were lightning-fast, dodging their attacks with ease and countering with brutal precision. Every time the Dragonfang dagger sliced through the air, blood sprayed, and another bodyguard crumpled to the ground with a scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible? Isn't he just some freeloading guy? How does he have this kind of strength?" Timothy muttered, staring in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This speed... this skill... it's like he's a pro killer. No, he's better than any pro killer I've ever seen! He's been hiding his true power all along!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jake's mind spun with confusion and growing fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As each of their men fell, the terror in their eyes was unmistakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was no longer the useless parasite they had laughed at. He was transforming into a bloodthirsty demon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, Anthony had dropped all twenty bodyguards. He was tired but still had plenty of fight left in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing shouting from the direction of the front gate, he knew that Anne had brought </span><span>more people. A cold, calculating smile crossed his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell Anne this is just the beginning. The real fun's only just started."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Anthony turned and bolted toward the wall. He leaped over it with the grace of a predator, disappearing in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where's Anthony?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened here? Who did this to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne and Ben Holland arrived with a group of bodyguards, only to stop in their tracks when they saw Timothy and the others lying on the ground, bloodied and sprawled out in all directions.</span></p></div>
