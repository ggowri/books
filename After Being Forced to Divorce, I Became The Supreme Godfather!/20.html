        <h1>Chapter 20 The Second Task</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin's face lit up with excitement as he turned to Rose, asking, "Ms. Turner, did I interpret it correctly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose hesitated for a moment, then softly replied, "Mr. Blake's interpretation is very good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! Thank you, Ms. Turner!" Alvin shouted, his excitement impossible to contain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can rest assured, I'll stay by your side and protect you with all my heart for the next three days!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alvin leaped up, pumping his fists in the air. He had come here today with the singular goal of issuing a bounty on Anthony's head to avenge his family's honor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what a pleasant surprise this had turned out to be!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected that he could meet Rose, and now, being in such close proximity to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt that perhaps he could catch her eye and, one day, marry her. That would be the pinnacle of his life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alvin, can I come with you to protect Ms. Turner?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm Alvin's fianc&eacute;e! I don't want any money. I'll serve you for free, Ms. Turner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's voice rang out eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Alvin had caught Rose's attention, he looked at Anne with disdain and quickly dismissed her, "Anne, what are you talking about? Ms. Turner said she only needed one person. I'll be enough. Right, Ms. Turner?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner, there are too many eyes and the air is too polluted here. Let me escort you back to your private lounge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose shook her head gently, replying, "What you said is good, but it's not what I meant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin froze for a moment, unwilling to accept the answer. "What do you mean?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't believe anyone could interpret this better than I did!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen cut Alvin off coldly, her voice sharp. "Ms. Turner has already spoken. You failed the task. Stop rambling!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then turned her attention to the crowd. "Does anyone else have another interpretation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne immediately spoke up, her excitement building. "I believe this painting represents Ms. Turner's yearning for love!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "Why do you think that, Ms. Smith?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne, confident in her answer, eagerly explained, "What woman doesn't dream of eternal love? But beauty fades, and men's hearts are fickle. Most women's love stories are tragically short-lived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner's many lines, all intertwined, look endless. So, I deduce that you long for eternal love, a love that will never fade away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words were beautiful and romantic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd looked on in awe, enchanted by the interpretation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like women understood women better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Rose shook her head politely, smiling softly. "That seems to be your interpretation, </span><span>Ms. Smith. But as for me, love... it's not essential. I've never really dreamed of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The answer still wasn't right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's face fell, her disappointment clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others, unwilling to miss their chance, eagerly shared their own interpretations. Some even claimed the chaotic lines were a treasure map.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As each answer became more disconnected from reality, the hope in Rose's eyes slowly faded away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, she fell silent, her expression sorrowful, like a little girl who hadn't received the gift she'd hoped for. The sight was both heartbreaking and pitiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen, unable to hide her concern, spoke softly, "Ms. Turner, you're tired. We should go back and rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen helped Rose rise and began to lead her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the back of the crowd, Anthony finally called out, his voice filled with helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone turned toward him, their faces immediately contorting into sneers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin laughed mockingly. "You worthless fool, do you think you can get close to Ms. Turner too? Stop dreaming things!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne sneered, "None of us in high society can decipher Ms. Turner's thoughts, so what makes you think you're any better?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others chimed in, "Anthony, you're a dead man already! Once you leave here, we'll take your head and claim the one hundred million dollar bounty!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone about to die has no right to speak to Ms. Turner! Don't listen to him, Ms. Turner! He's just the worthless man kicked out by the Smith family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A good-for-nothing leech!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen frowned and said, "Ms. Turner, don't pay attention to people like him. Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose, listening to the insults, thought Anthony was just another ruffian and nodded in agreement, preparing to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony couldn't let the opportunity slip by. He chased after them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to his Devil Eye, he already knew the meaning behind Rose's chaotic lines. He had refrained from speaking up earlier because the Dragon Ring had suddenly notified him that the second task of the Chosen Path had been activated. He was supposed to win over Rose!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a sense of helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given his current status, even getting close to Rose felt like a wild dream. And winning her over meant becoming her master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe his grandfather had assigned him such an absurd task!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he had hesitated about how to approach it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, though, with Rose about to leave, he knew the moment was slipping away. He had no choice but to act fast and get close to her first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him approach, Helen scowled. "What do you want? Stay away from Ms. </span><span>Turner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony addressed Rose directly. "Ms. Turner, you issued the task. Anyone here has the right to share their interpretation. Don't you want to hear mine?"</span></p></div>
