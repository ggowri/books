        <h1>Chapter 14 Dragon Guild</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony frowned deeply as he considered what Seraph had said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dragon Guild wasn't just any organization. It was the crown jewel of Dragon Group, the most powerful corporate entity in Velmor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With branches across the country, the guild opened its doors three days each month for trading events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But entry came at a cost. Membership was tiered, with Bronze starting at one million coins a year, Silver at two million, Gold at five million, and Diamond at a staggering ten million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For most, even the lowest tier was an unattainable dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, the waiting list was endless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Membership wasn't just about access. It was a badge of honor. Simply attending a trading day meant you were part of an elite circle, where the who's who of society gathered. It was an opportunity to rub shoulders with influential figures, forge alliances, and expand your network.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than that, the Dragon Guild was renowned as the ultimate neutral ground. Deals made here, overseen by the guild's trading officials, carried an authority greater than any court-certified contract.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Breach the terms, and the guild would personally ensure justice was served.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many high-stakes negotiations were deliberately scheduled for the guild's trading days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't just about trust but also about credibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then there were the perks. From exclusive auctions to cutting-edge products developed by the Dragon Group, trading days were a treasure trove.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even families like the Smiths, newcomers to the world of wealth, could only dream of joining. Anne herself had to rely on someone else just to get a glimpse inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Anthony, divorced, penniless, with only three thousand coins in his account, his odds of setting foot in the Dragon Guild were as slim as a beggar getting invited to dine with royalty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head. "You're telling me to go there and take on some jobs to earn money, right? Sounds great in theory, but with my current status, I wouldn't even get through the front door."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph gave him a long, incredulous look. "You really don't know, do you? The Dragon Group, the one that owns the guild, it belongs to your grandfather."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Anthony's eyes widened. "You're saying the Dragon Group is his? Does that mean I can get in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph nodded, a smirk tugging at her lips. "Membership restrictions? Those are for outsiders. You don't need a membership. You're family. Take a look at that Dragon </span><span>ring you're wearing. It's a symbol of the core leadership. Even as a one-star member, you're high enough in rank to make the branch director bow and scrape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honestly, if you wanted the director to personally roll out the red carpet for you, that wouldn't be a problem either."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's heart raced with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He made up his mind on the spot that he would go to the trading day tomorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his abilities, if he could find the right tasks, he'd surely be able to make a fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, back in his room, he began practicing the Energy-absorbing Breathing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he focused his breath, the air around him seemed to shift. Tiny points of light began to flicker on his skin, faint at first, like scattered fireflies on a summer night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they multiplied, forming streams of light that flowed like a living galaxy, swirling around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Impurities in his body were drawn out and dissolved, leaving him visibly rejuvenated. His entire being seemed to radiate with a newfound brilliance, glowing softly in the darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Anthony left Seraph behind and chose a rugged SUV from the garage. With his spirits high and a confident stride, he made his way to the Dragon Guild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enormous parking lot was already packed with high-end luxury cars, gleaming under the morning sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the doors not opening for another thirty minutes, the entrance was crowded with people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all influential and wealthy. But here, at the Dragon Guild, every one of them stood quietly, their demeanor respectful and composed, like well-behaved schoolchildren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nobody wanted to risk disrespecting this sacred venue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Anthony stepped out of his SUV, a sleek Rolls-Royce pulled up beside him, its engine purring to a stop. The doors opened, and to his annoyance, out stepped Alvin and Anne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well," Alvin snarled, his face twisting with fury. "What the hell are you doing here?" His fists clenched as he glared at Anthony, his voice trembling with barely contained anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The previous night's engagement debacle still stung. Anthony had publicly humiliated him, exposing his secret in front of countless guests. Despite his best attempts at damage control, the whispers and mocking smiles from those around him had been relentless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, he and Anne had come to the Dragon Guild to issue an official bounty on Anthony, a declaration no one could ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him casually standing here, though, was like pouring salt on an open wound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony showed a smirk. "Isn't this the place everyone dreams of visiting? If you can be here, why can't I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne scoffed, her voice sharp and biting. "Still trying to act tough? You heard about </span><span>our plans and ran here to beg for forgiveness, didn't you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me make this clear, Anthony. You're not walking away from this unscathed. Unless you apologize to me in front of everyone, don't even think about leaving this place in one piece."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their loud confrontation quickly drew the attention of the other guests. Heads turned, murmurs spread, and all eyes were now fixed on Anthony, curious to see how he would respond to the spectacle.</span></p></div>
