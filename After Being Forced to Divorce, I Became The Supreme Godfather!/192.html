        <h1>Chapter 191 The Forbidden Territory</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lord Astaroth, wait!" Vincent's panicked voice cut through the air. "Stop! You can't go any further. That's forbidden territory ahead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When </span><span>Necros</span><span> saw Anthony and his companion fall into the valley, his first instinct was to jump in after them. But Vincent's desperate warning made him pause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Astaroth turned back to face </span><span>Vincent,</span><span> his brow furrowed in confusion. "Forbidde</span><span>n</span><span>? </span><span>Are you kidding me</span><span>?</span><span> </span><span>I saw it with my own eyes. Anthony took Rose and jumped down there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>W</span><span>hat?" The color drained from Vincent's face. "Lord Astaroth, are you </span><span>sure </span><span>about this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of cours</span><span>e</span><span> they did</span><span>!" Astaroth snapped</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eager to chase them and end it all, he added,</span><span> "I saw it happen right in front of me. Why would I make this up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent hesitated, cautiously approaching the edge to peek down before quickly stepping back, his face pale. "Lord Astaroth, there's something you need to know," he said, his voice tight with anxiety. "There's a terrifying legend about Abbott Cave. That's why we call it forbidden </span><span>territory</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What they were looking at wasn't actually a valley. It was a cave&mdash;an enormous, oval-shaped cavity in the mountain that, unless viewed from above, appeared to be nothing more than a vast canyon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer size of the cave entrance created a perfect illusion of a deep valley stretching into the mountain's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The depths below were pitch black and eerily silent. A cold, putrid air hung heavy in the atmosphere, sending chills down their spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rose?" Anthony called out as he brushed the dust off his clothes at the bottom of Abbott Cave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, can you hear me? Wake up." He immediately rushed to help Rose into a sitting position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just before impact, Rose had managed to summon her remaining strength to create a powerful protective barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the shield had absorbed most of the shock, the force had been so intense that blood had trickled from her mouth before she </span><span>passed out</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose struggled to clear her throat. "A-Anthony, I'm okay," she whispered, her eyes fluttering open weakly. "What about you? Are you hurt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry about me, I'm fine." Anthony let out a relieved sigh before surveying their surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite it being high noon, the valley was shrouded in an unnatural darkness that made it feel more like midnight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While not completely pitch black, visibility was severely limited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony squinted into the gloom, barely able to make out shapes beyond a hundred yards. The combination of dim light and dense vegetation created an impenetrable wall of shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking up, he could see the ancient trees had formed a natural canopy so thick that not a single ray of sunlight penetrated through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder the valley felt like it was trapped in eternal night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony couldn't shake the uneasy feeling that crept over him as he surveyed the valley. Something felt off, and his instincts were screaming danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a quick reconnaissance, he helped Rose lean against a boulder. "You mentioned something about this being forbidden</span><span> </span><span>earlier. What's the deal with Abbott Cave? It sounds dangerous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose had regained some of her strength. "This place," she said, gesturing around them, "is Abbott Cave. It's marked as </span><span>a </span><span>forbidden </span><span>territory</span><span> in the Turner family's ancient records.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know all the details, but Aunt Carolyn drilled one thing into my head since I was little. Never, under any circumstances, set foot in Abbott Cave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes met Anthony's. "She said that once you enter, you're as good as dead. Not even divine intervention could save you.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The ancient texts tell a story. Hundreds of years ago, a powerful warrior from the Turner family refused to believe the warnings. He swore he'd uncover the cave's secrets. </span><span>Yet h</span><span>e was never seen again.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Since then, every few decades, powerful fighters have come to explore the place. They all believed they were different. But every single one who went in </span><span>just </span><span>vanished without a trace.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's face darkened. His first instinct was to dismiss it as superstition, but he caught himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their current situation, Rose had no reason to make up stories. The warning had to be legitimate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, this wasn't just any rumor. It had originated from the Turner family and persisted for years. Where there was smoke, there was fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there anything more concrete?" Anthony asked, his guard rising. "Any specific incidents or stories about Abbott Cave?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Rose's words sent chills down his spine, they didn't hold up to scrutiny. Without any substantial evidence, it felt more like a legend than fact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's all I know," Rose shook her head helplessly. Her eyes met Anthony's, filled with both tenderness and despair. Her strange expression seemed to scream, "We're doomed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, however, remained calm. He understood that Rose's fear stemmed from childhood conditioning&mdash;a deep-rooted terror that had been instilled in her from an early age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was different. To him, this was nothing more than an unreliable myth, and why should he fear a myth?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Anthony was dismissing these thoughts, an unnatural wind whipped through the distant forest, making the trees dance with an eerie rhythm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A supernatural breeze stirred up an eerie black mist that seemed alive. Through the murky darkness, Anthony could make out a monstrous apparition with blood-red jaws, ready to devour anything in its path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anthony felt his scalp tingle with terror. What the hell was this thing?</span></p></div>
