        <h1>Chapter 150 Letter</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two hesitated for a while, and Anne nodded first and said, "I'll sign it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Arthur was very straightforward. He smiled at Anne and said, "Ms. Smith is so generous. I admire you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne breathed a sigh of relief and thought to herself, "Humph, I need to stabilize him first. He'll succumb to my charms!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately afterwards, Alvin no longer hesitated and signed for three years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several family leaders walked out of the gathered crowd. After a brief inquiry, they were shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was too expensive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the strengths of Draconic Shield and Arthur were obvious to all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Smith and Blake families taking the lead, others did not hesitate for too long and signed employment agreements with Draconic Shield one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur arranged for people to handle everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat in a chair and lit a cigar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne came to him, chatting and flirting with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Arthur didn't dare to do anything out of the ordinary in response to her attack, and his response was at most vague.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Anthony ex-wife, Arthur didn't dare to have any thoughts about her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, he really had no interest in this kind of woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur changed the subject and said, "Ms. Smith, it's almost time. Why isn't the Evil Spirit Legion here yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people looked at Anne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, everyone's main purpose was to join the Evil Spirit Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's appearance was an accident. And now, it had been resolved by Arthur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if the Evil Spirit Legion didn't come, it would be a problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur was, after all, a businessman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of financial resources, the Smith family could not compete with the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Turner family was determined to destroy the Smith family, Arthur might turn against them at any time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's eyes darkened, and she said, "Don't worry. The will definitely..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The evil spirit messenger has arrived!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Anne could finish her words, a loud shout came from outside the gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Evil Spirit Legion arrived!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, everyone present stood up at once and looked out the gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne was surprised. She waved her hand and led all the major families to rush out of the gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, everyone couldn't help but be dazed for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because there was only one person outside the gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tall and slightly thin man, dressed in casual clothes, with short, messy hair. He was nothing special.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, everyone was confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne simply knelt on one knee and said respectfully, "Welcome the envoy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Welcome the envoy..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Alvin and the others, who had just come to their senses, knelt down in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They dared not judge a book by its cover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one dared to pretend to be a member of the Evil Spirit Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, no one would impersonate a member of the notorious Evil Spirit Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, get up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The visitor smiled calmly, waved his hand with satisfaction, and then took out a black envelope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He handed it to Anne and said, "The envoy has something urgent to do and cannot come here in person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Therefore, I was specially ordered to deliver a letter and instruct you to make all subsequent arrangements in accordance with the orders of the envoy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne said, "Yes, sir."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lowered her head, hardly daring to look at the man. She took the envelope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Buzz!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, everyone just felt a gust of wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked up in surprise and found that the thin man had disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a messenger from the Evil Spirit Legion had such astonishing power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne was overjoyed, her hands trembling with excitement as she slowly opened the black envelope in her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The letter read: If you want to be successful, you must go to Virstino Mountains at dusk three days later to discuss our great cause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The concise paragraph was written in a vigorous and powerful style!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a seal at the bottom of the letter!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the exclusive mark of the Evil Spirit Legion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excited and surprised, Anne almost cried. What she had been waiting for finally came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Arthur in the crowd, suddenly took a small step back in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not because of the content of the letter, but because of the handwriting and the familiar yet strange smell on the letter!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It must be her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur would never forget this unique smell!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this in mind, Arthur said, "Ms. Smith, since the messenger had gone, it is time for me to leave. I'll arrange for someone to take over your family's security work."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait a moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne came back to her senses and said, "Mr. Hastings, I want you to personally protect me to Virstino Mountains!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With your strength, you might be able to accomplish a lot if you meet the leader of the Evil Spirit Legion!"</span></p></div>
