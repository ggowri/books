        <h1>Chapter 140 Loser</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's too cruel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony knocked out a Warrior with a single punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was Anthony really a loser? Or was he on drugs?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't seem to be on drugs. There were a few sharp-minded people in the crowd who noticed something wasn't right and instinctively took a step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given the situation, if Anthony had the guts to show up here, he wasn't bluffing. No one would risk making an enemy out of the Smith family without good reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he fearless? Was he relying on the Turner family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't look like it. The Evil Spirit Legion had its eyes on the Turner family now, and they were in no position to offer Anthony any protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, in the last fight with the Turner family, Anthony had shown far more power than Dariel. The Turners probably wouldn't send anyone less capable than Leo to guard him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Smith family was different. They thought they had Anthony all figured out&mdash;just a loser, a test subject who relied on drugs!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the fact that Anthony had admitted it himself, out of helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how could a "drug addict" have this kind of strength? It was baffling and </span><span>infuriating!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought he was lucky, being a test subject for the Godfather Research Institute. At this moment, even Anne and Alvin couldn't help but feel a bit envious. After all, who wouldn't want this kind of power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's lips curled into a cold smile. He walked toward Ben, saying, "So, now you know who the real loser is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since marrying Anne three years ago, he'd always been labeled as the loser. Everyone in the Smith family had called him that, and Ben was no exception. Back then, they had all thought of him as nothing more than a failure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's voice cracked with panic as she shouted, "If you kill Ben, the Smith family will hunt you down, no matter what!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this had happened before, Anne wouldn't have cared. But Ben was no longer just a head of security&mdash;he was now a Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That changed everything. To the Smith family, Ben represented their strength. Losing him in public would be a blow to their reputation that they couldn't afford.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what, Anne couldn't let Anthony kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony didn't stop. He smiled calmly and said, "You don't want me to kill him? Fine. Beg me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused for a moment, as if savoring the moment. "Don't you like begging me? Go ahead. Beg me. If you do, I'll let him go&mdash;and I'll even let the Smith family go free. How about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Anthony climbed over the collapsed courtyard wall and stood next to Ben, preparing to lift him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Asshole! You're dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben suddenly leapt up, slashing his knife straight for Anthony's abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a surprise attack&mdash;quick, fierce, as if it gathered all of Ben's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was nothing to Anthony. With Devil Eye active, even the most unpredictable attacks were clear to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His dodge wasn't quick, but smooth, graceful&mdash;everything went according to his expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A sneak attack?" Anthony chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben didn't waste time with words. He leapt again, his long knife striking with terrifying force, aimed directly at Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Anthony didn't dodge. He flipped his wrist and unsheathed Dragonfang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flash of light, and Ben's knife snapped in half.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Anthony moved forward, Dragonfang gleaming as it sliced across Ben's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Puff!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood sprayed from Ben's face as the blade passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben screamed, clutching his face, falling to the ground in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's strike was deliberate&mdash;Ben's wound wasn't life-threatening, but it was </span><span>enough to teach him a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was something Ben would never forget.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd fell into stunned silence as Ben, drenched in blood, writhed in pain, his cries echoing through the Smith Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Warrior of the Smith family had been defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Anthony remained as calm and composed as ever, showing no sign of taking Ben seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The difference in strength between the two was undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, Ben had been so arrogant, so confident. Now, he was reduced to a helpless wreck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne, watching from the crowd, felt a pang of panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't understand how Anthony had become so strong.</span></p></div>
