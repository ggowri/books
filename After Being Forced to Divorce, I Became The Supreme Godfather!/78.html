        <h1>Chapter 77 You Are Doomed</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing everyone talking to each other, Anne continued, "I advise you not to be stubborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The werewolves came for Anthony. The Turner family is reckless and want to live and die with Anthony. Do you also want to be buried with him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone said, "Yes. We don't even know Anthony. Why should we be buried with him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another said, "That's right. We are just here to attend the birthday party, not to die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Anne's words, the crowd was in an uproar and simply cried out in surprise, </span><span>stopping whispering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne smiled complacently, "The Turner family is declining. Everyone, it's time to make a choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those who have taken the initiative to draw a clear line with the Turner family and stay away from Rose can boldly come over here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the werewolves rush in, I will protect you from their invasion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right." Alvin echoed, "Take the initiative to draw a clear line with the Turner family and ensure your safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you refuse, you will be regarded as Anthony's accomplice and will be killed without mercy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up. You two are so shameless." Seeing this, Rose could no longer sit still and shouted angrily, "Aunt Carolyn and the Turner family's guards are fighting to protect everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you speak nonsense here and mislead the public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, please rest assured, the Turner family will do its best to ensure your safety..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne sneered, "Rose, you are the one who is misleading them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Carolyn is about to die. What else can the Turner family do to resist the werewolves? By you? Or by that bastard Anthony?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I admit that I underestimated him before. But so what?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the point of being strong? Carolyn couldn't stop the werewolves. How could he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolves were very powerful, which gave Anne enough courage. She not only called Rose's name directly, but also dared to disrespect Carolyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Turner family is about to be destroyed. What are you still wasting time on?" Alvin sneered and said fiercely, "Everyone, the werewolves are about to rush in. Why don't you make a choice?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Within three minutes, draw a clear line between you and the Turner family and Anthony, and I will ensure that you are safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, after the Turner family is destroyed, you will be killed without mercy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two's words caused unrest in the hearts of the people present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose was furious and shouted angrily, "Alvin, who do you think you are? How dare you say you can guarantee their safety?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are just passing on a message. Do you think you can..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone interrupted her, "Actually, Ms. Smith is right. We don't even know Anthony. Why should we die for him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another echoed, "Yeah. He's just a bastard. What does his death have to do with us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another woman said, "Ms. Turner, I advise you to make a choice as soon as possible. It's not worth it for a bastard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Rose could finish her words, the crowd burst into an uproar and then walked toward Anne and Alvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the crowded crowd in the banquet hall split into two parts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apart from the Turner family, there was only one person left by Rose's side, and it was Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, the crowd had been cheering for Carolyn. But now, they all joined Anne without exception.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The huge banquet hall was clearly divided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You. You guys..." Rose was dumbfounded. The change in these people was too sudden, and she was caught off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family had developed in Yoland for hundreds of years and had made indelible contributions to the development of Yoland and various major families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was no exaggeration to say that everyone in the banquet hall had received the favor of the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, several families could be said to be supported by the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, without saying a word, they chose to cut off ties with the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose was not angry but disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family had done so much for Yoland. But what had it got in return?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betrayal?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose was very disappointed and sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anne was delighted. She sneered, "What's wrong? Ms. Turner, are you angry?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Turner family can't even protect you. Do you want to let everyone die with you? Rose, you are too..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Anne felt smug, a dull rumbling noise sounded, which was deafening, like a mountain collapsing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked, "What's wrong? What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone said, "Oh, no. Could it be that the werewolves have rushed in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another said, "It must be. It's over. The werewolves must rush in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The huge noise caught the already nervous crowd off guard, and they were all frightened out of their wits and screamed, rushing to the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner, bad news. Mason is attacking the west gate. We can't hold on any longer." As the crowd was in panic, a guard of the Turner family covered in blood rushed into the hall staggeringly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Rose was shocked, and Anthony frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne laughed out loud and said, "Everyone, now you know how wise your choice was, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rose, Anthony, you are doomed."</span></p></div>
