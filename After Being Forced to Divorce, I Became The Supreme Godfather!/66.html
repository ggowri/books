        <h1>Chapter 65 Let Him Live</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing Carolyn's stern interrogation, both Vincent and Calvin retreated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin, trembling, hid behind Vincent and whispered nervously, "Mr. Vincent Turner, what do we do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent clenched his teeth and responded in a low voice, "The only way out is to protect me. If I fall, you'll have no chance of survival. So, you must take the blame alone. Understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Calvin could respond, Vincent abruptly grabbed his hand and shouted, "You ungrateful scoundrel! Just because Rose disciplined you, you hired a werewolf to </span><span>assassinate her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Confess now, and spare yourself the pain!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished, Vincent shot Calvin a sharp glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Calvin was terrified, he had to admit that Vincent was right. If he exposed Vincent now and Vincent fell, he would undoubtedly be doomed as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only way to survive was to protect Vincent and take the blame upon himself. Only then would Vincent have a chance to save him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was his only hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Resolutely, Calvin dropped to his knees and shouted, "Mr. Vincent Turner, please forgive me! I was wrong. It was my moment of madness, betraying the trust the Turner family placed in me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Carolyn Turner and Ms. Turner, please forgive me! I admit to everything! I'm despicable, a traitor who bit the hand that fed me. Please, for the thirty years I've served the Turner family, spare my life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will repay you in any way I can!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd fell silent, digesting Calvin's tearful confession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could have imagined that the infamous attempt on Rose's life, an incident that had shaken the city, had been orchestrated by Calvin, the Turner family's loyal steward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This seemingly honest and kind old man had attempted to assassinate Rose because she had discovered his embezzlement and bribery and had once reprimanded him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Rose had not made his crimes public, which was already a form of protection for him. Yet, he feared that once Rose rose to power, she would no longer tolerate him, leading him to take such a drastic and desperate action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was absurd and tragic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony sneered coldly, "Do you think we're fools? You couldn't have done this alone. Who gave you the orders?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you name your accomplice, your life will be spared."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?" Calvin hesitated, casting a glance at Vincent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent roared in fury, "You madman! You've already confessed, don't try to backtrack now. I'll personally kill you to avenge my cousin!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sudden thrust, Vincent drove a sharp dagger into Calvin's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin cried out in agony and collapsed lifelessly to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes, wide with shock and rage, remained fixed on Vincent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed to have so much left to say, but it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He should have realized long ago that when Vincent told him to temporarily take the blame and promised to find a way to save him, he was lying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he had already confessed publicly, how could Vincent allow him to live for even one more second?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the dead can keep secrets forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Calvin was gone, the crowd could only suspect Vincent of being the mastermind. But without proof, they were left with mere conjecture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Outrageous!" Carolyn bellowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face darkened with fury as her piercing gaze bore into Vincent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was livid that he had killed Calvin without her permission and suspected it was to silence him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing Carolyn's anger, Vincent immediately dropped to his knees, remorse etched across his face. "It's my fault for being careless, allowing this vile man to commit such an atrocity against Rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank goodness Rose is blessed with great fortune, and Anthony bravely protected her. Without them, this tragedy could have been far worse. As Rose's elder brother, I would have carried this regret to my grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But even so, I am guilty of negligence. I humbly beg Ms. Carolyn Turner to punish me. I will voluntarily leave the family and toil in the mines. I vow not to return unless I achieve something remarkable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, Ms. Carolyn Turner, for the sake of my late father, grant my plea. Otherwise, I have no choice but to end my life here as atonement."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he placed the blood-stained dagger from Calvin's death against his own neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heartfelt words and apparent willingness to die moved Carolyn, softening her resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially when Vincent mentioned his deceased father, who had also been of service to the Turner family, Carolyn, knowing full well that Vincent was merely putting on an act, chose to go to the mining settlement under the guise of pioneering, actually to seek refuge. However, she couldn't bring herself to execute him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long pause, she turned to Rose and said, "Rose, you're the victim and the family's heir. Decide Vincent's fate yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose, compassionate by nature, couldn't bring herself to watch Vincent die. Stifling her emotions, she said, "Big Brother, since you're willing to go to the mines, I'll grant your request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope you reflect on your actions and work sincerely for the family. If you achieve success there, I'll gladly welcome you back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent pressed his forehead to the ground in gratitude. "Thank you, dear sister!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The mines are harsh, with bandits roaming about. Please allow me to take my ten personal guards for protection."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose quickly agreed. "Of course. If you encounter trouble there, I'll send reinforcements as needed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Rose. Happy birthday. Until we meet again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent bowed to Carolyn, then rose to his feet. With his ten guards in tow, he strode toward the exit without looking back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he passed Anthony, his eyes glinted with the cold ferocity of a predator bent on revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony knew letting Vincent go was tantamount to releasing a tiger back into the wild, and he was a grave threat to the future. But at this moment, he had no power to stop it.</span></p></div>
