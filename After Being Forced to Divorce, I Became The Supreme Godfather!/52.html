        <h1>Chapter 51 King Tiger</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could have predicted that Dariel, the captain of the Turner family and renowned as the finest guard in Yoland, would be defeated in such a manner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His downfall came as he summoned his wolf form, ready to unleash a powerful attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he lay before Anthony, fear etched on his face, like a small beast in the jungle, revering the king of beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once-mighty werewolf had vanished in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"King Tiger, we apologize for our offense. Please forgive us, King Tiger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The individuals trembling on the ground began to plead, their voices quivering with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they begged for mercy, their flattery overflowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tigrine Metahuman capable of defeating Dariel was undoubtedly an invincible force in Yoland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This moment signaled the end of an old reign and the dawn of a new one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Representatives from wealthy families, skilled in shifting allegiances, would surely rally behind Anthony, eager to ride his coattails.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony!" Anne exclaimed, ready to rush over and throw herself into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait!" Alvin quickly grabbed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne whispered, "Alvin, let it go! The facts are clear: Anthony is truly powerful. As a tigrine Metahuman, he's destined to lead Yoland in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's been deliberately hiding his strength for the past three years&mdash;I know he's testing me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin gritted his teeth. "Calm down! Don't you find it odd? Anthony only let out a sound resembling that of a leopard or tiger&mdash;he didn't transform like Captain Stein.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he really is a tigrine Metahuman, why doesn't he transform?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne took a moment to gather her thoughts, gazing at the formidable Anthony. "Maybe he thought that just a shout would be enough to handle Dariel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, he took on so many assassins by himself; we both saw it with our own eyes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't buy it! He must have taken some drug. Just wait a little longer!" Alvin insisted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne sighed. "Fine. If you can prove that Anthony is a genuine powerhouse, don't blame me for breaking up with you. I'll do whatever it takes to get him to remarry me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, watching Dariel sprawled before him, felt a mix of surprise and elation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the true power of the Leopard Avatar granted by Devil Eye 1.0.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, Anthony's physique had been too weak, and even with the Devil Eye's help, he could barely tap into the strength of a tiger or leopard. But now, after enhancing his body with the essence and blood of the werewolf, he was able to summon the spirits of the tiger and leopard with the Leopard Avatar again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he didn't transform, the souls of the tiger and leopard surged within him, granting him the strength to defeat the Lupine Metahuman, Dariel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, this was also a fluke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel didn't know his true strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a genuine life-or-death fight, given Dariel's strength and experience, even with the full might of the Devil Eye, Anthony would likely only manage a draw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing the awe in Dariel's eyes and those around him, Anthony chose not to reveal the truth. As long as he could avoid confrontation, he'd conserve his energy for the real threats ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He adopted a serious demeanor and spoke, "Dariel, it would be easy for me to kill you! The only reason I've held back is for Rose's sake. And I believe you are loyal and reliable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I swear again, I am not the murderer but the protector who saved Rose. Today, I'll deliver the true murderer to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You believe me now, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel retracted his werewolf form and returned to his normal appearance, his eyes filled with deep respect for Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bowed and said, "I was wrong before. Now I believe you, Mr. Johnson. You are </span><span>the honored guest invited by Ms. Turner. Please, come in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony nodded, striding toward the gate with his head held high, a true VIP in front of the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, wait for me!" Anne called happily. "We've been husband and wife for three years, and we share a deep bond. I'll come with you! I'll testify that it was you who saved Ms. Turner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She started to rush over, but Alvin tightly gripped her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You jerk!" Anne suddenly slapped Alvin hard and snapped angrily, "Who do you think you are? Stay away from me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am King Tiger's woman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin was taken aback by Anne's shamelessness. Seeing Anthony's display of strength, she had turned her back on him. Anger coursed through him as he held onto Anne's hand tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Anthony strode confidently toward the gate, Anne's anxiety flared, and she raised her hand to strike Alvin again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, from within the manor, a dragon's roar reverberated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was shocked and looked up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They saw a yellow tornado spiraling down from the sky above the manor, descending with devastating force and heading straight for Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It instantly enveloped Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the dragon's roar echoed, Anthony looked up in shock, and a sense of dread washed over him as his heart raced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You hold on first. I'll take a nap," the Devil Eye said before fading into silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had actually fled!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew this also indicated the tornado was too formidable, even for the Devil Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the tornado barreled towards him, Anthony felt like a leaf adrift on an endless ocean, tossed about with no control of his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surrounded by the swirling vortex, he suddenly felt desperate.</span></p></div>
