        <h1>Chapter 189 Strategic Retreat</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony wasn't running away. He needed to find the </span><span>Leyline</span><span> and complete the mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep in his gut, he knew that completing the Chosen Path would trigger Devil Eye's evolution to version 3.0.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This advancement would simultaneously push his abilities to Level C, giving him the strength he desperately needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Level C powers under his belt, Anthony felt confident he could finally go toe-to-toe with Mordred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could take down just one of the Four Demon Lords, the others wouldn't be a threat anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, he was certain now that the </span><span>Virstino</span><span> Mountains housed a </span><span>Leyline</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His chances of finding it weren't just pipe dreams anymore. There was real hope here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And where there was hope, Anthony was ready to take the gamble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But fate had other plans. Before he could make his move, a blood-red spear cut through the air like crimson lightning, its deadly power radiating in waves as it hurtled toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive wall of sand erupted from nowhere, condensing into a thirty-foot sword that crashed down with surgical precision, intercepting the spear mid-flight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The collision was spectacular&mdash;the sand sword exploded into a million particles, but it had done its job. The deflected spear went wide, missing Anthony by several yards and embedding itself in a nearby tree with devastating force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The massive tree, thick enough that three people couldn't wrap their arms around it, splintered in half under the force of the spear. A crimson mist rose from the destruction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run!" Anthony's eyes flashed with determination as he grabbed Rose's hand, all hesitation gone as they sprinted away from the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not </span><span>going anywhere</span><span>!" Mordred's roar echoed through the air as he tried to push past Carolyn to chase after Anthony and Rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn wasn't about to let that happen. She summoned a massive sandstorm that rose like a dense fog, completely engulfing Mordred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as she thought she had him trapped, a massive fist burst through her barrier of sand, catching her completely off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Carolyn could react, the fist came crashing down. The impact sent her flying nearly a hundred feet back, blood spraying from her mouth before she even hit the ground. That single punch had drained almost all the power she'd managed to gather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pathetic," Mordred sneered, barely sparing her a glance. "You're just a badly wounded Level C Metahuman, and you think you could stop me? How delusional." Without another word, he sprinted after Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn was right about one thing&mdash;Vincent wouldn't let anyone kill her, at least not until he had complete control over the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mordred knew this too, which explained why he'd only severely wounded Carolyn rather than going for the kill when he had the chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn felt her blood run cold as she realized just how much stronger Mordred was compared to Malakar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When channeling his dark magic, his combat ability nearly matched a Level C fighter, which was terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And if Mordred was this powerful, what did that say about Astaroth, their leader?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was probably Level C even without using dark magic. And with it... Carolyn didn't even want to finish that thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization sent chills down her spine, but she couldn't afford to let fear slow her down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Mordred could close the distance, she focused her power and ripped several massive trees from the ground, sending them crashing down to block his path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But such obstacles meant nothing to someone like Mordred. With his overwhelming defensive abilities, he simply plowed straight through them. The thick tree trunks&mdash;each wider than a man&mdash;shattered like paper in his wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn had expected as much. She hadn't really thought the trees would stop him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why, even as the trees fell, she was already gathering the sandy soil ahead into several sharp-edged swords, sending them hurtling down toward Mordred's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The massive sword brought with it an overwhelming force, stirring up a sandstorm that darkened the very sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Carolyn held the blade aloft, blood trickled from the corner of her mouth, but she couldn't afford to worry about that now. With every ounce of strength she had left, she forced the sword downward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground shook as her devastating attack sent Mordred, who had been smashing through trees, flying backward and crashing to the earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The swirling sand began to coalesce into a single mass&mdash;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the sand could fully manifest its power, a thunderous voice split the air. </span><span>"CAROLYN! How dare you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the carefully gathered sandstorm dissipated into nothing, scattering to the winds as if it had never existed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's heart froze. She whirled around, blood draining from her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like a shadow come to life, another guy - could've been Mordred or Malakar's twin - came barreling at her, black clothes whipping in the wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh god, no," she whispered, her face growing even paler. There was no mistaking the green sash he wore&mdash;this was Astaroth, the most powerful of the Four Demon Lords.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking past him, Carolyn's blood ran cold as she spotted </span><span>Necros</span><span>, Malakar, and Vincent standing there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could even process her shock, Mordred materialized like a ghost and struck her with a devastating punch that sent her flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get them!" Mordred's body quickly returned to its normal form as he shouted to Astaroth. "</span><span>Anthony's</span><span> escaped with Rose!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>E</span><span>scaped?" Astaroth's face darkened with a sinister smile. "They won't get far."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through Carolyn's fading vision, she watched as Astaroth vanished into the forest with inhuman speed. "So fast..." was her last conscious thought before darkness claimed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep in the forest, Anthony gripped Rose's hand tightly as they ran for their lives. He knew Carolyn wouldn't be able to hold Mordred back for long, and with Vincent and the other three demon generals closing in, they couldn't afford to stop even for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But they hadn't made it far when Anthony heard the telltale whistle of something cutting through the air behind them.</span></p></div>
