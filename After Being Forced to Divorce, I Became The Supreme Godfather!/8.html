        <h1>Chapter 8 The Enemy of My Enemy</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony! How dare you show your face here!" Anne's voice trembled with shock, her expression frozen in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man had just slept with her stepmother, injured over twenty people, and turned the manor upside down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was certain he'd vanish, too scared to ever resurface. Yet here he was, walking straight into the spotlight, brazen and alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben, still fuming from losing Anthony earlier, saw his chance. With a sharp gesture, he led a dozen bodyguards to encircle Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard!" Ben snarled, a polished triangular blade sliding from his sleeve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So it was you who attacked Timothy and the others! Face your death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait." Alvin's mocking tone cut through the tension. "You know, I was thinking our engagement party was missing something. But this fool showing up? What perfect timing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, why don't you stick around? After Anne and I get engaged, you can stand by the table and pour drinks for the guests. Who knows? Maybe I'll take pity on you and spare your miserable life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room erupted in laughter, the crowd relishing Alvin's derision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go on, thank Mr. Blake for his mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pouring wine for Mr. Blake and Ms. Smith is the highlight of your life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clearly, he's here to grovel, trying to beg for scraps!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or maybe he's hoping for a cut of the divorce settlement."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The taunts flew fast and mercilessly, their scorn painting Anthony as nothing more than a pathetic jester.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anthony met Anne's eyes with a cold smile, his voice steady. "I told you, I came bearing gifts. Three of them, to be exact."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's gaze hardened. "Do you honestly think some grand gesture will win me back? Don't be ridiculous. No matter what you've prepared, I'll never take you back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You and I live in different worlds. Alvin is my destiny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're hoping for money from the divorce, forget it. You won't get a penny from me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's smirk deepened. "I've said it before. I don't want a single cent of your family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin scoffed, leaning forward as if to inspect a sideshow act. "Alright then, loser. Let's see what you've got."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guests cheered, eager for a spectacle. "Yeah, show us your big gift already!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony spotted Anne's cousin, Thomas Smith, sitting in a corner, sulking with a few </span><span>bodyguards while nursing his drink. Smirking, he walked over. "Thomas, how's it going?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas shot him a cold look. "Stay the hell away from me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony laughed. "I get it, you hate me. You blame me for helping Anne become the heir. But things are different now. The enemy of my enemy is my friend, right? Time for you to protect me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Smith family, any woman who married and moved out automatically forfeited her inheritance rights. Anne, hungry for power, had invited Anthony into the family home to solidify her position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony had helped her win that battle against Thomas, so he'd become the target of Thomas' fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas gritted his teeth. "Who the hell do you think you are? You're just a dog we kicked out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go away, or I'll smash your head!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas' grip tightened on his glass, the frustration clear on his face. He didn't want to be here, but he had no choice. He was already drunk and fuming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony leaned in, his tone smug. "Do you know how Anne beat you in that crucial project and earned the Elder Council's favor?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas furrowed his brow. "You're talking about the results from the last quarter? The projects we were each in charge of?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony nodded. "Exactly. The Elder Council gave you both a project to run, and the one who brought in the highest profits was supposed to win. You lost, so you had to step aside for the inheritance. But here's the thing. Anne's project didn't make as much as she claimed. Her financial statements? They're fake."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas' eyes widened. He shot to his feet, anger flaring. "What? Are you serious? Do you have proof?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Anne, finally realizing Anthony's plan, snapped, "Anthony, shut up! You're spreading lies! Ben, grab him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben charged forward immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas, however, quickly understood why Anthony had come to him for protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He and Anne were enemies, and now, Anthony had become one too. That made them allies, at least for the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop right there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one touches Anthony while I'm here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, tell me the truth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flick of his wrist, Thomas signaled to his bodyguards, who swiftly moved to block Ben.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony gave a devilish smile, relishing the chaos. "Take a good look, Anne. Here's your first big gift. You're not the business genius everyone thinks you are. You only beat Thomas because you faked the numbers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pressed a button on a hidden remote, and the large screen behind the stage flickered to life. At first, it showed Alvin and Anne in their happy engagement pictures. But the image quickly shifted to a series of financial data, exposing the lies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas, now furious, spat out the words, his face red with rage. "Anne! You've been </span><span>faking the books! You're a fraud!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't accept this! I should be the one to inherit the family fortune!"</span></p></div>
