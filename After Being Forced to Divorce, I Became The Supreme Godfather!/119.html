        <h1>Chapter 118 Hopeless</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the Turner family appeared, their intimidating aura and murderous intent were clear. Alvin and the others instinctively lowered their heads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to fight me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Anne was unfazed. She stood proudly and scoffed. "A bunch of brainless fools! What's there for you to be so cocky about?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think that if Anthony didn't join Mr. Foster, he'd have made it back alive?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think that such a useless man is your family's savior?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Better watch your backs&mdash;he might betray you, and you wouldn't even see it coming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne stood tall, exuding confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin, who had been shrinking back, straightened his back and spoke up. "Anthony definitely joined Mr. Foster. Everything was just an act!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He came back to convince you all to join Mr. Foster, or he's planning to secretly undermine the Turner family. You'd better watch out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what, Alvin wasn't about to let Anne steal the spotlight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He, being a grown man, certainly didn't want to be overshadowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne ignored Alvin and shouted at Anthony. "If you're still a man, tell me, did you join Mr. Foster?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony smiled helplessly and said, "Do you think everyone is as cowardly as you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Willing to abandon their dignity and sell their soul just to survive?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me warn you all&mdash;don't let yourselves be used as pawns in the service of evil!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Evil Spirit Legion has done countless wrongs and is despised by all. One day, they will be eradicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't want to be implicated, it's best to distance yourselves from certain people, or else you'll face the consequences!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Anne, Anthony couldn't be bothered to waste words on her, but the others from Yoland seemed not completely beyond saving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne was enraged. She cursed. "Anthony, you're nothing but trash. Stop spreading lies!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really think you can take down the Evil Spirit Legion? What are you, some kind of hero?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't think that because you deny it, it's going to disappear!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've joined the Evil Spirit Legion, and that's an undeniable fact. Otherwise, you wouldn't have survived to come back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think that without Mr. Foster around, you can say whatever you want?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just wait. I'll meet Mr. Foster myself and expose your lies!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And as for your Turner family...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seven days from now, I'll host a banquet at the Smith Manor and officially announce that families from Yoland are joining the Evil Spirit Legion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'd better make up your minds quickly. If you're still stubborn after seven days, the Turner family will once again be drenched in blood!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The banquet, initially meant to celebrate their "wise" choice of aligning with the Evil Spirit Legion, had now taken on a different tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Mason hadn't returned and the werewolf army had retreated, Anne was a bit confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she didn't believe that Anthony would defeat Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite not seeing Mason, Anne was confident that after seven days, the banquet would still take place, and Mason would arrive at the Smith Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When that happened, the Smith family would become the leading power in Yoland, a force that could rival the Turner family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps, one day, they might even surpass them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Anthony?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hmph! Just a trash talker&mdash;his lies would be exposed sooner or later!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A banquet? Joining together?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Anthony heard this, he frowned and looked at the other people around Anne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was somewhat familiar with the families of Yoland, and it wasn't an exaggeration to say that Anne had already managed to win the support of over 80% of Yoland's families!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If these families actually did join the Evil Spirit Legion, it would indeed be a loss for Yoland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Anthony wasn't concerned that they would truly join, because they didn't even have that opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason he frowned was that he felt the Smith family's banquet might be a good chance for him to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, are you scared?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Anthony frown, Anne sneered and arrogantly said, "Just a moment ago, who was it that boldly said they would eliminate the Evil Spirit Legion?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you're so brave, the doors of the Smith Manor will be open to you seven days from now. Are you daring enough to come?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Anne glared fiercely at Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Rose frowned and instinctively squeezed Anthony's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A banquet at the Smith Manor?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And they are inviting the families of Yoland to publicly announce their allegiance to the Evil Spirit Legion?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn't this obviously a trap?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony subtly squeezed Rose's hand, signaling her not to worry. He then turned to Anne and said, "Alright, I'll come to the banquet seven days from now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Anthony agree, before Anne could say anything, Alvin shouted. "You said it yourself. If you don't show up, you're nothing but a coward!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can leave now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of his hand, Anthony's guard team, led by Dariel, immediately expelled Anne and her group from the Turner family Manor.</span></p></div>
