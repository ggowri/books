        <h1>Chapter 71 Hand-To-Hand Fight</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Rose and Carolyn supported him so wholly and firmly, Anthony glanced at Jane. Then, they both smiled knowingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two had not expressed their opinions yet, just wanting to see what choice the Turner family would make when facing the critical moment of the attack by the Evil Spirit Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony trusted Rose, but he was a bit unsure about Carolyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Carolyn had previously coldly declared him a murderer and was going to use someone else to get him killed, knowing that he was Rose's savior, but only because she didn't think he was good enough for Rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, it was difficult for Anthony to trust her completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Carolyn chose to abandon him again for the sake of the overall situation under the pressure of the Evil Spirit Legion, Anthony would stay away from her and no longer have anything to do with the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Anthony got the answer he wanted and knew Rose and Carolyn were both people he could trust. He then secretly decided to include them in his future empire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Carolyn Turner..." Just as Anthony was about to express his opinion, he heard a loud howling of wolves from outside the gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, Mason, who had been waiting for an answer, was outraged after hearing Carolyn's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His roar made everyone feel that there was a mad wolf violently leaping around in front of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason said, "I never thought that Ms. Carolyn Turner, who is said to be a mighty hero, would be so soft-hearted. Since you are short-sighted and are willing to gamble the fate of the Turner family for Anthony, I will grant your wish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Evil Spirit Legion will take revenge, and Anthony must die today. Boys, listen to my order. Attack."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attack horn sounded, and the mutant werewolf killers waiting outside could no longer wait. They howled together and began to attack Turner Manor's gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner Manor was like a huge fortress. In addition to the elite bodyguards led by Dariel, there were also sturdy gates and towering walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Various hidden weapons were hidden behind the gate and inside the courtyard wall, which the werewolves' attack triggered, and gunfire rang out immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bullets repelled the werewolves' first attack. But although these bullets could stop the werewolves, they could not really hurt them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the help of mutant drugs, these werewolves' bodies were strong enough to resist ordinary bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They will soon break through the front gate. Ms. Carolyn Turner, let me go." Dariel's eyes turned bloodshot, and he gritted his teeth again to ask for instructions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn looked solemn and said, "Dariel, now is the time for you and your men to show your loyalty. Listen to my order. You lead the team to the main gate and wait. When the werewolves break through the gate, kill them immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Werewolves have committed many evil deeds and deserve to die. I declare that I will reward you one hundred million dollars for every werewolf killed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected of Carolyn of the Turner family, she was really generous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One hundred million dollars was enough for an ordinary person to live a worry-free life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the guards became excited after hearing that, holding their submachine guns, ready to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it. We will complete the mission. Follow me." Dariel rushed towards the main gate with a group of elite henchmen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Show me the surveillance footage. I want to supervise the battle personally," ordered Carolyn loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, the servant took action and projected the surveillance footage of the main gate onto the large screen next to the banquet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony looked hurriedly over and saw more than a dozen werewolves gathered outside, desperately attacking the sturdy gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On a rock not far behind the werewolves stood a tall man covered in a black robe, with only a pair of green eyes showing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at the Turner Manor with flickering eyes, like a ghost staring at a delicious cake, thinking about how to swallow it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was evident that he was Mason, the one responsible for planning this attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony thought, "Ordinary mutant werewolf blood has no effect on me. But if it were a higher level of werewolf blood, it would definitely help me improve my strength once again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was excited and whispered to Jane beside him, "Can you tell what this guy's strength is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane whispered, "The mutant werewolves that attacked us are at the same level as the previous killers. They rely on drugs to stimulate their nature and can barely be considered Level A metahumans. They are no match for Dariel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But this leader looks advanced. I think he should be at least a Level B metahuman. They are coming for you, so be careful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Anthony felt a little unsure. He knew that even if he unleashed all his potential, he would still not be able to defeat a Level B metahuman with his current strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a little depressed, thinking, "It will be great if the Devil Eye can break through again. I don't know what functions the Devil Eye will gain after that, but I'm sure that as long as it breaks through to version 2.0, I can definitely deal with this Level B metahuman easily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Anthony was thinking, there was suddenly a loud bang in front of him. Anthony looked over hurriedly. On the screen, he saw a big hole in the sturdy door caused by the ferocious werewolves. Before they could get in, Dariel, who had been waiting for a long time, rushed out and started a hand-to-hand fight with the werewolves.</span></p></div>
