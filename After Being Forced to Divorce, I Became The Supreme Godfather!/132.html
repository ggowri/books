        <h1>Chapter 131 The New Head of the Smith Family</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Smith Manor was decked out in festive decorations at the crack of dawn, with music and excitement filling the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone passing by might have mistaken it for a wedding celebration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the main gates, a sea of people gathered. Luxury cars lined the driveway as the city's elite arrived in their finest attire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This banquet was no small affair. The Smiths had managed to attract over eighty percent of Yoland's most powerful families. The significance couldn't be understated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ladies and gentlemen!" Anne called out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did any of you ever imagine that the Smith family would have such a day? Where we'd command the attention of the entire city?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing at the main table in the estate's grand hall, Anne cut an imposing figure in her blue evening gown, holding a wine glass with aristocratic grace as she addressed the family elders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We never dared to dream..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such grandeur was beyond our wildest imagination before..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Indeed, the Smith family's rise to power and control over Yoland is all thanks to Ms. Smith's exceptional capabilities..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely right. If it weren't for Ms. Smith's brilliant decision to ally with the Evil Spirit Legion when we were backed into a corner, the Turner family would have isolated us completely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, yes, the Smith family's current success is entirely due to Ms. Smith's contributions..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's single question had set off a cascade of enthusiastic praise from the elders, their excitement palpable in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Smith family's influence grew, their status as family elders naturally came with plenty of perks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, they weren't wrong - they'd never dreamed the Smith family could reach such heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Smith family was just nouveau riche, worth only a few billion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the crowd below were actual elite families worth tens of billions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet even they had to bow down to the Smith family now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After today, the Smith family would officially join the Evil Spirit Legion. Their meteoric rise was practically guaranteed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon enough, they'd indeed surpass the Turner family and rule all of Yoland!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne smiled coolly, tilting her head back with utter disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her proud posture resembled that of a haughty canary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then her brow furrowed, and she asked impatiently, "Where's Grandpa? Why isn't he here yet?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if Mr. Foster arrives early? It would be terribly rude if Grandpa, our family head, isn't here to greet him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne might be the Smith family heir, but she wasn't yet the head of the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last night, Anne had gone to see the family patriarch, her grandfather Galvin Smith.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd lied, claiming Mason had said that if they were to accept the Smith family, they needed to deal directly with the family head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She claimed they didn't know much about the Smith family yet and only knew Anne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or rather, they only trusted Anne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The implication was clear. "Man, it's time for you to step down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the leader of the Smith family, Galvin was no fool. He understood Anne's intentions perfectly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, Anne had done the Smith family a tremendous service.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And since she was already the Smith family's heir, Galvin saw no reason to play games.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd promised to announce his retirement today publicly and formally name Anne as the new head of the Smith family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So when Galvin was late, Anne couldn't help feeling annoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's with this older man who should've retired ages ago putting on airs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir Smith has arrived!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Anne's patience was wearing thin, a commanding Rolls-Royce Phantom pulled up outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out stepped an older man with white hair, wearing a burgundy suit and leaning on a dragon-headed cane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his advanced age, he radiated vitality and energy, his bearing projecting the unmistakable authority of someone born to lead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Galvin, the head of the Smith family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a self-made man known for his ruthless tactics, which had single-handedly elevated the Smith family to its current heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Galvin stepped out, family heads, both big and small, swarmed around him, showering him with endless flattery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Smith family's rise was unstoppable, and no one dared look down on any of its members now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Much less its patriarch himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Galvin received all the flattery with a warm smile, like a kindly grandfather greeting each guest personally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ladies and gentlemen!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First, I want to thank you all for taking time from your busy schedules to attend this modest family gathering."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After this brief pleasantry, Galvin got straight to the point. "I'd like to take this opportunity to make an announcement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Given my advanced years, I no longer have the energy to manage the Smith family's </span><span>business empire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My granddaughter, Anne, has shown exceptional intelligence since childhood and is more than capable of taking on this responsibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Therefore, I hereby announce my retirement, effective immediately, and officially name Anne as the new head of the Smith family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these words, Galvin took Anne's hand and guided her to the front while he took several slow steps back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ceremony was simple, almost rushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was necessary, as they didn't know when the leader of Evil Spirit Legion would arrive, so they couldn't afford to waste time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne didn't mind the simplicity. She strode forward proudly, looking down at the crowd with an air of superiority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just like that? So sudden!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Smith is becoming the head of the Smith family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Congratulations to Ms. Smith on inheriting the Smith family, and to Sir Smith on his well-deserved retirement..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, yes, congratulations to Ms. Smith and Sir Smith..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted in a buzz of excitement. After the initial shock wore off, they all scrambled to offer their congratulations.</span></p></div>
