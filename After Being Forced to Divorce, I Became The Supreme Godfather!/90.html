        <h1>Chapter 89 All-Out Battle</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's crisis took Anthony by surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, he had to change his strategy from a conservative fight while waiting for support to an all-out battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Anthony so resolute, Anne, not far away, shouted in anger, "What a stubborn fool!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Carolyn is about to die. Why are you still trying to be a hero?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The effects of the drug in your body must be about to wear off, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Without the support of the drugs, you're no different from a bag of trash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Foster didn't mind your insolent behavior and treated you leniently, yet you still want to resist. You truly deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she said to Mason, "Mr. Foster, please don't waste your time on this fool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I suggest you kill him now, raze the Turner Manor to the ground, and I will loyally serve you in the future...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If there's an opportunity, I am willing to replace the Turner family. The vast Yoland will revere you above all..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne was surprisingly ambitious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Replacing the Turner family was something Anne wouldn't have dared to think about in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now that Carolyn was near death, everything had changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Carolyn was dead, the Turner family would be doomed, and Yoland would be under their control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right!" Seeing Anne say this, Alvin was not to be outdone, saying, "Mr. Foster, quickly kill Anthony. The Blake family will swear to follow you! After destroying the Turner family, Yoland will be yours!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their seemingly ordinary acts of showing loyalty actually concealed a subtle competition between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin was very worried that Anne would win Mason's favor, thereby taking control of Yoland in the future, leaving him unable to take the lead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could not tolerate a woman being stronger than him. The future of Yoland could only be decided by him, Alvin, and the Blake family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To speak of it, they were engaged, but the marriage was nothing more than a bond of interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Anne was too domineering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she were to rule Yoland, his status would certainly be lower than that of a mouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, he had to be loyal to Mason, and he had to show even more loyalty than Anne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alvin was unaware that this statement had caused Anne's displeasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the Smith family, Anne would rather die than marry Alvin, this loser.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the Smith family controlled Yoland, the Blake family would be nothing more </span><span>than a worm in her eyes, let alone Alvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne snorted inwardly, casting a contemptuous glance at Alvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're a fighter. Fine!" Mason completely ignored the two of them and stared intently at Anthony, shouting sternly, "Since you are so stubborn, don't blame me for being impolite. Prepare to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After letting out a sudden roar, Mason charged forward without slowing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this time, a fiercely menacing aura erupted from Mason's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wide black robe fluttered in the wind, completely covering Mason's limbs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ordinary people could probably only see a rapidly approaching black whirlwind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, with the enhancement of Devil Eye, Anthony caught sight of Mason's hands transforming into sharp claws beneath the black robe!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flash of cold light that flickered across the claws made them appear like the scythe of Death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Anthony, who had been kicked, lay motionless, curled up in the corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Covered in dusts and wounds, he seemed very exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Anthony remain still, Anne sneered, "Just as I thought, the effects of his potion have worn off..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before Anne could finish her sentence, Anthony, from the corner, pulled out an M9 submachine gun, pointed the muzzle at Mason's forehead, and pulled the trigger forcefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gunshots were rapid and fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A series of sparks flashed across Mason's face, followed by billowing black smoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The M9 submachine gun was quite powerful, but for a Level B metahuman, it was not very effective.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, Anthony also knew that even if he emptied the entire clip, it wouldn't cause any substantial harm to Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the dense hail of bullets had considerable power, at the very least forcing Mason to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bullets may not be fatal to Mason, but being hit in the face unexpectedly still hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The key point was that Mason, a Level B metahuman, was actually forced to retreat by an ordinary gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a great humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason could no longer tolerate it, roaring, "Damn! I'll tear you apart!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason let out a howl to the sky, leaped into the air, and pounced on Anthony like a wolf attacking a sheep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of his claws was enough to tear through steel plates and shatter hard rocks!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Anthony was not only unafraid but also secretly sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason he used the M9 submachine gun wasn't because it was his last means of attack, but to enrage Mason, waiting for him to lose control!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Mason charged over with blazing fury, Anthony secretly gathered strength in his right leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the moment Mason pounced down, he seized the opportunity and used Killing Kick with perfect timing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kick was precise and powerful. However, just as Anthony believed he was about to win, the warning sound of the Devil Eye rang in his mind once again.</span></p></div>
