        <h1>Chapter 136 A Golden Opportunity</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd's chatter was cut off by Anthony's words, which hit like a thunderbolt out of the blue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Holy shit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the crowd fell dead silent, and everyone was struck dumb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes instinctively darted to Anne's face before inevitably shifting to Alvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Begging Anthony to fuck her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And after getting engaged to Alvin? How messed up was that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bullshit! You're full of crap!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd's piercing stares infuriated Alvin. His eyes burning with rage, he roared, "You bastard! You son of a bitch! If you dare spout any more nonsense, I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nonsense?" Anthony let out a sneer. "Whether it's nonsense or not, why don't you ask your fiancee?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" Alvin bellowed, his face contorted with fury. "Do you think I don't know? You've been married for three years, and you haven't even touched her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does this kind of thing even need to be asked?" he added with a dismissive wave of his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin was fuming with rage, but Anthony remained unfazed, as calm as ever. He spoke with a casual smile. "How am I supposed to know there's a mole on the inside of her thigh?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or that there's a scar below her left breast? Oh, and she also mentioned how every time, you're soft as a pillow, no fun at all. Am I right, my dear ex-wife?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Anthony deliberately turned his head and shot Anne a lewd grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne, now wholly enraged, snapped, "If you say one more word, I'll cut out your tongue myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? Don't want me to talk?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony chuckled, clearly enjoying himself. "So, does that mean you're admitting you begged me to fuck you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You! That's a lie!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne was flustered, denying fiercely. "You're nothing but trash! Stop spewing nonsense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her words faltered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne tried her best to explain, but Alvin's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was absolutely right!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mole on Anne's inner thigh was in the most private, hidden spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way anyone could see it unless she was completely undressed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The critical issue was Alvin knew deep down that he genuinely couldn't satisfy Anne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the harsh truth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lies might not always hurt, but the truth could cut like a blade!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As this thought crossed his mind, Alvin's eyes began to redden, and he instinctively turned to Anne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Anne was desperately trying to defend herself, but her frantic excuses came off as weak and unconvincing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the gaze of the crowd, Anne was visibly panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The problem was, she had knelt before Anthony in the past&mdash;completely naked, no less.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's brutal honesty left her no room to hide. Who could withstand such a blow?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony! You bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Anne flustered beyond measure, Ben, the head of security, shouted angrily, "How dare you smear Ms. Smith like this in front of everyone? I'll beat you to death </span><span>for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Ben leaped forward, crossing several yards in an instant as he charged at Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben was no lightweight. His attack came with explosive force and overwhelming momentum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony couldn't help but sneer internally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This punk had bullied him plenty back in the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Anthony was about to make his move, Dariel took a step forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That single movement from Dariel, before he even acted, was enough to make the charging Ben tremble in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the captain of the Turner family's security and a Metahuman!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Ben, with all his arrogance, knew full well that Dariel was considered one of Yoland's most powerful fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel could kill him with ease, so he didn't dare to make a move against Dariel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, while he feared Dariel, he had no such fear for Anthony. Stopping in his tracks, he sneered coldly, "Hmph! Pathetic loser.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dragging along a dog from the Turner family, and you're acting all high and mighty?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're even half a man, tell him to step aside, and let's settle this one-on-one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck! You're asking for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dog from the Turner family? The moment those words left Ben's mouth, Dariel's face darkened with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stand down!" Anthony ordered, raising his hand before Dariel could make a move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Johnson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Dariel immediately fell silent and stepped back respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ben!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Dariel step back, Alvin's eyes bulged with rage as he shouted, "Destroy him! No, kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne joined in with the command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's words had thoroughly enraged them both.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Captain, let me handle this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Dariel backed down, Timothy's face lit up with excitement as he strode forward. "Without the Turner family's protection, he's nothing but trash."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Captain, why use a sledgehammer to crack a nut? This loser isn't even worth your time. I can take care of him myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With all eyes on them, everyone was eager to prove themselves, and Timothy was no exception.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, as he'd said, Anthony was just a worthless nobody! It was practically a golden opportunity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben was thinking the same thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Timothy had already volunteered, he simply smirked and said, "Fine, he's all yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy said excitedly, "Don't worry, Captain. He's just a junkie! Taking him down will be like taking candy from a baby!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey! Anthony! Are you ready to die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy's eyes blazed with confidence and fury as he glared at Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, he was the Smith family's vice-captain, but moments ago, Dariel had kicked him flying like a ragdoll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That humiliation in front of everyone had stung!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't dare lash out at Dariel, but Anthony? That nobody wasn't even worth considering as a threat!</span></p></div>
