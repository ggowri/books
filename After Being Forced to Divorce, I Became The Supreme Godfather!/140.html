        <h1>Chapter 139 Don't Waste It</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben's breakthrough left everyone stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted in praise, almost elevating Ben and the Smith family to legendary status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne stood tall in the crowd, her pride swelling as she called out to Anthony, "If you're scared, Anthony, there's still time to kneel and beg for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm generous. My earlier offer still stands! Kneel and beg, and your life will be spared."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Anne walked outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They faced each other from a distance, with Anne deliberately taking a commanding posture as if ready to accept Anthony's submission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you waiting for, you worthless fool? Kneel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Smith is showing you mercy, giving you chance after chance. Don't waste it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right! You're about to die, just kneel already!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kneel now, it's better than dying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's appearance stirred up the crowd once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emboldened by Ben's status as a Warrior, they pressed closer, eager to witness Anthony's submission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Anthony threw his head back in laughter. After a moment, he addressed Anne, "Funny thing. My earlier words still stand, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said you will beg me to fuck you. If you want to kneel now, I won't stop you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, Anne exploded with rage, her eyes blazing as she screamed, "Ben! Kill him! Kill him now! Tear him apart!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben's eyes blazed with fury. "Loser! Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thunderous roar, Ben charged at Anthony once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his rage, each of Ben's footsteps shattered the floor beneath him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His rampage kicked up clouds of dust, his killing intent palpable in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The true power of a Warrior was absolutely terrifying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground trembled, sending spectators scrambling backward in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thunder Fist!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After his wild charge, Ben's fist shot upward like a rocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his power surged, his fist seemed to grow even larger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now the size of a punching bag, his fist was wrapped in a deadly aura that could split stones and create sonic booms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thunder Fist? Is that a Warrior technique?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! Anthony is just a worthless trash, but at least Ben's giving him the honor of dying to a real technique."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, dying to a move like that he should count himself lucky..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Warrior's technique allowed them to compress their power through their meridians before releasing it in a devastating burst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ben unleashed his Thunder Fist, the crowd gasped in amazement, confident that this would be Anthony's end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony remained frozen in place, appearing stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, though, he was contemplating whether to test out a combat technique of his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why not?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Anthony quickly selected a specific combat skill from his mental repertoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that Anthony was being slow. Ben's movements were just laughably sluggish to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even without activating his Devil Eye, Ben's movements appeared to Anthony like a slow-motion movie scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap in their abilities was just too vast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After his breakthrough, Ben was barely a Level A Warrior, while Anthony was a solid Level B Warrior!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, Anthony's combat experience and mastery of various fighting techniques far exceeded Ben's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Super Fist!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his casual demeanor, Anthony's movements were anything but slow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ben's fist came flying in, Anthony met it head-on with his punch, clean and precise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You worthless piece of trash! You're asking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Anthony dare to meet his punch directly, Ben let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony must be insane! What's he thinking?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He dares to go fist-to-fist with Ben? Doesn't he know Ben's a boxing champion?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, Ben just reached his peak. That punch of his must pack twenty years of training behind it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben sneered as the crowd buzzed with similar comments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the whispers reached their peak, Anthony's fist came crashing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The collision of fists thundered like a sonic boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What followed was the sickening crunch of breaking bones and an agonized scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Argh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone watched in shock as Ben went flying backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A spray of blood followed his trajectory through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's punch had been so devastating that it had shattered Ben's fist, broken his hand, and left blood everywhere!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet there stood Anthony, precisely as before, not having moved an inch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The punch had happened so fast that barely anyone had seen how it went down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All they knew was that Ben, who had confidently unleashed his Thunder Fist with full force, had been sent flying by a single counter-punch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben was a legitimate Warrior!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One round and his arm was brutally broken?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn't this the same as being crippled?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Smith family had finally produced a Warrior, and before they could even bask in the glory for a few minutes, he was ruined!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And to make matters worse, the one who crippled Ben was a notorious loser!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd, which had been buzzing with gossip and schadenfreude just moments before, fell instantly silent as if someone had flipped a switch. You could hear a pin drop.</span></p></div>
