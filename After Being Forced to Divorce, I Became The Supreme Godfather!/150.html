        <h1>Chapter 149 Escape</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's face darkened, and he pretended to be surprised and asked, "Who are you? How dare you meddle in my business?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur said, "I am Aaron Hastings from Draconic Shield!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm here to kill you on behalf of the Smith family! Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur came with great momentum, waved his hand, and rushed towards Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony countered the opponent's moves and refused to retreat. For a moment, the dust was flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aaron? The boss of Draconic Shield?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So strong! It seems that this he is even stronger than the Black Cloak."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, it seems like Anthony is going to lose the fight..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After more than a dozen rounds, Anthony gradually fell into a disadvantage. Arthur became unstoppable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne finally breathed a sigh of relief and sneered, "This time, Anthony will be </span><span>killed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin was also still in shock and nodded, "If that's the case, the money is worth it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can kill Anthony and also win over such a master."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the two were talking, Anthony became anxious and shouted angrily, then seemed to use all his strength to punch out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This punch forced Arthur to retreat. And then, Anthony seemed to be about to run away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't let him get away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Anthony was about to run away, Anne became anxious and shouted, "Mr. Hastings, kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He can't get away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur smiled coldly, and then quickly chased after Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Anthony's speed was so fast that he almost rushed out of the Smith Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Arthur trembled, and then howled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately afterwards, his speed increased several times in an instant. In a blink of an eye, he caught up with the running Anthony and kicked him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce kick, Anthony was kicked several feet away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Anthony used the force of this kick to leap a few hundred feet forward and rushed out of the Smith Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Werewolf?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hastings is a werewolf? No wonder he is so strong..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Metahuman! I've heard that everyone in Draconic Shield has special skills..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur howled. And the crowd was shocked once again and started discussing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after Anthony rushed out of the Smith Manor, Dariel rushed over. Without saying a word, Dariel burst out with all his strength and stopped Arthur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two fought and retreated, but Anthony had already disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aaron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Turner family will not let this matter go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel also imitated Anthony and fled after saying a cruel word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Coward!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur cursed angrily in the direction where Anthony and Dariel were fleeing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hastings is awesome! So strong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Metahuman is indeed powerful. Mr. Hastings is so majestic..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We are finally not afraid of Anthony. If he dares to come again, we will beat him to death..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony fled in panic, and Dariel was also driven away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a deafening cheer from the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur stood proudly, like a god, enjoying the cheers and admiration of the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Hastings..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most excited person must be Anne. She walked over quickly and smiled charmingly at Aaron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur said, "You are welcome. I'm just doing what I promised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony has escaped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, he won't dare to come back in a short time. I'll take my leave now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Arthur prepared to take his people away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait a moment..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Anne got anxious and pulled him back, saying, "Mr. Hastings, why are you so anxious? Can we talk about the next step of cooperation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur pretended to be confused and turned around to ask, "What do you mean? Don't you think the cost is too high?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne smiled helplessly and said, "Mr. Hastings, we can talk about it, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur shook his head decisively and said solemnly, "Five hundred million dollars a year. No room for negotiation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne was stunned for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cost was outrageous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, everyone had seen Arthur's strength. Anthony, who defeated the Black Cloak and killed many people, was just defeated by Arthur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Arthur was a Metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, Anthony escaped, not died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If one day Anthony returned, and Arthur was not there, the Smith family would suffer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cost was ridiculously high, but this amount of money could save the Smith family from disaster. It was actually not a loss.</span></p></div>
