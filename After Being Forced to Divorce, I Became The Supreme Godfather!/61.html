        <h1>Chapter 60 The Golden Finger</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, what exactly are you trying to pull here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me tell you something, those of us who serve the Turner family have never been subjected to this kind of humiliation! If you can't give us a proper explanation today, we won't stand for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin, standing next to Vincent, seized the moment to shout loudly under Vincent's signal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the leader of the estate's staff, Calvin's words acted like a spark igniting dry tinder. The crowd's anger quickly flared up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calvin's right! We demand an explanation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, we'll never let this go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you treating us like criminals? Explain yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The collective outrage of over four hundred people shook the square, their synchronized chants reverberating through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Rose began to lose her composure, whispering anxiously, "Anthony, what's your plan? If you provoke everyone, I won't be able to defend you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel added nervously, "Anthony, are you sure about this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, unperturbed, smiled calmly. "Relax. This is just a routine inspection."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, his gaze locked onto Calvin, the instigator. With a cold smirk, Anthony asked, "Ms. Carolyn Turner ordered all members of the Turner Manor to assemble. Calvin, why haven't you joined the lineup?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or have you, as a steward, begun to see yourself as the master?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin bristled with anger. "What nonsense! Don't twist the facts! I have always been loyal to the Turner family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's smile turned sharper. "Loyal to the Turner family? Or just to Vincent? Fine, you can stay where you are. But now, raise your left hand for inspection."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin instinctively stepped back, gritting his teeth. "You're doing this to humiliate me! Ms. Carolyn Turner, I've served this family for thirty years with unwavering loyalty. Are you really going to let this lowlife insult me like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't put a stop to him, it will break everyone's hearts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd of 400 roared in unison, "Ms. Carolyn Turner, punish him! Give us </span><span>justice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn hesitated, her expression troubled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she seemed to understand what Anthony was aiming for. In a low, firm voice, she used her internal energy to transmit her thoughts directly to Anthony's mind. "Young man, tell me honestly, do you have evidence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sound bypassed everyone else, landing solely in Anthony's ears. Those around them only saw Carolyn's lips move slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony smiled and responded with his Devil Eye, "Ms. Carolyn Turner, I understand the burden you bear as the head of the Turner family. I know your actions against me weren't personal; you just want to maintain stability for the family. I respect your struggle. Even if you decide to kill me today, I wouldn't hold it against you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now, I'm certain that the mastermind behind hiring the Evil Spirit Legion to assassinate Ms. Turner comes from within the family. If we don't root out this poison, the Turner family could fall apart in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're unwilling to proceed, I'll stop the investigation right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's sharp, perceptive eyes softened slightly, her killing intent replaced with a newfound respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, she realized she had underestimated this young man's depth and understanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this critical moment, not only were hundreds of Turner family members watching her, but the many prestigious guests from across Yoland were also observing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly realized that this was a major transformation within the Turner family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether to press forward with this transformation was entirely in her hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Carolyn, just give the order, and I'll kill him immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent interjected, trying to push her decision. "Don't worry. I'll make sure to uncover the real culprit behind Rose's assassination attempt!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn paused, her face unreadable. Then, in a steady tone, she said, "Calvin, follow Anthony's instructions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Carolyn Turner..." Calvin's face went pale with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's voice turned icy. "What are you afraid of?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words hit Calvin like a hammer. He froze, his face draining of color. Unable to argue further, he clenched his jaw and slowly pulled out the hand he had been keeping hidden in his sleeve. He raised it hesitantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's eyes narrowed as sunlight glinted off something on Calvin's hand. There was a golden finger cap on his left pinky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's expression brightened. "Take off the finger cap!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You!" Calvin shouted angrily, his voice trembling. "You're humiliating me on purpose!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've served the Turner family with all my heart, and this injury was sustained in their service. Sir Turner himself granted me this golden finger cap as an honor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can insult me, Anthony, but you have no right to insult Sir Turner's dignity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This finger cap stays unless Sir Turner himself says otherwise!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony turned to Rose. "Sir Turner? He's your grandfather, isn't he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose nodded. "Yes. But my grandfather has gone into seclusion in the tower. He won't </span><span>come out easily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustrated but determined, Anthony sent an urgent telepathic message to Carolyn. "Based on the assassin's confession, the employer only has four fingers on their left hand. I must confirm Calvin's hand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn gasped aloud, her eyes wide with shock as they locked onto Calvin.</span></p></div>
