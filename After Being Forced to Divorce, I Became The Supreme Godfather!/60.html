        <h1>Chapter 59 Gathering Everyone</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Dariel finished speaking, Anthony gave Vincent no chance to retort. Instead, he raised his voice and declared, "So that's how it is! Mr. Vincent Turner, you deliberately sent Dariel away and failed to assign anyone to pick up Rose. Was it all to create an opportunity for the assassin?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've been obstructing my investigation because you're afraid the truth will come out! As Rose's brother, you plotted to kill her. Do I even need to say why? It's obvious. You wanted to seize power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because after tonight's birthday banquet, Rose will officially be named the successor. Your chances will vanish completely! Am I wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's rapid-fire accusations struck Vincent like a series of fireworks exploding in his face. The usually composed Vincent was stunned into silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never taken someone like Anthony seriously, only to now find himself struggling to respond to the young man's sharp words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nonsense!" Calvin jumped in, pointing a finger at Anthony. "You're just a desperate lab rat who risks his life for scraps! How dare you spew such lies to slander Mr. Vincent Turner!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was there and heard everything. Mr. Vincent Turner clearly instructed Dariel to send others to the mines while he personally led a team to pick up Ms. Turner! Dariel twisted his orders and now tries to shift the blame back onto him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin continued, "Ms. Carolyn Turner, Mr. Vincent Turner, I believe Dariel and Anthony are the true culprits! Don't forget, Dariel is also a Lupine Metahuman, the same kind as those mutant werewolves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly!" Vincent, regaining his composure, added loudly, "Aunt Carolyn, Anthony, and Dariel are colluding! One infiltrated Rose's side, and the other deliberately delayed reinforcements. Their goal is clear: to win Rose's trust and control the Turner family through her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Carolyn, what are you waiting for? Kill them both!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their argument seemed plausible, even more convincing than Anthony's earlier claims.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin, eager to see Anthony eliminated, chimed in, "Ms. Carolyn, Mr. Vincent Turner is absolutely right! Anthony is a master manipulator who preys on women's emotions. You must be on guard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne said, "I can attest to that! The first time I met Anthony, I was being harassed by thugs. He stepped in to 'rescue' me, and I was so grateful I married him, falling right into his trap. Looking back, it's clear that so-called heroics were all part of his scheme!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first time Anthony met her, it was indeed because she was being harassed by a few drunken thugs, and Anthony had stepped in to help her drive them away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never imagined that today, it would become evidence in Anne's attempt to slander Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Anthony's ex-wife, her words carried weight, and the room began to waver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's eyes turned to Anthony, cold and sharp like daggers, brimming with killing intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose, anxious, interjected, "Aunt Carolyn, it's not like that! I believe Anthony!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn snorted. "I made a promise to let him investigate, and I won't go back on my word halfway. I hereby declare the first round of investigation void!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's your next move?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony smirked. "If Ms. Carolyn Turner refuses to believe my accusations against Mr. Vincent Turner, then I'll provide irrefutable evidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My next step is simple: gather all members of the Turner family in the square. I'll interrogate them one by one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent exploded. "Absolutely not! Anthony, who do you think you are to summon our family members like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Carolyn, you can't let him mess around like this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's gaze darkened as she studied Anthony. "Are you sure about this? I warn you, if you waste everyone's time and fail to find anything, each one of them will take a swing at you with a blade."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony responded loudly, "I'm doing this to help the Turner family uncover the culprit. If you won't cooperate, the wager ends here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn, taken aback by Anthony's boldness, found herself at a loss for words. Her frustration bubbled over, and she barked, "Fine! Relay my order. Everyone is to gather in the square within ten minutes. Anyone who disobeys will be executed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's iron grip on the family was undeniable. Her command sent ripples through Turner Manor as young and old alike hurried to comply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, more than 400 members of the Turner family stood in formation in the square, a dark mass of people creating an imposing sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose leaned toward Anthony and whispered nervously, "What are you planning? Are you confident?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, calm and composed, shouted, "Now, listen carefully. Raise your left hands, all of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why our left hands?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why should we listen to a stranger?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confused murmurs spread through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, unfazed, pulled out his M9 sub-machine gun and fired a volley into the air. "Anyone who disobeys will be treated as the assassin and executed on the spot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden show of force was effective. Though baffled, everyone obediently raised their left hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd stood in eight rows, 50 people per line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony began inspecting each person, one by one, from the first row to the last. But to his disappointment, everyone's left hands were intact. None matched the description of the black-cloaked figure with only four fingers, as described by the captured mutant werewolf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony frowned, thinking to himself, "Could it be that the four-fingered black-cloaked figure wasn't from within the Turner family after all?"</span></p></div>
