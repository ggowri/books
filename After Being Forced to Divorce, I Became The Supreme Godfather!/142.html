        <h1>Chapter 141 Kill Him</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben's wails were heart-wrenching!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne couldn't help but feel dazed. A Warrior was no match for Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Are the drugs from the Godfather Research Institute really that powerful?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This drug turns a loser into a Warrior?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So scary."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For an ordinary person like Anne, this was simply unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will you beg me or not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony stood proudly among the crowd, looked at Anne, and asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Anne was in a state of confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's strength made it a little difficult for her to accept it for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because in her heart, Anthony was a loser, a man who deserved to die, a man who should beg for mercy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he had transformed into such a powerful person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be afraid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when Anne was at a loss, Alvin came over and whispered, "Don't forget that the more powerful the drug, the stronger the side effects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, being strong for a short time doesn't mean anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne took a deep breath and nodded. "Yes, I almost forgot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The power of the drug, after all, is not his own power. He is just a powerful loser..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne frowned and said worriedly, "But it would be disgraceful of us not to teach him a lesson in public."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin said, "Don't worry. He will definitely die today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled and glanced at Anne proudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was proud because he knew Ben was no match for Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the beginning, Alvin didn't know that Ben had successfully became a Warrior, so he was certain that Ben would lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Anthony relied on drugs, his enhanced power was obvious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben couldn't beat him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin was surprised that Ben became a Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he was still certain that Ben was no match for Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was indeed the case. And what Alvin was waiting for was Ben's defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, ever since they got engaged, Anne had always been superior to him and had taken the lead in everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Alvin was the heir of the Blake family. And the status of the Blake family was much higher than that of the Smith family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, Alvin was a grown man. He didn't want to let Anne take the lead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, Alvin felt angry. And now was the time for him to vent his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Smith family couldn't stop Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the Blake family could do it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Black Cloak!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After glancing at Anne, Alvin held his head high and waved to the Black Cloak not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Cloak understood and strode over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin said, "Kill Anthony, and I'll reward you one hundred million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Cloak grinned and said respectfully, "You are too kind. It is my duty to help you solve your problems."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having said that, the Black Cloak still had a greedy look on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Cloak had said that his duty was to protect the Blake family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the Black Cloak did not hesitate, jumped up, rushed towards Anthony and shouted, "Loser, do you still remember me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony looked back and couldn't help laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Black Cloak!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony wanted to fight with the Blake family's Shadow Sentinel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the beginning, Anthony caused a scene at the engagement banquet, after which the Black Cloak attacked with great strength and almost caught him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Anthony hadn't been quick-witted and used his pistol to force the Black Cloak to stop, he would have been in trouble!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, the Black Cloak left a very deep impression on Anthony!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or rather, it was the power of the Warrior that impressed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Anthony's first contact with a Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was surprised by the Warrior's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, times had changed. This time, Anthony wanted to teach him a lesson!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony turned around and smiled, "It's you, the old guy who was stopped by my gun..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brat! I'm going to kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Anthony could finish, the Black Cloak became furious, shouted, and approached him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be precise, the Black Cloak had been looking for an opportunity to teach Anthony, this ignorant guy, a lesson!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reward was secondary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike Ben, the Black Cloak was quick. As soon as he finished speaking, he shook his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Warrior!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Blake family's Shadow Sentinel has been famous for a long time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. It is said that as early as ten years ago, he became a Warrior and has a lot of experience."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony is ignorant. He dares to speak so recklessly in front of the Black Cloak."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph! He is smart. He was going to die anyway, better at the hands of the Black Cloak than by the Evil Spirit Legion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It can be considered that he was brave enough to resist, and his death was worthy..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they saw the Black Cloak taking action, everyone exclaimed in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew this was a Shadow Sentinel that had been famous for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, his strength was extraordinary. And he was far superior to Ben, the new Shadow Sentinel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Must kill him..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Ben, who was not far away, wiped the blood off his face and screamed crazily.</span></p></div>
