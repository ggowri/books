        <h1>Chapter 43 Trap of Seduction</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was she really going to dance?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony stared, captivated by Jane's enchanting figure, his eyes widening in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized she was preparing to set a seductive trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he found it slightly odd that Jane was using her beauty to lure the werewolf, he quickly became entranced by her movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her dance seemed to possess a certain magic, transporting Anthony to another realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His thoughts began to fade, and he found himself losing touch with reality, feeling as if Jane was the ruler of this world&mdash;and of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but inch closer to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the jarring sound of rattling chains jolted him back to reality. He turned to see the werewolf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he saw shocked him even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolf's mouth hung open, drooling, and his eyes shifted from excitement to a vacant stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Missy, that's amazing. Dance! Dance some more!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come here. Come into my arms!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice trailed off, leaving him looking utterly foolish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of alertness hit Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that Jane was employing a seduction spell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But more than that, it seemed like a method of mind control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was weaving mind control techniques into her dance. With her alluring figure </span><span>and captivating presence, she effortlessly lowered her opponent's defenses, ensnaring them in her meticulously crafted mental trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Anthony understood what Jane meant when she warned him to control himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rushing to regain control, Anthony felt his efforts falter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In desperation, he summoned his Devil Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It deduced that Jane was a spiritual metahuman and that the Host could utilize Energy-absorbing Breathing to clear the mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a wave of nausea and dizziness, Anthony leaned against the wall and silently practiced the Energy-absorbing Breathing technique. Gradually, he calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With curiosity, he observed as Jane continued to manipulate the werewolf's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The creature appeared like a marionette, stiff and unresponsive, his eyes dully fixed on Jane as she moved gracefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she danced closer, Jane gently brushed her fingers across the werewolf's face. He looked like a child being tenderly stroked by his mother, revealing a mix of excitement and yearning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good boy," Jane purred. "Tell me, what's your position in the Evil Spirit Legion?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who sent you this time?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you want to kill Rose?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The interrogation unfolded in this unique manner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Anthony, having steadied his mind with Energy-absorbing Breathing, felt overwhelmed by Jane's enchanting voice, wanting nothing more than to comply with her every command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a brief moment, he wished he could give her everything he owned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolf responded, "I'm a low-level assassin from the Evil Spirit Legion in the Southwest Camp, codenamed XN-601.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My two companions and I usually train in the Virstino Mountains, waiting for the organization to call us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, the organization sent a letter instructing us to meet a black-robed man with four fingers on his left hand&mdash;he would provide us with our mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We would follow his instructions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't remember anything else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's mental control was too potent for the werewolf to resist. His voice trailed off, his eyelids drooping, until he finally slumped forward, snoring heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sigh, Jane released her spell, looking somewhat fatigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Anthony, surprise etched on her face. "Mr. Johnson, even though I didn't target you, my power affects everyone in the room when I use it. I didn't expect your concentration to be so strong that you remained unaffected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're gifted, Mr. Johnson, and have a bright future ahead. I've chosen the right person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony secretly felt ashamed. If not for the Devil Eye and Energy-absorbing Breathing, he might have lost control in front of Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly asked, "Why did he fall asleep? What about the four-fingered black-robed man? He must know how to find him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's smile turned bitter. "That's all I can do for now. The werewolf's willpower is too </span><span>feeble. It's quite impressive that he held out for this long under my mental control. We'll need to wait for him to regain his mental strength before we can conduct a second interrogation, and I'm afraid that won't be until dawn at the earliest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Johnson, would you like to rest for now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Anthony felt anxious, there was little he could do. Forcing the interrogation would only result in the werewolf's death, which would be counterproductive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded, saying, "Alright, just keep an eye on him and update me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry about me; I'll head to Rose's room to rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Johnson," Jane called out, producing a black chip. "Inside are skills and knowledge I've meticulously gathered. They're not available on the market. This is my gift to you, and I hope it proves useful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skills and knowledge?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were exactly what Anthony desperately needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He now faced a perilous and complicated situation. The Devil Eye was still only version 1.0, and he had no idea when it would be upgraded to version 2.0. Due to his limited qualifications, he couldn't buy many items from the Dragon Ring Store.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, improving himself through other channels was crucial at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Anthony knew that whatever Jane had collected must be extraordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he activated his Devil Eye and examined the contents of the chip.</span></p></div>
