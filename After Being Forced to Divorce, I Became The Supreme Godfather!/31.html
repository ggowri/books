        <h1>Chapter 30 The Hunt's Dawn</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Discerning items from a distance is a level above just sniffing out herbs!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Johnson, I've clearly underestimated you! You're indeed a master at identifying spiritual medicines!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Rose kissed him, a boldness washed over her. Her cheeks flushed prettily, and she gazed at Anthony with a joy that sparkled in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thousand-year-old Eldergleam Fungus was indeed a treasure of immense value.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, the fungus itself was of little concern to her. What truly mattered was the confirmation that her trust had not been misplaced; she hadn't been deceived after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She murmured, "Anthony is not here to harm me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's a maestro in the realm of spiritual medicine, and by gifting me such a rare elixir, he's shown the depth of his sincerity towards me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her beautiful eyes brimmed with affection. She felt that even if Anthony knelt down and proposed right then, she might struggle to say no.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's heart swelled with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second step of the Chosen Path was to win Rose's trust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed the goal was closer than ever!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No further proof was needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one in the room doubted the authenticity of the Eldergleam Fungus in Anthony's hand anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most devastated was Anne. Her face paled, and her fists clenched so tightly that her nails dug into her flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had braved humiliation, stripping off her clothes and kneeling before Anthony, believing her sacrifice would sway him and draw him into her carefully laid trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her efforts were for naught. Not only did she fail, but the family's prized thousand-year-old Eldergleam Fungus was now in Anthony's possession for a mere five million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of driving a wedge between Anthony and Rose, her actions only deepened Rose's respect and affection for Anthony!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose's kiss on Anthony's forehead felt like a cold spike piercing the hearts of everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were deeply uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin, in particular, had eyes that were bloodshot, seething with an intense fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at the thousand-year-old Eldergleam Fungus Anthony had acquired for five million dollars and then at the patchwork item he had paid fifty million dollars for, </span><span>wishing he could find a hole to crawl into.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How utterly humiliating!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, this gift is too precious, I can't accept it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose exclaimed, her voice tinged with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony smiled warmly, "Flowers are for beauties, and elixirs are for medical immortals. This elixir serves no purpose for me. I give it to you to nourish your body, so it can fulfill its greatest potential. Otherwise, it's no better than a blade of grass!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under his earnest gaze, Rose felt her heart race. Though he hadn't declared his love, his words resonated more deeply than any declaration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated and replied, "If you want me to accept it, fine. I'll give you 100 million dollars. If you refuse, then I refuse as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A flawless thousand-year-old Eldergleam Fungus is priceless. Even at 100 million dollars, I feel like I'm taking advantage of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony chuckled. "Alright. I happen to be a bit short on funds, so I won't turn it down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen beamed. "Ms. Turner, I'll keep the Eldergleam Fungus for you and transfer the money right away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner, here is the Eldergleam Fungus. Our trip is complete. Let's return and rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With no more items of interest, Rose left with Anthony, returning to her quarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was meant to be a trap for Anthony had not only failed but had also elevated him to new heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone lost their enthusiasm, and the auction came to an abrupt end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll add another 100 million dollars!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoever kills Anthony will receive a bounty of 200 million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the member lounge, Alvin roared, his eyes bloodshot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Putting up a 200 million bounty for a man deemed a loser, cast out by his own wife, marks one of the most bizarre and twisted sagas in Yoland's history.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Assassin leaders from various factions were secretly mustering their forces, preparing to strike Anthony a fatal blow and claim the reward!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day was the final day of the three-day trading session at Dragon Guild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dragon Guild launched its marketplace, where all weapons and goods were available only in restricted numbers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On this day, Rose usually remained in the rest area, waiting for the time to pass and leave. The market's offerings, though invaluable to others, meant little to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such items held no appeal for her; she felt no need to purchase them for self-defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For her, her identity was the best protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this time, aware of Anthony's interest in the market, she took extra care with her appearance, dressing up meticulously in the early hours. With her arm linked through his, she arrived at the market brimming with enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her demeanor radiated the joy of a newlywed bride shopping with her beloved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony noticed numerous menacing glares within the crowd, aware that they were all lying in wait, eager for a chance to strike him down. But he found himself indifferent, too languid to give them any heed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they made their way into the market, it was like entering a valley overflowing with invaluable treasures: elegant swords, accurate pistols, powerful grenades, and mighty rockets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each item was authentic and tagged with prices lower than those on the black market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder everyone was in a frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the offerings were cold weapons like Dragonfang and firearms like the M9, but Anthony had no immediate need for these. Instead, with Rose by his side, he invested 10 million dollars in a cutting-edge bionic bulletproof vest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon laying eyes on Seraph's bionic suit, his interest was thoroughly piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The liquid bionic bulletproof vest required only a drop of his blood to activate. Once mixed, he could pour the blue liquid onto his hands, and it would spread rapidly, covering his entire body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would then seamlessly blend into his skin, undetectable to both sight and touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though it was expensive and costly to repair if damaged, the vest was a remarkable piece of technology.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Additionally, he purchased two bundles of high-explosive grenades, which he deemed more valuable than the M9 in certain situations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they knew it, the sun began to set, signaling the close of the market and the end of the three-day trading session at Dragon Guild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All members were required to leave on time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they prepared to depart, Anthony noticed Alvin leading a group of men standing at the gate, their eyes locked on him from a distance. Anthony knew that the true hunt was about to begin.</span></p></div>
