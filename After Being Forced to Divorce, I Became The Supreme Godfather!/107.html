        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne returned, and with her came not only Alvin but also about a dozen others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn ignored Anne and Alvin's words, instead raising an eyebrow as she looked at the group behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was pretty familiar with these people. They were the heads of various families in Yoland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of them held significant status and had not attended the Turner family's birthday </span><span>banquet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they had come with Anne, and they did not seem friendly at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Carolyn could speak, Dariel gritted his teeth and angrily said, "Anne, since you've sided with the Evil Spirit Legion, why have you come to the Turner Manor?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are not welcome here. Get out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, when the Turner family was in dire straits, Anne had urged everyone to side with Mason. Everyone remembered that incident vividly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne laughed with a haughty tone. "Not welcome? Who do you think you are?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To put it politely, you are the captain of the Turner Guards. But in reality, aren't you just a lackey?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner and Carolyn haven't spoken yet. Do you even have the right to speak?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel's face darkened, and he was about to retort, but Carolyn held him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said calmly, "It's just a petty person reveling in their moment of success. Treat it as barking. There's no need to pay attention."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Carolyn, Anne was nothing significant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for Anthony, with the Smith family's status in Yoland, Anne wouldn't even have the right to set foot in the Turner Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kicking someone when they were down was what petty, successful people loved to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn advised Dariel, and he said nothing more, only muttering angrily, "Bitch! How dare she disrespect Ms. Turner? I will teach her a lesson sooner or later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His anger wasn't because Anne insulted him but because she disrespected Carolyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Carolyn, you dare to insult me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of Dariel responding, Anne flew into a rage. She shouted, "The Turner family is on the brink of collapse, and you still dare to act high and mighty here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think you're still the head of the family? Once the Turner family is wiped out by Mr. Foster, let's see how you'll act as the head then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn sat on a messy rock, staring at her for a moment, and said, "Ms. Smith, you've returned and brought so many people with you. You must have some business, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's expression of anger stiffened visibly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had anticipated that Carolyn would explode in anger or scold her. What she didn't expect was Carolyn's calm demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even sitting amidst the ruins and looking quite disheveled, she still carried an air of elegance and authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, a nameless anger rose in Anne's heart, yet she didn't know why she was angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I have business."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glaring at Carolyn, Anne said haughtily, "Your manor is quite impressive. I plan to make some early arrangements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In a few days, I will establish a business alliance, and this place will become the headquarters of the alliance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Planning the Turner Manor? A business alliance? And the headquarters?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's casual remark contained a wealth of information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family hadn't fallen yet, and Anne was already so brazen. Was she planning to divide the Turner family's assets?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, the Turner family members all glared at Anne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If not for the werewolf army looming, they would have rushed over to tear her to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was not a hint of anger on Carolyn's face. Instead, she said, "Ms. Smith, you're quite quick, aren't you? In the time it takes to come and go, you're planning to take over Yoland?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne didn't detect the sarcasm in Carolyn's voice and proudly said, "Haven't you heard the saying, 'When one giant falls, many rise'?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You Turner family is courting disaster, and you don't allow us to make early plans?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn laughed dryly and simply ignored her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"On the brink of death, and you're still putting on airs," Anne mocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she addressed the werewolf army, "Fellow werewolves, Anthony is a trash who dares to challenge Mr. Foster. He's headed for certain death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, the Turner family is at its last gasp. Why don't you press your advantage and wipe them out once and for all?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This simple statement sent a shock through the werewolves, and their green eyes gradually burst with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "Yes. Why don't we take this opportunity to eliminate the Turner family once and for all? Mr. Foster is gone, but we are still here. Moreover, the Turner family no longer has the strength to fight. Isn't this a great opportunity?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking this, many werewolves silently emerged from cover and gathered ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing?" Dariel said in a horrified and deep voice, "Don't forget what your leader said. If Mr. Johnson wins, he will spare the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you planning to act on your own, violating your leader's orders?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Dariel finished speaking, the gathering werewolves clearly hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason had indeed said that before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, don't believe his nonsense." Anne strode over at an inopportune moment. "Mr. Foster said that to deceive Anthony. Think about it. How could Mr. Foster possibly miss such a good opportunity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And I believe Mr. Foster challenged Anthony to a duel to lure him away. Otherwise, he could have dueled Anthony right here at the Turner Manor, not in Phantom Hollow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He went to Phantom Hollow to buy you time. I think this is the perfect moment for you to strike."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did the werewolves find Anne's analysis reasonable, but Dariel and the Turner family were also greatly shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that they had fallen into a trap?</span></p></div>
