        <h1>Chapter 64 The Truth Unfolds</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Vincent humiliated in public, Calvin finally lost his composure. His expression darkened as he snapped, "Ms. Ronald, what is the meaning of this? Mr. Vincent Turner's admiration for you is a sign of respect! Even if you don't intend to marry him, you shouldn't mock him like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And as for Anthony, who disrupted this event and accused me of murder without proof, he's already as good as dead. Yet you claim to belong to him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't tell me you've fallen for that pretty face of his, too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's face turned cold. She stepped forward without hesitation and delivered a resounding slap across Calvin's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crisp sound left the entire gathering in stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin staggered, clutching his cheek in disbelief. "You dare strike me? This is the Turner family's territory, not your Dragon Guild!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane sneered. "You dared to call Mr. Johnson a dead man? I say you're the one with one foot in the grave! That slap was a small lesson before your end."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin covered his face, gritting his teeth as he said, "Ms. Carolyn Turner, even though she's with Dragon Group, we, the Turner family, as one of the oldest families in Yoland, you can't just stand by and let someone come to our door and humiliate us like this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't stand up for me today, it's the Turner family's reputation on the line!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn, visibly displeased, frowned. She, too, found Jane's behavior unusually erratic and disrespectful today. Carolyn said coldly, "Ms. Ronald, I demand an explanation. Why do you claim your gift will cost Vincent his life? And why do you say Calvin is as good as dead?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're acting out of caprice, the Turner family will not stand for such insults."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words revealed that she was already somewhat angered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family, with its hundreds of members, along with the high society guests attending the banquet, all widened their eyes and quietly watched Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Jane couldn't provide Carolyn with a perfect explanation, the Turner family might very well take action against her today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That would signal a confrontation between two of Yoland's most powerful factions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane snorted coldly, too lazy to bother with Carolyn. Instead, she smiled at Anthony and said, "Mr. Johnson, as per your instructions, the gift has been delivered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, may I reveal it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony slowly stood up. After Rose's treatment, he had fully regained his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he was energized and radiant. He strode over to the carriage, glanced around, and loudly declared, "You wanted proof, didn't you? Well, here it is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he suddenly yanked off the black cloth covering the carriage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Underneath it was a massive iron cage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, huddled in fear, was a half-wolf, half-human creature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly exposed to the light, it recoiled, letting out a nervous sound. Its crimson eyes, like those of a devil from the dark underworld, blinked in the sunlight, cautiously surveying the world around it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When it saw Anthony, it let out an enraged low growl, baring its sharp fangs and snarling as it lunged forward. Its body was stopped by the sturdy iron cage, and the chains fastened to it rattled, producing a deafening, shrill noise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A werewolf!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's one of the Evil Spirit Legion's werewolves! Anthony, watch out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel, instinctively protective, moved closer to Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane produced a ghostly whip and lashed it across the bars. The werewolf recoiled, its claws bleeding where the whip struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dare act up? Behave!" Jane shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the werewolf saw Jane, it reacted like a circus monkey seeing its trainer. Fear flashed in its eyes, and it quickly retreated into the cage, cowering and too scared to look up again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's one of the assassins! Ms. Turner, come look!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen cried out as she saw the werewolf in the cage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose hurried over and, after identifying it, gritted her teeth and said, "That's right! He's one of the three werewolves who tried to assassinate me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because Anthony fought to protect me, he failed. In the end, Dariel and his team arrived, and he fled in panic. I never imagined he would end up being captured by Ms. Ronald!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Ronald, thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane took Rose's hand and smiled mysteriously, saying, "Thank you for what? I told you, we're family. If anyone should be thanked, it's Mr. Johnson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose's face flushed. Jane had called her Anthony's family, but she hadn't agreed to marry him yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Anthony hadn't officially confessed his feelings to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shyly, she looked at Anthony and said, "I understand now. You mean this werewolf can identify the real mastermind who hired him, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony nodded with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen shouted, "Werewolf, tell us, was it Calvin who hired you to assassinate Ms. Turner?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Calvin hid behind Vincent and quickly concealed his left hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His actions spoke volumes. No need for the werewolf to identify him; everyone already knew he was the one who had contacted the werewolf, the one with the four fingers, the Black Cloak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's gaze turned sharp as two iron swords, and she gritted her teeth, saying, "I can't believe after all these years, the Turner family trusted you, only for you to show your true colors, daring to betray your master!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Speak! Was there someone who gave you orders?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have any other accomplices?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words pointed directly at Vincent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin and Vincent were in cahoots. If anyone had given the orders, it could only be Vincent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking back to what Anthony had said about Vincent wanting to seize the position of heir and what Jane had mentioned about the gift possibly costing Vincent his life, the answer was obvious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the crowd turned their eyes to Vincent, their gazes were a mix of shock, suspicion, and disdain.</span></p></div>
