        <h1>Chapter 56 Mind Your Dignity</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, are you alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Anthony stepped into the banquet hall, a familiar and delicate voice came out. He quickly looked up and saw Rose running toward him from the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lifted the hem of her gown, elegantly dressed, looking like a princess on the run.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She dashed toward Anthony, her eyes full of eagerness, like a young maiden seeing her lover after a long separation, ready to throw herself into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was genuinely thrilled as well. Seeing Rose again brought warmth, like a reunion after surviving a disaster. Instinctively, he opened his arms, preparing to embrace her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the eyes of everyone around them were forgotten. Only the two of them existed in each other's world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Helen stepped forward just in time, grabbing Rose's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they had truly embraced in front of so many people, the situation would have become far more complicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaving aside the crowd here, the lofty Carolyn, who held the life and death power of the Turner family, was undoubtedly watching from the shadows!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By stopping Rose, Helen was actually protecting her and Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner, Anthony is fine. There are a lot of people here, so please mind your image," Helen softly said while holding Rose's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose finally calmed her excitement. She looked at Anthony with teary eyes and said apologetically, "I'm sorry! I just found out about the injustice you suffered! It's all my fault! I was too late to learn the truth, and you've endured so much because of me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're my savior! Without you, I would've been killed by that mutated werewolf!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was filled with sorrow, so moving it seemed to resonate with everyone present. Coupled with her delicate, tear-streaked face, it stirred the hearts of many.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the bystanders, who had initially felt indifferent, began to sympathize with Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Rose's deep concern, Anthony felt that all his struggles had been worth it. Smiling warmly, he said, "You are the moon in the sky, and I am the frog on the ground. You live on the mountain peak, and I dwell in the valley depths. We are so different, separated by an unimaginable distance. To see you, how could I not endure a little hardship?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay. As long as you're safe, I'm content."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though his words were simple, the deep affection within them deeply moved Rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since their parting, she had thought of him constantly. Though they had been separated for only a short time, to her, it felt like an eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't care! Come with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly spoke and grabbed Anthony's hand, pulling him toward the seats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop right there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man dressed in black strode over, his face stern. "Rose, mind your behavior! You're a young lady of the Turner family with a special status. How can you be so casual with an unfamiliar man?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With so many people watching, this is utterly inappropriate! Let go of him at once!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was directed at Rose, but his icy gaze was fixed on Anthony, full of hostility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony smirked coldly. Judging by his demeanor and resemblance to Rose, this man likely held a high position in the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel leaned in and whispered, "That's Vincent Turner, Ms. Turner's cousin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony sneered. "You seem to have a problem with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch your tone!" Vincent barked. "Who do you think you are to deserve my attention?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Rose, he scolded, "Did you hear me? Let go of this man immediately! He doesn't belong in our world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose retorted angrily, "He's my friend and my savior! You have no right to talk about him like that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is my birthday banquet. I have every right to make my own decisions! Step aside! I'm taking him to sit with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nonsense!" Vincent bellowed. "The main seat at a Turner family banquet isn't for just anyone, especially not someone like this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As a Turner, you must know your responsibilities. Calvin, come here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Vincent Turner." From a distance, an elderly man in a bright red robe, </span><span>Calvin Butler, quickly walked over. He was tall and stooped slightly, his hands tucked inside his sleeves, and his face wore a seemingly eternal smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He appeared so polite and kind as if he would never offend anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to Anthony, there was something unsettling about him. Calvin's smile seemed carved into stone, giving him the appearance of a lifeless machine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony thought to himself, "What kind of person always wears a smile? Either someone with immense compassion or someone who hides daggers in their heart and sees human lives as trifles."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin undoubtedly belonged to the latter category.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And why were his hands hidden in his sleeves? Anthony's gaze instinctively lingered there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell Ms. Turner about the rules for Turner family girls," Vincent commanded coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bowing slightly, Calvin replied, "Of course, Mr. Vincent Turner." Turning to Rose, he said with a calm and polite tone, "The Turner family has strict traditions. Its daughters, above all, must uphold propriety. In both public and private, they must refrain from inappropriate behavior with unfamiliar men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner, please mind your dignity. Otherwise, it is the Turner family's honor that will be tarnished."</span></p></div>
