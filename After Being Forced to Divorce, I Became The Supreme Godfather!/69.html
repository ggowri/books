        <h1>Chapter 68 Wolves Howled</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the dire situation, Alvin gritted his teeth and said to Rose and Jane in fear, "Ms. Turner, Ms. Ronald, please show mercy. I will never dare to do it again. As long as you let me and the Blake family go, I will do anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne reacted and hurriedly said, "Ms. Turner, Ms. Ronald, please spare my life. If you let me go, I... I am willing to pay one hundred million dollars to atone for my sins."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose sneered, "You hurt Anthony. If you want to beg for mercy, go to Anthony."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane said, "Unless Mr. Johnson agrees to forgive you, the Turner family and the Dragon Guild will always regard you as enemies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin and Rose could only turn to Anthony. Alvin gritted his teeth and suddenly shouted, "Anthony, it has nothing to do with me. It was Anne who seduced me in order to gain the support of the Blake family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know, I... I like men and have no interest in women. She forced me to sleep with her. In order to achieve her goal, she even drugged me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone present was shocked at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a young master of a wealthy family, Alvin was well-known in Yoland. Previously, at his engagement party with Anne, Anthony had released a video of him with a man. But he had refused to admit it and said that Anthony had synthesized the video with computer technology.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone had been skeptical and did not pursue the matter, giving him some respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no one had thought that Alvin actually admitted in person that he liked men in order to seek Anthony's forgiveness and put the blame on Anne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people around them all burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne was embarrassed and anxious. She shouted, "Bullshit. Alvin, it was you who seduced me first. You came to me just to get the resources of the Smith family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, I shouldn't have betrayed you. I was wrong. I still love you deeply. Now, I beg you to remarry me. As long as you promise me, I can do anything for you in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were full of anticipation, and she really felt regretful now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony sneered, "At the beginning, I treated you wholeheartedly and took care of you like a servant. But you ignored my goodness. You only cared about fame, wealth, and status. You played me like a fool and married me just to take advantage of me. Now, you want to remarry me. You idiot, do you think you deserve it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne hurriedly said, "Yes, I am not worthy. So, you can continue to be with Ms. Turner, and I will be your lover. When Ms. Turner is not convenient, you can come to me at any time. I promise to be there whenever you call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, I will definitely satisfy you." With that, she even pulled her clothes down at her chest to show more of her breasts to Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were in the past, Anthony would definitely be moved by her sexy movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he felt that there was no difference between seeing two stones and her breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Women's bodies were attractive because of their interesting souls, but their bodies were no different from a pile of rotten meat once their souls became foul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony didn't feel anything but thought that Anne was a little pitiful. He thought, "I should be grateful to Anne for her cruelty and shamelessness in kicking me out. Otherwise, how could I be where I am today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want to talk nonsense with such people. He looked at Rose and said with a smile, "Rose, people like this will pollute the air and affect everyone's mood if they stay here. Kick them out. Next, I would like to ask you to dance with me in a relaxed and happy mood."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose hurriedly said, "Of course. Dariel, throw them out. They are not allowed to set </span><span>foot on the Turner family's territory ever again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it." Dariel waved his hand. Then, four guards rushed up, holding Alvin and Anne's arms, and walked outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin and Anne were held up with their feet off the ground, but they were still unwilling to give up and shouted for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, please forgive us. We were wrong. We shouldn't have shamed you. Now we know that you are a hidden dragon, and it is we who are blind," said Alvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the more embarrassed they shouted, the more of a joke they became in the eyes of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, everyone had learned their lesson. No matter what would happen to Anthony in the future, at least he was currently a guest of honor of Rose and Jane. For the sake of the two women, they all had to curry favor with Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone said, "The two bugs have finally been expelled. Mr. Johnson, aren't you going to ask Ms. Turner to dance? We are all waiting to admire your dancing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another shouted excitedly, "Yes. Mr. Johnson and Ms. Turner, please dance together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose was a little shy, but today was her twentieth birthday party. From now on, she would manage family affairs as the heir, which marked her true adulthood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing Anthony's affectionate gaze, she felt that she was an adult now and could take control of her life and grasp the happiness she wanted. So, she stood up bravely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A piece of dance music slowly sounded. Anthony held Rose's hand and looked at her affectionately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at them with envy because Anthony and Rose were the perfect match now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as they were about to dance, a shrill scream suddenly sounded from the direction of the gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately afterward, wolves howled from all directions.</span></p></div>
