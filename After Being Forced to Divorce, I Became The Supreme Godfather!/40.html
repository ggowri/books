        <h1>Chapter 39 Transformation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was deep in thought, analyzing the Evil Spirit Legion and the mutant werewolves, when Seraph suddenly asked if he liked Rose. He was taken aback for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he like Rose?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose's stunningly beautiful face and her caring, expressive eyes flashed through his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strange, comforting feeling from their embrace brought a sigh of relief. He relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he first encountered Rose and spent a mere three days with her in Dragon Guild, it felt as though he was reuniting with old friends from a past life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Protecting her in danger had felt natural, almost instinctive, and he had almost forgotten it was part of the Chosen Path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, from the very depths of his heart, he felt an overwhelming desire to protect her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Seraph's piercing gaze, Anthony hesitated, not wanting to reveal his true feelings. He took a sip of liquor and said, "I'm just doing this for the mission."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph didn't press further but smiled knowingly, "I understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Regardless of why the Evil Spirit Legion wanted to kill Rose or who's behind it, her family will surely conduct a thorough investigation. Now that she was in danger while with you, you might be implicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With the Turner family's influence in Yoland, you still can't compete. So, the most pressing matter is for you to start making some preparations ahead of time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony realized he was scheduled to meet with the Turner family the day after tomorrow. If they harbored any suspicions about him, it would be like stepping into a lion's den. He quickly inquired, "What kind of preparations are you talking about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First, make yourself stronger!" Seraph said, her eyes scanning his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recalling how she had previously taunted him for being weak, saying he couldn't even strip her of her clothes, Anthony felt a twinge of irritation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two "ding" sounds came from outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph smiled, "Alright, Mr. Johnson, follow me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grasped his hand as they stepped out of the dimly lit bar to the sterile laboratory. There, two tubes of blood and bone marrow had been reduced to small cups, resembling oral liquids.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She handed the two oral liquids to Anthony. "The drug that stimulates the metahumans changes the composition of their blood and bone marrow. It originally </span><span>had severe side effects, but after my purification, there were none.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Though this mutant werewolf is only a primary level and not very powerful, his purified blood and bone marrow are equivalent to a hundred-year-old elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Johnson, I want you to take this essence of blood and bone marrow. These will transform your body. Now, they won't make you strong enough to best me, not just yet, but they should elevate you to the prowess of a novice warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And the effects are permanent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was elated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of his current abilities were still triggered by Devil Eye. During battles, it often felt like Devil Eye was controlling him. In fact, he was indeed lacking in the strength department.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "This purified werewolf blood and essence had the power to completely reinvent me. It was downright transformative!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see! Thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was so excited he almost hugged Seraph, but the memory of the spiked bionic suit made him step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph smiled charmingly, "Hugs are allowed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stepped forward and embraced him, her ample chest pressing against his, making his heart race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Johnson, go become stronger. Once you do, I'll guide you through the next step."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She leaned in, her whisper tickling his ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her breath sent shivers down his spine, and Anthony had to swallow hard to control himself. He felt an overwhelming surge to pull her into a tight embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good luck!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a final encouraging look, Seraph turned and left without looking back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Driven by the desire to become stronger, Anthony put aside his distracted thoughts, took the purified blood and essence, and quickly returned to his room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just to be safe, he scanned them with Devil Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ding! Werewolf essence alert: Consume this, and you'll be reborn as someone entirely new.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ding! Werewolf blood essence: Take it, and you'll be bursting with energy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebirth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Energy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph had indeed been truthful with Anthony. Sitting cross-legged on the floor, Anthony poured the contents of the small vial of essence into his mouth, ready for the transformation to begin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The substance, which should have been foul-smelling, now emitted a fragrance of spiritual medicine, sliding down his throat like gelatinous jelly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mentally practiced the Energy-absorbing Breathing, activating his body's functions to absorb the essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, a thick, tar-like substance began to ooze from his pores, covering his skin. This was the werewolf essence at work, purifying his body and expelling all impurities from his system in a visceral, transformative purge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the next morning, Anthony opened his eyes, feeling his body like the morning sun, </span><span>vibrant and full of energy, as if he had boundless strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief shuffle to rinse off the foul-smelling residue under a shower, he returned, settling down once more. With a determined look, he uncorked the small bottle of werewolf blood and drank it down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The potent medicinal properties within the essence and blood started their alchemy, beginning the profound transformation of his very blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his blood circulated, a visible metamorphosis unfolded at a pace that was astonishingly perceptible; his skin tightened and smoothed, and his hair regrew with a lustrous sheen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time evening cast its shadows, Anthony felt as though he had shed his old self entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His skin had taken on a resilient, almost luminous quality, his hair turned lustrous, and his eyes shone with a bright, indefatigable energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but let out a triumphant howl to the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Seraph walked in, her appearance strikingly different. She had changed from her usual revealing outfit into a flowing golden gown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hair flowed down her back like a silken waterfall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing at the doorway, she watched Anthony with a blend of satisfaction and pride. Against the canvas of the moonlit night, she appeared almost ethereal, like a deity stepping down from the celestial heaven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, realizing he was still naked with his body in a state of heightened arousal, quickly pulled the quilt over himself, feeling a bit awkward. "The first step is complete. Now, can you tell me what the second step is?"</span></p></div>
