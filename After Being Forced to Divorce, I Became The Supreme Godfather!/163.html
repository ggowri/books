        <h1>Chapter 162 You Certainly Have Guts</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur was stunned, while Anne couldn't hide her excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly asked, "Sir, are you saying that the Turner family has fallen too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the past few days, Anthony had been hiding in the Turner family, and Anne was well aware of this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, when the messenger said Anthony was dead, her first thought was that the Turner family must have been destroyed for that to happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, her question seemed to upset the messenger, who replied coldly, "You don't need to know the details."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You only need to understand that following </span><span>Archlord</span><span> </span><span>Iscairn</span><span> will be the smartest decision of your life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Evil Spirit Legion will ensure your family thrives for generations, rising to greatness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I apologize."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I spoke out of turn..." Anne immediately bowed, her body stiff with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, rest assured. I swear to serve the Evil Spirit Legion and </span><span>Archlord</span><span> </span><span>Iscairn</span><span> with my life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I betray, I'll accept any punishment..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We swear to serve you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, Anne, Alvin, and the others hurried to pledge their loyalty. They were all eager to prove their allegiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur hesitated, still worried about Anthony. But after a moment of thought, he reluctantly joined in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him fall in line, Anne smiled with relief and said, "Mr. Hastings, have you finally made up your mind to join </span><span>Archlord</span><span> </span><span>Iscairn</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur froze, unsure of how to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't intended to pledge allegiance, but now that the words were out, it seemed too late to backtrack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he refused in front of the messenger, he wouldn't make it out of Wolf Fang Valley alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't sure about the messenger's abilities, but the way things were going, the man didn't seem weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If a fight broke out, he wasn't confident in his chances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, Anthony had given strict instructions to gather information quietly, without causing any trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes." After a brief moment, Arthur made up his mind, bowing respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am willing to serve </span><span>Archlord</span><span> </span><span>Iscairn</span><span> with my life, without hesitation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, the messenger didn't seem particularly impressed. He glanced over at Arthur briefly and then turned away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Anne grew anxious and quickly said, "Sir, Mr. Hastings is an exceptional B-level Metahuman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When Anthony caused chaos at the Smith family banquet, Mr. Hastings single-handedly defeated him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was only after my persuasion that he agreed to join us and follow the Evil Spirit Legion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne was eager to claim credit, hoping to make the most of her earlier efforts to win Arthur over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A B-level Metahuman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The messenger finally turned his attention back to Arthur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir." Arthur nodded, silently cursing Anne for </span><span>being so talkative</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well done." The messenger studied Arthur for a long moment, then glanced at Anne </span><span>with a satisfied look. "When we meet </span><span>Archlord</span><span> </span><span>Iscairn</span><span>, I will put in a good word for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne beamed, bowing deeply. "Thank you. It's the least I could do..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the crowd, Alvin clenched his teeth in frustration. If things kept going this way, Anne might actually end up running Yoland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the thought, he was itching to speak out but dared not make a move. He didn't want to step out of line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could give it any more thought, the messenger waved his hand, signaling everyone to disperse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, you may leave now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Arthur stepped forward, gathering his courage to ask, "Sir, if I may... what's with all the mining equipment?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne froze, and everyone else was caught off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected Arthur to be so bold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, if the messenger hadn't mentioned it, it was likely because he didn't want to discuss it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected, the messenger's expression darkened, and he sneered. "You certainly have guts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne gasped, hurrying to explain. "Sir, he... he didn't mean any disrespect..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could finish, the messenger's tone softened. "I like brave people."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne stood frozen, confused, glancing back and forth between the messenger and Arthur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that, Arthur let out a quiet sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason he had dared to ask was that he suspected the Evil Spirit Legion's interest in Anne and the others must be part of a bigger scheme.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they were buying up mining equipment in large quantities, which didn't make sense at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had come to Wolf Fang Valley with Anne to help Anthony gather intelligence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If all he brought back were a few scraps of information, he would look useless. But if he could figure out why the Evil Spirit Legion was buying the equipment, it would be a whole different story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was certain that Anthony's suspicions about the Evil Spirit Legion's plot had something to do with these mining tools</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>And</span><span> </span><span>those </span><span>detail</span><span>s</span><span> w</span><span>ere</span><span> key.</span></p></div>
