        <h1>Chapter 119 The Charm of Maturity</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle for the Turner family stretched from noon until nightfall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As dusk descended, Anthony finished his bath and, with Rose by his side, made his way to the main hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After their union, Anthony's power had grown exponentially. His Devil Eye had also broken through its limits, granting him numerous new abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the changes in him were not immediately apparent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, Rose had made significant strides. Her healing superpower had reached Level B, and she had awakened a new elemental power: Water power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, she had used mist to channel her healing power, but now, she could fully manipulate water itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her appearance had also undergone noticeable changes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her skin now resembled delicate white jade, smooth and flawless, glowing with a soft radiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After their union, her noble aura was now infused with a sense of maturity and grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the main hall, Carolyn, already washed and waiting, greeted them with a smile when she saw them enter together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She walked forward to meet them, her expression warm with approval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was still somewhat of a stranger to Carolyn. They had only known each other for a day, and that day had been filled with life-or-death struggles for the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their darkest hour, it was Anthony, a complete stranger, who had stepped forward to save them, disregarding his own safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This debt of gratitude was not something Carolyn could forget.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Rose had spoken of Anthony as her true soulmate, and their bond had deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose's breakthrough in power was all the proof she needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Johnson, please sit down," Carolyn said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Carolyn Turner, there's no need for such formality. Just call me Anthony," he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn chuckled softly as she sat down, teasing. "Mr. Johnson, it's quite amusing that you still call me Ms. Carolyn Turner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at Rose, who turned red and instinctively looked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In old families like the Turners, matters of romance and relationships were typically approached with strict standards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in this case, Rose had made her own decision to sleep with Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given the circumstances, Rose had had no choice, even though she knew Carolyn would not hold it against her. Yet, Carolyn's glance still made her feel shy. She hesitated for a moment before speaking. "Aunt Carolyn, I&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah," Carolyn waved her hand dismissively. "Silly girl, did you think I would fault you for this? In such a situation, you were free to make whatever choice you felt best, and it seems your decision was right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a reassuring smile, Carolyn added, "You don't need to explain anything. From now on, I'll consider Anthony a member of the Turner family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose's expression softened with relief. "Thank you, Aunt Carolyn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony also relaxed, knowing this topic had been a source of anxiety for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family was old and prestigious, while he was still a relatively unknown figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt he wasn't quite worthy of Rose yet, but he knew that time would prove his worth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was genuinely worried that Carolyn might make things difficult for Rose because of this matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of small talk, Carolyn asked, "Anthony, did you defeat Mr. Foster?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, when Anthony had allowed the werewolf army to escape, Carolyn had wanted to intervene but refrained, respecting Anthony's decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Mason was a formidable Level B werewolf metahuman, and if left alive, he would certainly return to cause trouble for the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony had prepared for this question. He shook his head, saying, "Carolyn, I let Mason go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn frowned but didn't respond immediately. She waited for him to continue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is... a complicated matter to explain right now," Anthony said, pausing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I can assure you that Mason will not trouble the Turner family again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chose not to explain the details of the Devil Eye or the situation with Arthur. There was simply no good way to explain it for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief pause, Anthony shifted the topic. "But Mason told me that their attack on the Turner family was not because of Vincent or because of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was premeditated," he continued. "I believe there's more to this than we know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Carolyn, think about it&mdash;why would the Evil Spirit Legion go to such lengths to attack the Turner family? What could their motive possibly be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn hesitated, then spoke. "To be honest, I've considered this as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At first, I thought it was because of Vincent, but upon reflection, the scale of the attack didn't seem like something that could have been a spur-of-the-moment decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I suspected it was planned, but what could it be about? I really can't figure that out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn didn't press further about Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For her, the safety of the Turner family was all that mattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She trusted Anthony and didn't believe he would harm them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rumors that he had joined the Evil Spirit Legion?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pure nonsense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony spent the afternoon thinking deeply. "We must get to the bottom of this," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, the Evil Spirit Legion will definitely return, and we'll be caught unprepared."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure." Carolyn's expression grew serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they truly were to return, the Evil Spirit Legion would be even more ruthless than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Rose spoke up. "Do you think... could it be about the drugs?"</span></p></div>
