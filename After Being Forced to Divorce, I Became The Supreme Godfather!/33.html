        <h1>Chapter 32 Prelude to the Onslaught</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's heart skipped a beat in sheer astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The assassins disregarded Rose's safety entirely, launching their assault with reckless abandon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this sniper, lurking in the shadows, struck with chilling precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This had to be the signature mark of a professional assassin, wielding a high-explosive sniper rifle with deadly precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reacting on instinct, Anthony slammed the brakes, bringing the SUV to a screeching halt in the tunnel's belly. Beyond the reach of the headlights, darkness loomed like a beast ready to devour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those bastards actually dare to fire with Ms. Turner in here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm gonna give them a lesson they won't forget!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen fumed, her voice seething with rage as she reached for the door handle, intent on confronting the hidden assailant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's warning was sharp, his hands swiftly maneuvering the vehicle sideways. A cacophony of gunfire erupted, bullets hammering against the thickened steel of the car's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, he swerved the car sideways just in the nick of time, and the reinforced </span><span>steel plating of the vehicle's side absorbed the impact of the bullets. Had the car been facing forward, the windshield would have offered no protection against such firepower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, all three of them had sustained injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the initial volley failed to achieve its goal, the shooter lurking in the shadows ahead ceased fire momentarily, seemingly biding his time for the perfect moment to strike again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony barely had a moment to breathe when he noticed the pursuers, previously swallowed by the dark, now speeding toward him from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A machine gun was perched ominously on their roof.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're trying to box us in!" Anthony exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose looked pale and pleaded, "Anthony, don't worry. Let me out; I'll talk to them. They wouldn't dare harm me once they see who I am."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she reached for the door handle, intent on stepping out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Freeze!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony grabbed her and turned grave. "Haven't you noticed? They don't care if you live or die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression fell. "They also want me dead? What do we do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is outrageous!" Helen interjected. "Ms. Turner, call home! Get Dariel Stein to bring the cavalry and wipe these thugs out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel, the imposing captain of Turner Guards, was no ordinary man; he was a beast metahuman, which cemented his status as a living legend in Yoland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose, spurred by the suggestion, fumbled for her phone to make a call, but her frustration was palpable as she exclaimed, "No signal! What on earth is happening?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This was planned," Anthony stated with grim certainty. "They've jammed the signals. We're on our own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quick, get to the back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He threw decorum to the wind, giving Rose a firm push on her backside towards the back of the vehicle, and swiftly moved in behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do we do now?" Helen, perched anxiously in the back seat, asked with a voice laced with panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you drive?" Anthony asked calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony instructed hastily, "There's no time to waste. We need to escape this tunnel or we're sitting ducks. Helen, take the wheel. Follow my lead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her fear, Helen knew she had to take the risk if they were to escape quickly. She scrambled into the driver's seat, ducked low, and asked, "Okay, what do I do next?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spotting the vehicle gaining on them from behind, Anthony commanded, "Open the sunroof, now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Helen hit the switch, and the sunroof began to slide open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pursuing vehicle drew near, poised to attack. Anthony abruptly emerged through the opening, and with the aid of Devil Eye, he unleashed a torrent of bullets from his M9 submachine gun, firing almost instinctively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guided by Devil Eye's calculations, the trajectory of each bullet was pinpoint precise, instantly taking out the machine gunner who had dared to pop his head out from the roof of the trailing car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony squeezed off several more rounds, each one finding its mark as he shot the driver squarely in the head. The vehicle veered wildly, crashing through the tunnel's side before flipping over in a chaotic tumble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Drive, Helen!" Anthony's voice boomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen didn't waste a second; she ignited the engine, and the SUV bellowed like a frenzied beast, surging forward into the enveloping darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sniper, cloaked in darkness, took aim at Anthony, who was half-exposed on the car's roof, and commenced his sharp, calculated sniping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, as if gifted with foresight, evaded each bullet with minimal movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gunfire betrayed the sniper's position ahead. Anthony, quick on the draw, raised his hand and unleashed a barrage of bullets in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The darkness was pierced by the cries of the fallen ambushers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those assassins lurking in the shadows met their end, dispatched into the afterlife without ever understanding why or how.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before any could retaliate, the SUV burst out of the tunnel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At last, they emerged from the oppressive darkness of the tunnel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, the city streets greeted them with the glow of streetlights, and in the distance, a sea of thousands of lights twinkled. The harrowing ordeal they had just endured seemed now like nothing more than a fleeting nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anthony couldn't afford to let his guard down, for he spotted a fleet of black, unlicensed vehicles converging on their position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, as if the city itself was an accomplice to the impending violence, the streetlights began to extinguish, one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Buildings and malls darkened, plunging the city into an ominous blackout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if the city was setting the stage for a merciless slaughter.</span></p></div>
