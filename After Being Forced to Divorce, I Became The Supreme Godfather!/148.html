        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was not to be hired or fight lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He did not accept temporary employment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin was stunned, while Anne asked, "Mr. Hastings, unless what?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just tell me what conditions you have. As long as you can capture Anthony, everything will be easy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was so strong that Anne was terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With such strong combat power, she didn't think the Smith family could withstand him, so she placed all her hopes on Arthur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the very least, Arthur looked confident. And even after seeing Anthony's fighting ability, he still looked calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought Anthony would definitely not be his opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Anne said, as long as Anthony could be captured, she would agree to any conditions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No problem."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur smiled calmly, took a sip of red wine, put two hands together, and made the number ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne was stunned for a moment and said blankly, "What does this mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five hundred million dollars a year."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur said, "And we need to sign a contract for at least ten years. In other words, for five billion dollars, I can guarantee the safety of your family for ten years!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, Alvin exclaimed, "Aaron, you are a fucking bandit, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bandits were not as cruel as Arthur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur was not angry. He leisurely shook the red wine glass and looked at Anne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that Alvin had no say in the matter, so Arthur simply didn't bother to pay attention to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne was also shocked and said, "The price is indeed a bit outrageous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five hundred million dollars. Do you know how many Warriors I can hire to look after my house?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur nodded and said, "I know. Then, please invite them quickly, or it will be too late."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation was urgent. Anthony was right in front of us, full of murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne didn't have time to invite the other Warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin was furious and shouted angrily, "Aaron, you are adding insult to injury!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Arthur shook his head and said, "First of all, you should know that I am a businessman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When doing business, we need to examine the situation carefully. The price is determined based on your current situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, I didn't say you had to hire me, did I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin was speechless. Looking at Arthur's arrogant look, he wanted to beat him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne was hesitant. She looked at Arthur with anger but also a bit of unconcealed appreciation and agitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a man!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only with strong power could one have a strong voice. A real man should be so tough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What about Alvin?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was so weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne couldn't help but want to agree to Arthur's conditions, but the money...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just for Anthony? Was a loser worth half a billion dollars?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if he had guessed Anne's thoughts, Arthur said, "Ms. Smith, I want to remind you that the money was spent not for Anthony but for the Smith family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Given the hatred between you and Anthony, if you don't stop him in time, maybe he </span><span>will really go on a killing spree..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just taking advantage of the situation. Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Arthur could finish, Alvin cursed angrily, and then said, "Anne, don't listen to him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony is just a piece of trash, not worth the money. Besides, there are so many people in the Smith family and the Blake family. We can capture Anthony!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't forget all his strength is just due to the drugs. After fighting for so long, the effect of the drugs should have been almost consumed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Without the support of drugs, how many people can he beat? Thirty? Fifty? Or a hundred?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is the Blake family's security?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for Anne to answer, Alvin shouted loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We are here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of people in the crowd stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, there was a large group of people not far away, gathering rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were members of the Blake family, or in other words, Alvin's personal guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were about forty or fifty people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there were many people in the Smith family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Anthony's fierce battle, the Smith family had gathered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were at least seventy or eighty people. Together with the Blake family, there were at least hundreds of people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, this was not the entire strength of the Smith family. All of them add up to over a hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's eyes lit up, and she nodded, "Yes! I have forgotten this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's just a piece of trash. So what if he's a good fighter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne waved her hand and ordered, "Listen, do everything you can to surround and kill Anthony!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoever can kill him will be rewarded one hundred million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Ms. Smith!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The high reward had many guards coveted.</span></p></div>
