        <h1>Chapter 171 Succession Ceremony</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne </span><span>sneered,</span><span> her expression full of disdain. "</span><span>You</span><span> watchdog, don't get cocky in front of me. L</span><span>isten up</span><span>&mdash;this time, the Turner family is done for. Not even </span><span>Jesus</span><span> can save you. If you don't want to die, you'd better submit to me while you still can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You?" Dariel let out an incredulous laugh, anger bubbling beneath it. He looked Anne up and down before saying, "Have you completely lost your mind? You want me to submit to you? You've got to be kidding me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could say another word, Dariel barked out, "Enough nonsense. I'll give you three minutes to get out. Otherwise, don't blame me for what happens next." The moment his words fell, a large group of Turner guards appeared from all directions, </span><span>closing in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Alvin strode over with a loud laugh. "Looks like this guard dog doesn't understand the situation, huh? The Turner family is already on its way out. What's there to be so arrogant about? Hmm?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, Dariel's face turned bright red with anger. He cursed. "What did you just say, you son of a bitch? Who the hell do you think you are, barking at my doorstep like this? Believe me, I'll cut you down where you stand!" As he spoke, he drew a long blade with a sharp swish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin had balls, causing shit at Turner Manor. Dariel wasn't about to play nice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alvin didn't flinch, stepping up with fire in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Alvin was about to charge ahead, Anne grabbed his arm and pulled him back, clearly annoyed. "</span><span>Hey</span><span>! Are you insane? Can't you see the envoy's people haven't arrived yet? If you provoke him now, and he really decides to kill you, what then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Alvin snapped out of it. "Uh..." He thought to himself, "That's right. The Evil Spirit Legion's people haven't shown up yet. This isn't the time to act tough. But I've already talked big and made a scene. How can I back down now, in front of all these people?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he was still debating with himself, a rugged off-road vehicle pulled up with a screech. Then, Sergio stepped out with a few men, his posture straight, exuding an intimidating presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Sergio's imposing manner, Alvin quickly retreated a few steps, making way without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel sheathed his blade, addressing Sergio directly. "Perfect timing. What's the situation at the Mines? Why are you back here alone? Where's Ms. Carolyn Turner and Ms. Turner?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sergio smirked but didn't bother to respond. He simply strode into the Turner Manor without a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel frowned in confusion and called after him, "Sergio? I'm talking to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sergio finally stopped in his tracks, reached into his pocket, and pulled out a pendant. His tone was grim as he asked, "Do you recognize this, Dariel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel squinted at the item before his expression stiffened. He frowned as he asked, "Isn't that Ms. Carolyn Turner's pendant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right." Sergio nodded proudly. Afterward, he raised his voice to say, "By Ms. Carolyn Turner's order&mdash;Dariel, listen closely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel's heart skipped a beat, but he still clasped his hands and answered respectfully, "I'm </span><span>all ears</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sergio ignored him again. Instead, he turned toward the main courtyard of the Turner Manor and shouted, "Where's Abel? Get out here and listen to the command."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel tilted his head slightly, staring at Sergio with a mix of confusion and unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Something's off. Something has to be off. How did he come back with Ms. Carolyn Turner's pendant? And why is he acting all high and mighty, like he owns the </span><span>place</span><span>?" Dariel pondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, a middle-aged man briskly walked out and nodded toward Sergio, waiting for instructions. "At your service," he said. It was Abel Gehry. He looked to </span><span>be in his fifties, with streaks of gray in his hair. Tall and lean, he wore gold-rimmed glasses and had the refined air of a scholar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After nodding, Abel instinctively glanced at Dariel. Their eyes met, and in that brief moment, both saw the same confusion mirrored in each other's gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sergio paid them no attention and instead announced loudly, "By orde</span><span>r of</span><span> Ms. Carolyn Turner, the succession ceremony will take place at noon today in the Turner family's Mines. Captain Stein, take Abel Gehry with the Turner family elders and heads to the Mines without delay. Do not fail."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Dariel and Abel were stunned to hear about the succession ceremony&mdash;at the Turner family's Mines, no less. The two exchanged another look, their eyes fill</span><span>ing</span><span> with</span><span> </span><span>shock and doubt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel thought</span><span>, "</span><span>I</span><span>'ve never heard </span><span>anything about this</span><span> succession ceremony. </span><span>And</span><span>, even if there was one, wouldn't it be at the Turner Manor? Why the Mines of all places?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing their hesitation, Sergio sneered tauntingly, "What's the matter? Are you planning to defy the orders?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What..." Dariel </span><span>paus</span><span>ed for a moment before shaking his head. "No, we wouldn't dare. We'll follow the order."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abel quickly followed suit. "Yes, we will."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pendant Carolyn had left behind was the symbol of authority for the head of the Turner family. With Sergio holding it, no one dared to disobey. In a powerful household like theirs, being labeled as someone who defies orders was a risk no one wanted to take.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After agreeing to carry out the orders, Dariel looked up and asked, "Sergio, why would Ms. Carolyn Turner suddenly decide to hold a succession ceremony? And why at the Mines instead of the Turner Manor? What's going on </span><span>t</span><span>here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Dariel voiced his doubts, Abel turned as well, his gaze complicated as he stared at Sergio.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sergio smirked smugly and explained, "Because Mr. Vincent Turner discovered a </span><span>Leyline</span><span> at the Mines&mdash;something capable of changing the Turner family's destiny. That's why Mr. Vincent Turner is unquestionably the successor to the family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The ceremony is being held at the Mines because that's where the turning point in the Turner family's fate lies. Got it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment those words left his mouth, Dariel froze, completely stunned. Abel's eyes widened, and he let out an incredulous gasp. "What? Mr. Vincent Turner? Y-you mean to say that the successor is Mr. Vincent Turner?"</span></p></div>
