        <h1>Chapter 96 No Way to Escape</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony..." Rose frantically tried to activate her healing power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was also taken aback with shock and, without a moment's hesitation, gave the order, "Someone, escort Mr. Johnson and Ms. Turner to the safe house, quickly! The rest of you, follow me to fight the enemy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Ma'am!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Anthony unconscious, Jane didn't dare to be careless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before he lost consciousness, he seemed to say that he had found a way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Specifically, what method it was, Jane didn't know, but she chose to trust Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Jane knew that Rose was a Metahuman with healing superpower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's injuries were no trifling matter; even if they left now to get him help, it might be too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, Anthony couldn't leave now. He must stay and let Rose save his life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Werewolves, attack! Destroy the Turner family, capture Rose alive..." The inevitable downfall of the Turner family led Mason to raise his arm and shout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of werewolves came rushing in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they charged forward, dust and sand flew up into the sky, and the heavy thudding of their footsteps shook the earth. The vast Turner Manor seemed to tremble at the onslaught!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd not far away was terrified, trembling with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony has ultimately been defeated; Mason is too strong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, that level of combat power is truly terrifying."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Speaking of which, Anthony is quite strong too, to have held on for so long..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd huddled together, trembling, and began to whisper among themselves, their words tinged with pity for Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What nonsense are you all talking about?" Anne's face darkened as she spoke disapprovingly, "He's just a loser who relied on drugs to boost his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as Mr. Foster!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You people actually still have hope for a loser! What a bunch of jokers!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I warn you again: sincerely submit to Mr. Foster and join the Evil Spirit Legion, and </span><span>you will not lack benefits in the future!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if anyone dares to support Mr. Foster's enemies, even if Mr. Foster does not pursue it, I will certainly not let them off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing proudly, Anne's words exude the overbearing demeanor of a superior, as if she had already become the ruler of Yoland!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In response to this, no one else dared to contradict her; they all shrank back, keeping their heads down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because they knew that even if the Turner family were gone, control of Yoland would not fall to them. The future ruler of this city would surely be either Anne or Alvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin snorted coldly and said, "Ladies and gentlemen, you had better face reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, Anthony is dead for sure! Even with divine help, he can't possibly win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The downfall of the Turner family is inevitable. If you are wise, it would be better to start making preparations early..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin was speaking fluently when he suddenly froze, his voice cutting off abruptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, he subconsciously looked at Anne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two exchanged a glance, as if suddenly enlightened, and in unison, they both suggested leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, without further ado, the two avoided the attacking werewolf army and quickly left the Turner Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'd better leave as well..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry, let's go, come on..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two left abruptly, and naturally, the others didn't feel like staying here, following closely behind as if fleeing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others needed to prepare, and naturally, Anne and Alvin did too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The death of Anthony and the downfall of the Turner family meant that there would be a tremendous change in the situation in Yoland!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some matters must be arranged in advance. Only by performing well could they further earn Mason's trust!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the heat of the battle, neither the werewolf army nor the other members of the Turner family noticed these people, allowing them to leave freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, not far away, Jane couldn't help but feel daunted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolf army was vast and unstoppable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She definitely couldn't stop these beats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In desperation, Jane led Turner Guards and her people in a fighting retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her main goal was to escort Anthony and Rose to safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But retreating was no easy task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolf army surged like a mountain flood, sweeping away everything in its path!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading from the front, Jane, clad in red, wielded a jet-black whip, ruthlessly lashing the werewolves until their skin split and bled. They howled in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, that was the extent of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could break their skin and flesh, but found it hard to kill them unless she struck </span><span>the same werewolf repeatedly with her unrelenting whip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after being hit once, the werewolves would howl and retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If there were only a few werewolves, it might be manageable, but the key issue was that there were far too many of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As one retreated, three more would inevitably push forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer number of them was enough to make her scalp tingle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was also extremely troubled by the werewolves' tactics. In previous battles, the werewolves had used exactly this kind of strategy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One wave would retreat while another would launch a fierce attack, back and forth, as if they were engaged in a relay battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Jane had long noticed that the werewolves that retreated and then returned seemed to have their strength somewhat replenished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was due to some drugs, or perhaps it was something else; in any case, there was definitely something strange about it.</span></p></div>
