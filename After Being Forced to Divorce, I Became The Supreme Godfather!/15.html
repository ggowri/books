        <h1>Chapter 15 Provocation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Releasing a bounty at the Dragon Guild is no joke. Once it's official, the underworld will stop at nothing to hunt Anthony down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I guess Anthony's plan is to intercept them before they enter the guild, beg them to change their minds. If the bounty gets released, it's like signing his death sentence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony sure made a scene at the engagement party yesterday, but that was more of a reckless outburst than anything else. Now that he's had a moment to cool off, he's probably realizing just how deep of a hole he dug himself into."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That was just a flash of bravado. Watch, Anthony's about to beg his ex-wife for forgiveness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd watched with growing interest, murmuring amongst themselves as the tension unfolded before their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Beg for forgiveness?" Anthony sneered at Anne. "I didn't do anything wrong. Why the hell would I apologize to you, a cheating bitch?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spat the words out with disgust, his eyes hard. "Now get out of my way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's face flushed with anger. Without thinking, she stepped in front of him, blocking his path. Her eyes were red, her voice shaky with rage. "I know what you're trying to do. You're clinging to me, hoping for a reconciliation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't you get it through your head? We are done. We're from two different worlds now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Reconciliation?" Anthony looked at her, amusement dancing in his eyes. "Isn't that what you want? If you give me a blow job right now, maybe I'll consider giving you another shot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're such a bastard!" Anne slapped him hard across the face, her fury making her movements sharp and violent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin's eyes burned with rage. "You little piece of shit, you really think I won't just end you right here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony wiped his face and sneered at Anne. "I'll remember that slap. And when you come crawling back one day, regretting everything and begging to remarry, I'll pay you back twice as hard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Alvin, mocking him with a cold smile. "You think you can kill me? Go ahead. I won't even lift a finger. But let's see who dares to kill someone in front of the gates of the Dragon Guild."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin gritted his teeth. "You can't hide here forever. The moment you step out of the Dragon Guild, I'll have you torn to pieces."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony opened his mouth to retort, but just then, a cheer rang out from the crowd. The trading time had begun, and the doors of the Dragon Guild opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't have time for this!" Anthony tossed them a final glance before sprinting toward the entrance, excitement bubbling up inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin stared in disbelief. "Does this idiot think anyone can just waltz into the Dragon Guild?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne ground her teeth in frustration. "He must think he can trick his way in as my ex-husband. We can't let him get away with this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them ran after him, yelling, "Stop him! He's not a member. He's trying to sneak in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The commotion at the gate caught the attention of the Dragon Guards. Four of them immediately stepped forward, their expressions cold and imposing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One guard, radiating authority, barked, "Trespassing at the Dragon Guild is punishable by death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd of elite businessmen, who had been calmly waiting their turn, was now stunned. Most of them had assumed Anthony was here to plead with Alvin and Anne to stop issuing a bounty on his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to their astonishment, it seemed Anthony was actually trying to sneak into the guild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes were on him in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin stormed forward, pointing an accusing finger. "I'll vouch for it. This guy's no member! He's just trying to worm his way in and disgrace the Dragon Guild!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should take him down! Execute him right here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the guards locked eyes with Anthony and spoke in an icy tone. "The Dragon Guild is members-only. Answer me. Are you a member?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's expression remained calm as he shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guard pressed on, "Members are allowed to bring one guest. Do you have anyone bringing you in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Anthony could reply, Anne stepped forward, her voice sharp. "He's not with anyone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't tell me you're trying to sneak in here using some nonsense about being my ex-husband. Let me make it clear. My family's membership hasn't even been approved yet. If I wanted to get in, I'd need Alvin to vouch for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just give it up already!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin, brimming with self-satisfaction, pulled out a sleek silver membership card and waved it smugly. "Take a good look, Anthony. The Blake family is a proud silver-tier member of the Dragon Guild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No membership, no entry. That's the rule. If you're looking to throw your life away, great! Saves me the effort of putting a bounty on you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony smirked, his voice calm but cutting. "Who said I need a membership card to get in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin burst out laughing, almost doubling over. "You? Without a membership? Do you even know what kind of place this is? Or have you convinced yourself you're some kind of big shot?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What, are you still hung up on that little stunt you pulled yesterday? Hiring actors to pretend you're the Godfather's grandson? Don't tell me you actually believe it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers roared with laughter, the air thick with ridicule.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To them, Anthony was nothing more than a delusional fool. Someone who could never dream of standing on equal footing with the Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne crossed her arms, her gaze full of disdain. "I know the divorce hit you hard, but don't let it drive you into a fantasy. Wake up, Anthony. You're embarrassing yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's gaze sharpened, his voice cutting through the jeers. "Embarrassing? I'm not just walking into the Dragon Guild today. I'll have the director himself come out to greet me."</span></p></div>
