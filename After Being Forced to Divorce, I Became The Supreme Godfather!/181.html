        <h1>Chapter 180 The Hunt for Anthony</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his growing anxiety, Anthony knew he was out of options.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he fought and retreated, he whispered urgently, "Where are Ms. Carolyn Turner and Ms. Turner being held? What kind of security are we looking at?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, but I could only find out that there's a secret chamber north of the Mines. No details on the exact location or guard situation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur had tried to get intel on Rose and the others, but as a new recruit, Vincent's people didn't trust him enough to share much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, whatever the defenses are like, The Four Demon Lords are definitely in the Mines. Are you... are you sure you still want to rescue them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bound by their soul contract, Arthur couldn't help but worry about Anthony's safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Four Demon Lords were no joke. Their power was off the charts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From where Arthur stood, charging in blind was practically suicide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" Anthony snapped. "Get back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without warning, Anthony launched a vicious kick straight into Arthur's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact sent Arthur flying backward, slamming hard into the cliff face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of pressing his advantage, Anthony turned and bolted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!" Arthur let out a cold grunt. "You think you can just run? No way in hell! Everyone, don't let him escape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Arthur's signal, a swarm of men in black suddenly burst out from the mountain path ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were dozens of them, instantly blocking Anthony's escape route.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Anthony shouted in feigned anger, gripping </span><span>Dragonfang</span><span> as he took up a fighting stance, ready for a last stand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as planned, the men blocking the path were no match for Anthony. In the blink of an eye, he broke through their ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Useless idiots!" Arthur cursed and then launched himself after Anthony at full speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two moved so fast that they quickly disappeared from the surveillance cameras' view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Son of a bitch!" Vincent slammed his fist down in the hidden chamber. He grabbed the radio and barked, "What are you all standing around for? After them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of black-clad men took off in pursuit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mountain path was treacherous, but sticking to it would've been stupid. After running for a while, Anthony dove into the dense forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You</span><span> worthless piece of trash! You can't run away! Stop right there!" Arthur kept up the chase, hurling insults as he ran. The sounds of fighting echoed through the trees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The video feed was lost, but the sounds of their battle still came through the earpieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, we've got no beef with each other. Let me go today, and I swear I'll make it worth your while!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a fierce chase and fight, Anthony's voice came through the earpiece, begging for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've messed up Mr. Vincent Turner's plans time and time again, made enemies with the Evil Spirit Legion, and now you want mercy? Not </span><span>gonna</span><span> happen!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deep rumbling echoed through the air, followed by what sounded like Anthony coughing up blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! You piece of garbage, your time's up&mdash;" Arthur growled, and then spoke into his earpiece, "Mr. Vincent Turner, I've got Anthony. About to finish him off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a deep, thunderous roar cut through the air like a tiger in the mountains, so loud it could burst eardrums.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Arthur's scream of pain followed, along with his furious shout. "You bastard! You dirty fighter! I'll kill you! Get back here! Don't you dare run!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing something had gone wrong, Vincent barked, "What the hell's happening? What did Anthony do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the sound of spitting blood, Arthur gasped out, "Mr. Vincent Turner... that sneaky bastard Anthony... he just activated his superpower. He's... he's turned into a werewolf!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He ripped through my chest and he's running south of the Mines." Arthur choked out between coughs of blood. "I... I couldn't keep up with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Vincent's face darkened with rage. "He got away? Everyone after him, now! I don't care what it takes. He cannot escape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent was fuming. Based on how the fight had gone down, Anthony was clearly badly wounded. Killing him should've been a piece of cake. How the hell did he slip away now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!" Arthur's voice came through shaky and breathless. "Mr. Vincent Turner, I swear... even if it costs me my life, I'll take Anthony down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the tremor in Arthur's voice and his labored breathing told a different story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur was hurt&mdash;and hurt bad. There was no way he could catch up to Anthony in that condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's thought, Vincent turned to the Four Demon Lords with a respectful bow. "My Lords, Anthony is severely wounded. Please, hunt him down and finish him off personally."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very well," </span><span>Necros</span><span>, their leader, replied with a dark expression. "I've been curious to see what makes this Anthony so special anyway."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, my Lords." Vincent bowed deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent could barely contain his excitement as he turned back to Carolyn. "Just hang tight for a bit longer, Ms. Carolyn Turner. Before you know it, I'll bring you Anthony's head on a platter!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Sergio and barked. "Sergio, keep an eye on the dungeon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's move out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After ordering Sergio to guard Rose and Carolyn, Vincent swept out of the room with the Four Demon Lords, heading straight for Crimson Canyon. He'd take Anthony down, whatever it took.</span></p></div>
