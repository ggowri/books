        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So cool!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the gate, Anthony punched the Black Cloak excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this battle, he did not use his Devil Eye and fought with all his strength. He was hit by several punches from the Black Cloak, but overall, he did not suffer any loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because he didn't vomit blood!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did the Black Cloak vomit blood?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Why is Anthony so strong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene shocked Anne and the other person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the battle just now, she was chatting with Arthur and did not pay close attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But others witnessed with their own eyes that in the battle. The Black Cloak was almost always at a disadvantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Cloak slowly and steadily climbed up from the ground. His face was hideous, and his eyes were bloodshot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, there was a hint of forbearance in his fierce eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was on the verge of going berserk, yet he seemed to be afraid of something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need to hide your strength anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Use all your strength. Today, no matter what, you must kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Anthony was puzzled, Alvin, who was not far away, walked over quickly and shouted to the Black Cloak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony looked at Alvin with interest, and then at Anne and Arthur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Arthur was shocked and subconsciously sat up straight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His rebellious expression was subdued and stiffened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Anthony didn't care about this. His main focus was still on Anne and Alvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judging from Anne's expression, she seemed unaware of this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They each had their own agendas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Cloak couldn't help but feel overjoyed, and his expression became more </span><span>and more fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't have to hide his strength anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, the reason why he hid his strength was because the head of the Blake family had ordered that he should not easily reveal his strength unless it was necessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of the Black Cloak must be used to the best effect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, if he revealed his true strength in order to kill a loser like Anthony, he would definitely be punished by the Blake family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, since Alvin had agreed, there was no need for him to care so much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, after the battle, he had a new understanding of Anthony's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony had at least the strength of a Level A Warrior and was slightly stronger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Black Cloak is still hiding his strength? Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is most likely a Level B Warrior?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean by very likely? He must be a Level B Warrior. Anthony will be killed..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trash. The Black Cloak just doesn't want to kill him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right. Kill him. He's so arrogant..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Cloak stood up and wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth. The crowd cheered and shouted for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know what our biggest gap is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Cloak's aura had grown stronger. He sneered, "I didn't do my best, but you did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will show you how terrible the difference between our strengths is!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To kill you, I only need one move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A powerful force burst out from the Black Cloak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His original flagging momentum also began to change at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A visible force quickly climbed up his arms and coalesced in his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony had sharp eyes and stood still, staring tightly at the Black Cloak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that the Black Cloak was quite powerful, so he did not dare to be careless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Cloak didn't say any more words and suddenly rushed out from the dust and smoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he leaped into the air. The moment his arms spread, he swooped down from the sky like a falcon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eagle Claw Attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Cloak shouted loudly and came from the sky!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the blessing of power, his attack became extremely powerful and as if he could crush everything into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eagle claw?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's eyes flashed, and he couldn't help laughing in his heart. What a coincidence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Anthony was thinking, he heard the sound of a wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Cloak flew towards Anthony with his claws crossing in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whistling wind was sharp and fierce, causing Anthony's skin to hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Cloak looked ferocious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A trifle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony smiled coldly, without making any movement. And a powerful force burst out from his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, all the strength in his body surged and became vigorous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of a Level B Warrior exploded!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thunder Claw!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony let out a loud shout. And instead of retreating, he advanced, and then swung both hands to meet the claws of the Black Cloak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his hands danced, Anthony's fingers turned into tiger claws with a chilling light!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The violent force hit him. The Black Cloak was horrified and subconsciously wanted to retreat.</span></p></div>
