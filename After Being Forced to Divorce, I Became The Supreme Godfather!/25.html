        <h1>Chapter 25 Copy and Store</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne was stunned as the worthless man who had once followed her every command had not only made her strip naked in front of him, but he now demanded an apology from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's heart burned with fury, but strangely, when she looked at Anthony's sneering face, she felt an irresistible force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a masculine kind of dominance, one that made her involuntarily submit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without realizing it, she lowered her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this enough?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were full of helplessness and pleading, looking up at him like a lost little lamb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this position, her gaze inadvertently fell to his lower body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony clenched his teeth and began to unbuckle his belt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, no!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, don't do this! We're in Dragon Guild..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne suddenly recalled how, earlier that day, outside the Dragon Guild, Anthony had threatened her. He had said that unless she satisfied him with her mouth, he would never give her a chance at reconciliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Is Anthony really going to make me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart began to race. She begged him softly, but for some reason, her body refused to respond. She stayed motionless, still kneeling, and could feel some unfamiliar desire building inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes instinctively wandered to Anthony's lower body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had once watched him on the bedroom surveillance cameras, and now, those images flooded her thoughts. Her body tingled with longing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Anthony loosened his belt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Anne thought he was about to pull down his pants and force her into performing oral sex on him, he suddenly raised the belt and swung it down on her body with a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden pain made Anne cry out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing that others might hear, she quickly covered her mouth and muttered angrily, "You bastard, what are you doing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you crazy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You little slut, weren't you the one begging me for help?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Begging me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Beg me some more!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Beg until I'm satisfied, then I might help you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's eyes gleamed with excitement as he swung the belt again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne, completely exposed, felt the sting of the leather lash against her tender skin, leaving deep red welts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her fury boiled over. She wanted nothing more than to kill Anthony on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she knew this was Dragon Guild, and Anthony was Rose's chosen one. She couldn't fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, if she wanted to get rid of him, she would have to bide her time, waiting for the moment he fell into the trap she had so carefully set for Rose to cast him aside. Then, she'd have her revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, despite the burning pain, she forced out the words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was wrong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry! You did well! If it makes you happy, keep hitting me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, you're so handsome, so strong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a burst of excitement, she suddenly lunged forward, wrapping her arms around his thigh and reaching for his lower body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony looked down at her with a sneer. "Slut, you don't mind me touching you now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desire surged within Anne as she coquettishly purred, "I'll give you anything you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want you," Anthony said, kicking Anne away. "You're filthy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, since you seem somewhat sincere, I'll help you tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne eagerly responded, "You have to remember, the Eldergleam Fungus marked 'A' is real, and 'B' is fake! You have to make Ms. Turner pick A!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she watched Anthony turn and leave, Anne's face twisted with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, you'll pay for this tomorrow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clenched her teeth and silently raged inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ding!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Based on micro-expression psychology, this woman is lying."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving the cabin, Anthony heard the alert from his Devil Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned. He had thought Anne, after going so far as to strip and allow herself to be whipped, must be genuinely remorseful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now he knew. she had been lying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that something was wrong with tomorrow's herbs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Devil Eye, can you identify medicinal?" he asked mentally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Devil Eye responded, "The Devil Eye's deduction function operates based on a vast amount of stored knowledge. To improve its accuracy, I need more information about medicinal herbs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony suddenly understood. The Devil Eye was like a supercomputer. It needed him to keep feeding it new knowledge to enhance its abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Knowledge about medicinal herbs? I'd have to ask Rose when I get back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon returning to the villa, Anthony noticed Helen's room was still lit. He walked over and peered inside, finding Helen sitting at her computer, deeply engrossed in studying medicinal herbs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's so much to learn about medicinal... this is too difficult! But if it helps Ms. Turner, I'll keep going," Helen muttered, furrowing her brow, her face contorted in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Rose's personal maid, she wanted to learn more about the medicinal so she could assist Rose whenever necessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony couldn't help but ask, "Where did you get all this knowledge about medicinal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen replied, "This is a database compiled by generations of the Turner family, containing nearly all known information about medicinal. Even a person's lifetime wouldn't be enough to learn it all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me see," Anthony said as he moved closer, his subconscious urging, "Devil Eye, connect to the computer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He heard the Devil Eye's voice in his mind. "Connection successful. Starting to read data. Beginning copy and storage..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, Anthony felt a flood of medicinal knowledge pouring into his mind.</span></p></div>
