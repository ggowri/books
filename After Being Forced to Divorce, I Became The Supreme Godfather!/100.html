        <h1>Chapter 99 The Final Showdown</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well, Carolyn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason growled as he climbed to his feet amidst Carolyn and Jane's conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're on your last legs and still trying to bluff. Your time is up. My minions, attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The colossal sword was terrifying, and the tornado ravaged the heavens and the earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, that was the last of Carolyn's combat strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had planned to finish off Mason in one fell swoop, but her injuries were just too severe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason wasn't foolish. Seeing Carolyn spit out blood, he instantly realized she was on her last legs, merely bluffing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Mason's command, the werewolves from all directions howled to the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the vast Turner Manor was filled with the piercing howls that deafened the ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evil wolves ran rampant, and the earth shook.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolf army crossed the gates of Turner Manor, stepping over the wreckage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn gritted her teeth, her gaze sharp as she stared down the werewolf army, forcing herself to step forward with Jane following closely behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner, Ms. Ronald. Leave this to me. You should tend to your wounds first..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Carolyn and Jane were about to make a desperate stand, a group of people rushed over from the distance, led by the captain of the Turner Guards, Dariel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn turned to look, her eyes brightening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having just learned that the gates had been breached, she had assumed Dariel had fallen in battle for the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner, I'm not going to die just yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel explained, seeming to understand Carolyn's surprise, "I've taken the liberty of bringing the researchers. If the Turner family is in peril, no one is safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With their help, we can hold out a bit longer. Ms. Turner, you should tend to your wounds. I can still fight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn looked beyond Dariel to those behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A large group of people in white lab coats hurried over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were from the Turner Institute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family was a family of medical professionals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, the Turner family had produced several healing metahumans, formidable in their power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, for some reason, the bloodline was lost. For over a century, not a single healing metahuman had appeared until Rose came along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, Rose was the only healing metahuman in the Turner family, and she was the future of the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although there had been a gap in the healing power, the Turner family's pharmaceutical research had continued to develop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since then, their research and development had been increasingly biased towards healing medicines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner Institute was born from this, specializing in the study of curative medicines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each pharmacist was a top talent in this field, usually not involved in the various affairs of the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as Dariel said, with the Turner family now in grave danger, no one could stand aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, after being severely injured and unable to fight further, Dariel risked breaking family rules to bring the researchers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not because he feared death but to treat the wounded and reduce the casualties of the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This battle had been a heavy loss for the Turner family. With the pharmacists present, they could minimize the casualties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were not many researchers in the institute, about thirty to forty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the medicines they held were extraordinary and priceless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Warriors, a thousand days to train, one day to use."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel said, stepping past Carolyn to stand at the forefront of the crowd, raising his arm and shouting, "There's no need to speak of how the Turner family has treated us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, the Turner family faces great disaster, and I, Dariel, am willing to lead the charge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will fight for the honor of the Turner family, to the last drop of blood, without hesitation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Dariel's body shook, and a violent force swept through the surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In almost an instant, the power of the wolf metahuman was unleashed to its fullest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight for the honor of the Turner family, to the last drop of blood, without hesitation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight for the honor of the Turner family, to the last drop of blood, without hesitation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight for the honor of the Turner family..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Warriors, let's kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Defend the Turner family to the death! Kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolf army quickly gathered. Dariel led the charge, and members of the Turner Guards rushed in from all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each gate fell one after another. The defensive forces of the Turner family quickly converged, determined to make a final stand against the werewolf army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smoke quickly filled the air. Wails mixed with roars, and the howls and battle cries rose and fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The physicians of the Turner family also sprang into action immediately, handing a bottle of pills to Carolyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn took the bottle and passed it to Jane without hesitation. "Ms. Ronald, this is the Turner family's ancestral healing medicine. Have your people take it quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane wasted no words. She took the pills, distributed them to the others, and kept one for herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the Turner family had prepared enough pills over the years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The large number of Turner Guards brought by Dariel had taken the medicine earlier and were now full of vigor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The injection of new strength greatly boosted the morale of the Turner family, who fearlessly charged towards the werewolf army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the rear, Mason's gaze was dark and fierce, his eyes betraying a hint of undeniable urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A battle that should have been swift was delayed too long because of Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it was delayed any further, there would surely be trouble.</span></p></div>
