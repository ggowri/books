        <h1>Chapter 2 Punish Raina</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's mind reeled. His grandfather was the powerful Godfather of </span><span>Velmor</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was hard for him to grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No way. Had to be bullshit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Did Alvin and Anne pay these guys to mess with me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, he spotted a familiar figure striding toward him. It was Raina Smith, Anne's sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raina was more stunning than Anne, but her beauty was all poison. Ever since he'd married into the Smiths, she'd treated him like dirt under her heels, never missing a chance to </span><span>belittle</span><span> him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second she saw him, that signature sneer appeared. "Well, if it isn't the family loser! </span><span>Anne just called&mdash;she dumped you for Mr. Blake!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm here to toast her upgrade! You're nothing to us now. Bet you'll be eating from dumpsters soon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's all this? Putting on some sad little show?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's blood boiled. He turned to the old man and said, "That bitch's my enemy! If you're really here about my grandfather, then drag her here. Now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man nodded, then signaled to two bodyguards. They moved like lightning, locking Raina down before she could blink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raina screamed, "Get your hands off me, you animals! You're hurting me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell do you think you're doing, Anthony, you pathetic piece of</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>SLAP!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's hand left a red mark across her face, his lips twisting into something cruel. "Your whole </span><span>family's</span><span> treated me like trash. Time to learn who I really am. I'm the Godfather's heir. See these guys? They're taking me home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather? Don't make me laugh! You?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The heir? You're just a sad little nobody playing pretend!" Raina spat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>White-hot rage exploded in Anthony's head as he remembered Anne giving Alvin a blowjob right in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a blind rage, he grabbed Raina's throat, ripping her clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see who's nobody now! Everyone </span><span>turn</span><span> around!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, the old man and those guards around turn their backs, forming a solid wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In seconds, Anthony had Raina stripped bare against a luxury car's hood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, stop! You can't&mdash; Let me go, you bastard!" she screamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony ignored her protests, yanked down his pants to reveal a massive dick, and </span><span>slammed into her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raina fought at first, but as he pounded into her, her resistance melted away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck... slower... you're too rough! God, Anthony... you're incredible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He unleashed all his pent-up rage into her until she broke, collapsing like a rag doll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony zipped up, smirking. "Go tell your sister. I'll make her pay for everything!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And remember who I am - the Godfather's heir. The future Godfather!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Protected by the old man's crew, he slid into a luxury car and drove away, finally buying the old man's story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was about to meet his grandfather, the Godfather, for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, they pulled up to "Celestial Palace," some bougie mansion in the hills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside a dark chamber, Anthony found an imposing figure on a golden throne, power rolling off him in waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The figure gripped a black-gold staff. As Anthony stepped up, he knew</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>this was the legend who ran </span><span>Velmor</span><span>. The Godfather himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh, you're my grandfather?" he ventured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michael Johnson stayed </span><span>quiet,</span><span> eyes locked on Anthony. Then, a blue light flared in his left eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Devil Eye!" Anthony gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd seen that same power in his own eye, using that blue glow to save his ass more times than he could count. That same juice that got Anne her spot as the Smith family heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he knew was the name - Devil Eye. Everything else? </span><span>A t</span><span>otal mystery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never thought his grandfather would have the same thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michael's voice was deep and commanding. </span><span>"Devil Eye runs in Godfather blood only. You're my flesh and blood, kid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you ready to step up? Accept the Chosen Path and become my successor?"</span><span> </span></p></div>
