        <h1>Chapter 142 Impact</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben's eyes were bloodshot, and he hated Anthony!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After wiping off the blood slightly, the scar on his face became clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The horizontal scars on his face ran across his left and right cheeks and the bridge of his nose, and the vertical scars ran across his brow, the bridge of his nose and his chin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They crossed each other, with skin and flesh turned inside out and blood dripping, looking terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It happened in a flash. As Ben roared, the Black Cloak's fist had already smashed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was still the same as before, throwing a punch casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the result was the same as before. It was a powerful punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The floor tiles under the Black Cloak's feet exploded with a loud bang, and a visible air wave exploded where the two fists collided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrifying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the impact of the force, Anthony finally lost his balance and took several steps back. He steadied his steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Cloak was so strong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Warrior who had been famous for a long time was indeed extraordinary!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that the Black Cloak was very close to a Level B Warrior in terms of strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a sign of an imminent explosion after the power had settled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, this was a symbol of powerful strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking, Anthony was not panicked at all. Instead, he looked full of fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trash relying on drugs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Anthony knocked back by a punch, Ben was overjoyed and angrily cursed, "The Black Cloak is a true Warrior. This time, you must die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His drug-enhanced strength is nothing compared to Warrior's."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, no matter how strong he is by relying on drugs, he's still a loser."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. Kill him..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Ben spoke, others also started shouting, especially those from the Smith and Blake families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really have some skills!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the fistfight, the Black Cloak took a step back and sneered, "The medicine from the Godfather Research Institute shouldn't be underestimated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, if that's all, you are not qualified to shout here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke arrogantly, the Black Cloak shook his fist, looking disapproving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony snorted and said arrogantly, "Stop talking nonsense! Come on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This punch made Anthony deeply feel the burst of power of a Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Warriors, fighting was the fastest way to improve their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Cloak laughed grimly and said, "Well! You have courage!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have been in Yoland for so many years, and no one had ever dared to speak to me like this, not even the head of the Blake family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are the first, but you will also be the last."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as The Black Cloak said this, he ran quickly toward Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed was astonishing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was shocked. It seemed that the Black Cloak was angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of the Level A Warrior was fully unleashed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Anthony did not plan to open his Devil Eye. In this battle, he planned to fight with his own strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because he always felt that in previous battles, he had relied too much on Devil Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony knew that the Devil Eye was part of his power, but the duration of the Devil Eye was limited, which was its drawback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, this drawback might very likely become a fatal flaw under certain specific conditions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Anthony must maximize his fundamental strength to avoid it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Anthony was pondering, the Black Cloak rushed over like a hurricane, shouted loudly, and raised his hand to punch again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of this punch was obviously much stronger than the previous one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A punch was thrown out, and the wind was whistling!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a faint sound of detonation in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a powerful attack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Cloak was an orthodox Warrior. He must have practiced this for many years, so its power was certainly extraordinary!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people in the crowd looked stern and stared at the Black Cloak's fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, with the eyes of ordinary people, even if they were very focused, they could only see a flash of a figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bastard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is my unique skill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Cloak attacked with full force and shouted, "Over the years, there are only a few people who can withstand this punch from me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Loser, it is your great fortune to die under this punch of mine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This punch was very powerful, and the Black Cloak was confident!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony did not dare to be careless and subconsciously took a small step back. Then, he gathered the strength in his body into his right fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, with a loud shout, Anthony took another step forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A powerful force had faintly condensed into a small cyclone on Anthony's fist!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang! The next second, there was a loud collision, followed by a gust of wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dust on the ground rippled in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying force swept across an area of a few hundred feet!</span></p></div>
