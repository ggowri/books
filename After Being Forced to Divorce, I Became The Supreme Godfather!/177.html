        <h1>Chapter 176 A Threat</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to anyone else, Vincent's hatred for Anthony ran bone-deep. Back then, if it weren't for Anthony, Vincent could have silently killed Rose and taken over the Turner family without a hitch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anthony showed up out of nowhere, ruined </span><span>his</span><span> plans and forced </span><span>him</span><span> to kill Calvin to cover his tracks. Worse, Vincent had to flee to this godforsaken place to avoid the fallout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Vincent had no choice but to resort to this kind of underhanded method to seize control of the Turner family. Even though he told himself it didn't matter, it still left a bitter taste in his mouth, and he couldn't help but curse Anthony out in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grinding his teeth in frustration, Vincent finally said, "Those old bastards didn't cave because they're scared. They think Anthony's their precious savior. Fine. Let's see who </span><span>they run to after I put him in the ground."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then grumbled inwardly, "A savior? The Turner family's savior can only be me. Anthony? He's just nothing but a dead man walking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fueled by rage, Vincent dialed Anthony's number. The moment the call connected, Vincent </span><span>spat</span><span> venomously, "You really aren't dead yet, huh, you bastard? </span><span>Fuck</span><span> sake, you're tough as a damn cockroach."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was just about to tend to his injuries when he received </span><span>the </span><span>call. His tone was icy and sharp as he answered, "If you've got something to say, spit it out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent let out a strange chuckle and said disdainfully, "Here's some good news for you. Rose is still alive, and so is Carolyn. Oh, and let me add this&mdash;I've thrown in with the Evil Spirit Legion. In fact, I'm rallying all the major families of Yoland to join them too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't you brag about wiping out the Evil Spirit Legion and saving the Turner family? Great. I'm giving you a chance to prove yourself. If you've got the guts, come to the Mines to save them. I'd love to see what someone as useless as you&mdash;propped up by nothing but drugs&mdash;can actually do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony frowned at Vincent's words, a flicker of doubt crossing his mind. He had a whole plan in mind, and this threw a wrench in it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, Anthony thought Vincent would use Rose and Carolyn's lives to force the Elder Council to surrender and join the Evil Spirit Legion. But now, it seemed like Vincent's real target was him. If that was the case, Anthony felt things might actually become easier to handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony stayed silent, which only made Vincent sneer, "What's wrong, </span><span>loser</span><span>? Are you scared? Too late for that. Let me tell you, if you're not here by noon, I'll cut their heads off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truth was, Vincent didn't want Anthony to chicken out. After all, how else could he kill Anthony and get his revenge? And how else could Vincent rid himself of the so-called "savior" of the Turner family? That was why he made this call&mdash;to make sure Anthony would show up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent thought, "Anthony has to show up. </span><span>It's not just about m</span><span>y</span><span> grudge against him; he's repeatedly sabotaged the Evil Spirit Legion's plans.</span><span> </span><span>Archlord</span><span> </span><span>Iscairn</span><span> despises </span><span>him</span><span> to the core. If I can kill him, I'll definitely earn </span><span>Archlord</span><span> </span><span>Iscairn's</span><span> recognition."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And I'm not even worried about whether I can kill Anthony. If he dares to come, he's as good as dead. Even if </span><span>Necros</span><span> can't defeat him, the Four Demon Lords </span><span>are all here now</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With the Four Demon Lords joining forces, it's not just Anthony&mdash;even a Level C Metahuman or a Warrior wouldn't be able to take them on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The quieter Anthony was, the angrier Vincent became. "Speak up, you </span><span>son of a bitch</span><span>!" he snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony didn't stay silent for long. His voice came cold and steady as he said, "You'd better make sure they're safe, or I'll make you wish you were never born."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent chuckled darkly, "Very well. I'll be waiting for you then. You better show up." He then ended the call with a laugh, unable to hide his excitement. Turning to the Four Demon Lords, he said, "My Lords, Anthony will definitely come. This time, </span><span>there won't be any screw-ups, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Vincent was giddy with anticipation, a part of him wanted reassurance. After all, Lorcan had been so confident last time, claiming the Four Demon Lords were unstoppable and that killing Anthony would be as easy as squashing an ant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the outcome had been anything but; not only had Anthony survived, but he had also seriously injured </span><span>Necros</span><span>. That forced Vincent to reevaluate the strength of the Demon Lords. After all, in </span><span>his</span><span> mind, Anthony was nothing more than a washed-up loser&mdash;at best, a loser relying on drugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A</span><span>s soon as Vincent asked that question, the faces of the Four Demon Lords darkened instantly. Their expressions were ice cold. "Hm? Are you doubting our abilities, Vincent?" one of them asked, their voices laced with danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Vincent felt an invisible wave of murderous intent envelop him, sending a shiver down his spine. Panicked, he quickly stammered, "N-no, you misunderstand me, my Lords. I-I was just trying to be cautious. Anthony is a crafty piece of trash, and I was only thinking&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish explaining, Astaroth raised a hand, cutting him off with a low, commanding voice. "Enough. If Anthony doesn't come, then so be it. But if he does, he's dead. There won't be any mishaps. If he escapes again, we'll personally face </span><span>Archlord</span><span> </span><span>Iscairn</span><span> to atone for our failure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent breathed a sigh of relief, muttering nervously under his breath, "Good. That's good..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, Anne, who had been eavesdropping outside, felt a spark of inspiration. She walked into the hall with a confident air. She nodded politely and said, "My respects, Mr. Vincent Turner. Actually, if it's about killing Anthony, you don't even need the Four Demon Lords to lift a finger..."</span></p></div>
