        <h1>Chapter 109 The Soul Contract</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enhanced Inferno Gatling was a force to be reckoned with, but it came at a hefty price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At thirty thousand gold coins for the weapon and a staggering hundred gold coins per bullet, Anthony would have thought twice about purchasing such a powerful tool if the Turner family wasn't in dire straits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had just unleashed a barrage that cost him over ten thousand gold coins, but it was worth it to see the Devil Eye evolve, enhancing his overall strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Anthony faced Mason without fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His decision to have a one-on-one hit with Mason was to force the truth about the Evil Spirit Legion's attack on the Turner family out of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, no matter the cost, Anthony would have mowed down the werewolf army into oblivion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason, trembling and coughing up blood, looked utterly terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Anthony retracted his dragon power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason caught his breath, but he remained on the ground, quivering in fear, not daring to make a single move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dragon power was indeed formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For beast metahumans, it carried an innate aura of intimidation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony smiled down at Mason. "Mr. Foster, are you ready to answer my questions?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No... No..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason looked up, his face a picture of terror, yet he stubbornly shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? It seems you've lived too long."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's expression darkened as he summoned the dragon power once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Please don't..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason wailed, prostrating himself at Anthony's feet, begging for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony had a thought, "He doesn't want to speak. He dares not. This fear seems to come from the depths of his soul... A soul contract?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony finally realized something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To exert better control, the Evil Spirit Legion made every member sign a soul contract.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once bound by the contract, they appeared normal but were utterly loyal to the Evil Spirit Legion, willing to give everything, even their lives, for the cause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Understanding this, Anthony wasn't panicked. Instead, he laughed, "Look me in the eyes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason swallowed hard, his face trembling as he looked up, revealing a countenance etched with terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A vicious scar marred his face, giving him a menacing appearance at first glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, to Anthony's surprise, the man wasn't as old as he had expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He appeared to be in his thirties, exuding a strong, masculine aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had anticipated Mason to be a middle-aged man with a repulsive face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he seemed like an ordinary person, not even resembling a villain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nevertheless, Anthony didn't dwell on it. He asked again, "What's your name?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Arthur Hastings..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intimidation of the bloodline left Mason no choice but to comply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though his soul was ensnared, as long as Anthony's questions didn't pertain to the Evil Spirit Legion, he didn't seem to resist answering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How old are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thirty-six."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you join the Evil Spirit Legion?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Mason, or rather Arthur, shuddered again. He stammered, "I... I don't know. I truly don't know..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony didn't waste any more time. He said again, "Look me in the eyes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Arthur lifted his gaze to meet Anthony's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's eyes suddenly shimmered with a blue glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Devil Eye had the power to peer into one's soul, cleanse the heart, and command the spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment their eyes locked, Arthur's pupils contracted, and he stared blankly at Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes showed a struggle, and so did his body. He trembled anew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Anthony's brow furrowed, his expression growing serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, his anger dissipated, replaced by surprise and undeniable pity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Anthony probed deeper, Arthur struggled even more violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't just his body. His soul and consciousness were at war.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked in agony, his brow furrowed, his face contorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streamed down Arthur's face. He cried out to Anthony, "Kill... kill me. Please kill me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony ignored him. With a flicker in his eyes, a blue ray shot into Arthur's pupils.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Arthur stopped struggling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, the anger in his eyes faded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If you looked closely, Arthur's eyes seemed clearer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because Anthony had cleansed his soul with the power of the Devil Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, Anthony had broken his soul contract.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! Hannah! Mia!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I deserve to die! I truly deserve to die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hannah, Mia, wait for me! I'll be with you soon..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur shouted to the sky, sobbing uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he picked up a sharp blade from the ground and slashed it across his own neck.</span></p></div>
