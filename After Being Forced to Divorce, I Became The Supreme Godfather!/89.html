        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn! Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his attack missing once again, Mason completely lost control, roaring as he launched a fierce series of continuous attacks on Anthony!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like what Anthony did just now, Mason didn't intend to give him a chance to regroup!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was shocked and, not daring to engage in a direct confrontation, reluctantly chose to dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Foster, come on, kill him..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Foster, don't let Anthony get away..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Make this loser who dared to challenge Mr. Foster pay with blood!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Anthony fleeing in a panic, Anne and the others became excited, standing not far away, waving their arms and cheering for Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the fuel of anger, Mason transformed into a werewolf, his attacks becoming exceptionally fierce!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony fought while retreating, with Mason relentlessly pursuing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were engaged in an intense chase and fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a deafening roar came from the distance, causing the ground to shake violently!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd turned pale with shock and instinctively turned their heads to check what had just happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The noise came from the north gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They focused their gaze but could only vaguely see sand swirling in the sky, giant swords flashing, and wolves howling all around!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The huge noise echoed through most of the Turner Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Carolyn..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose shivered, instinctively pressing her lips together, trying her best to hide her concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far away, Anthony was also taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a loud commotion was enough to prove Carolyn's formidable combat strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She truly lived up to her reputation as a Level C metahuman, with strength that was hard to imagine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, such a powerful Carolyn had actually been trapped for so long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Mason was clearly fighting with him, and he really couldn't imagine who could have trapped Carolyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Evil Spirit Legion has other preparations, or perhaps they also dispatched a Level C metahuman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This thought frightened Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that case, the Turner family was truly in grave danger this time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While distracted, Anthony took a kick from Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was kicked flying. Under immense force, he crashed through the wall and flew into Turner Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After landing the kick, Mason stood proudly and sneered, "Foolish boy, are you waiting for Carolyn to save you? That's impossible now! Let me tell you, today you all will die, not a single one will survive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony gritted his teeth and got up, saying, "Stop boasting! Carolyn is a Level C metahuman! Not to mention a pack of wolf cubs, even if you face her yourself, you're </span><span>no match for her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason laughed out loud, his voice cold, "So what if she's a Level C metahuman?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I came here well-prepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Level C metahuman is indeed powerful, but I have a surprise prepared for her, an Earth Element array specifically designed to counter her power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I may not be able to immediately end her life, but with my preparations, I can certainly wear her out until she dies from exhaustion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, don't even think that anyone can come to save you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason's explanation was simple and clear, causing Anthony to be greatly shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason used the werewolf's Hematic Matrix!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier at the ballroom, he deliberately asked Jane about Mason, but she did not mention this kind of array that can also suppress elemental power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Either Jane didn't know enough about it, or the werewolves had made new breakthroughs in this area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Carolyn couldn't make it, all hope for this battle would be shattered!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Anthony's decision to hold back some of his strength was indeed because he was waiting for Carolyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because he knew that even if he fought with all his might, he wouldn't stand a chance against a Level B metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, he was waiting for Carolyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, not only could Carolyn not come to aid him, but she was also struggling to protect herself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing Anthony's silence, Mason sneered. "However, your power seems rather unusual. I can give you another chance. Kneel and subject yourself to me, and you may be spared!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason failed to notice the exceptional abilities of Devil Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Anthony's performance indeed surprised him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even relying on drugs, Anthony displayed astonishing power in this battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A person with such extraordinary talents must either become his subordinate or be eliminated as soon as possible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, Mason's seemingly conciliatory words were also a deadly test.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I refuse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony spat in disdain, keeping a wary eye on Mason while secretly activating the power of the Leopard Avatar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under his shirt, Anthony's limbs swelled at a visible rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He exuded a torrent of wild power from head to toe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn and the Turner family were currently at the brink of elimination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony could no longer afford to hold back; he had to go all out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Carolyn could survive, that would be best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, if she couldn't make it, Anthony must find a way to break through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the very least, he had to protect Rose!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose was crucial to the Chosen Path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony had a premonition that after completing the second plan, Devil Eye would </span><span>evolve further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After its evolution, he was confident in crushing all threats. Even if the Turner Manor was reduced to ruins, he had the ability to rebuild it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Rose was the key.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He might be able to give up Carolyn, but he must ensure Rose's safety!</span></p></div>
