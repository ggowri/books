        <h1>Chapter 164 Ambush</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, Rose, Carolyn, Sergio, and a group of over thirty people headed toward the </span><span>Virstino</span><span> Mountains in a long convoy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family's Mines were much closer to Yoland than Wolf Fang Valley, only about two to three hundred miles away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire journey was along well-maintained roads, so the convoy was moving at a steady pace without slowing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By dusk, they'd traveled halfway.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Up ahead, the road wound around a cliff. One side had a sheer drop, while the other side </span><span>had</span> <span>a steep rock face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This dangerous-looking path was the only way to get to the Mines, as it had been built specifically by the Turner family for mining purposes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite how it looked, it was actually very safe</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>Wide</span><span> with four lanes and sturdy guardrails all along thirty miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd been driving this route for over ten years, so the Turner family was very familiar with it and never felt it was dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were eight off-road vehicles in total. The first one was driven by the Turner family's personal guards, the second by Sergio, the vice-captain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The third had Rose and Carolyn inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they drove higher into the mountains, Rose started to feel uneasy. Her discomfort grew as they climbed the cliffs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She discreetly pulled out her phone to try and reach Anthony, but there was no signal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She frowned, puzzled. There had always been coverage here before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her unease didn't go unnoticed by Carolyn. "Rose, </span><span>you</span><span> okay? You don't look like yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose blinked and quickly tried to brush it off. "Oh, it's nothing... Just tried to use my phone, but there's no signal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No signal?" Carolyn sounded doubtful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She checked her own phone, and sure enough, there was no service. "That's weird. This place has signal coverage, </span><span>and </span><span>even the Mines have service..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish, Carolyn's eyes narrowed, scanning the road ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mountains stretched out in front of them, the green hills bathed in the glow of the setting sun, mist curling up from the valleys.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything looked calm on the surface, but Carolyn's gut told her something was wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop the car," she said suddenly, grabbing the radio.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her instincts were never wrong. She'd led the Turner family for years, and the sense of </span><span>fear</span><span> she felt wasn't random.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even after she gave the order, the convoy kept moving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp turn ahead was the only dangerous spot on the entire road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they neared it, the vehicles still hadn't slowed down. Carolyn's patience snapped. "Sergio, I said stop the damn car!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a brief pause, then Sergio's voice came through. "Got it, Ms. Carolyn Turner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the convoy slowed down just before the sharp bend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, Ms. Carolyn Turner, I got distracted for a moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? Why are we stopping?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sergio had been with the Turner family for over ten years, and he was deeply loyal to them, especially to Carolyn, who valued him highly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of that, he respected her, but their relationship felt more like equals than a typical boss-subordinate dynamic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Something just doesn't feel right. Send someone ahead to check."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn didn't mind the lapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had driven this road countless times, so it wasn't surprising that Sergio was a little too relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it, Ms. Carolyn Turner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sergio jumped into action and sent his vehicle ahead to investigate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Carolyn had instructed him to send someone ahead to check, Sergio seemed to sense the need for extra caution and took the lead himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw him take charge, Carolyn couldn't help but feel a sense of relief. She had complete trust in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as the vehicles rounded the bend, an earsplitting explosion rocked the air, the sound like a bomb going off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose and Carolyn both jerked in their seats, eyes wide as they looked ahead. Dust and smoke filled the road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sergio's car had already turned the corner, and they couldn't see what was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn grabbed the radio, her voice sharp and panicked. "Sergio, what's going on?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, get out of the cars, now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Protect Ms. Carolyn Turner!" Sergio's voice crackled urgently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could say anything more, the radio buzzed with static.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, get out of the cars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn didn't hesitate and immediately ordered her people to evacuate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was about to leap out, a flash of light came from the mountain cliff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A grenade hurtled down toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rose!" Carolyn shouted in alarm, grabbing Rose and yanking her </span><span>closer</span><span>. Without thinking, she kicked the door open and jumped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They landed hard on the ground just as the grenade hit the vehicle, engulfing it in flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The explosion's shockwave knocked Carolyn and Rose off their feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the vehicle, ther</span><span>e were</span><span> four people. The others hadn't gotten out in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire car was consumed by fire, and a hot gust of air slammed into them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Carolyn pulled Rose backward, eyes scanning the cliffside, fury and disbelief flooding her chest. "Who the hell dares to ambush us?!"</span></p></div>
