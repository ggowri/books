        <h1>Chapter 190 Abbott Cave</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whistling sound of something cutting through the air grew closer by the second, moving at a frightening speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Holy crap</span><span>!" Anthony silently cursed as he pushed himself to run even faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could pick up speed, blood suddenly spurted from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His legs gave out beneath him, causing him to stumble forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The previous night's battle had left Anthony seriously wounded, and he hadn't given himself time to recover before rushing to the Mines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body simply couldn't handle the strain of new injuries piling onto unhealed ones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony!" Rose cried out in alarm. She quickly reached out to catch him as he stumbled. "Here, lean on me. We need to hurry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mid-sentence, Rose suddenly paused, her eyes widening in surprise. "Anthony, I think... I think my powers are coming back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, she focused her energy, channeling her healing power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, waves of powerful healing energy flowed from her hands through Anthony's arm, spreading throughout his entire body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony drew in a deep, satisfying breath, like a man drinking water after days in the desert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The color began returning to his pale face, and he could feel his depleted energy </span><span>rapidly restoring itself to normal levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his strength finally restored, Anthony wasted no time. He scooped Rose into his arms and burst into motion, his speed almost defying physics as he covered dozens of yards in mere seconds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony! There's nowhere to run! Face your death!" a voice roared behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The furious howl seemed to chase him like his own shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Anthony dared to glance back, he saw a dark figure moving like a wraith, gliding just above the ground at an impossible speed. His blood ran cold when he spotted the gr</span><span>een</span><span> sash around the figure's waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Fuck no</span><span>," Anthony muttered under his breath. This was Astaroth, the leader of the Four Demon Lords.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony pushed himself harder, running faster than he'd ever run in his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't cowardice&mdash;he was just being realistic. In his current state, he stood no chance against Astaroth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His instincts screamed that he wouldn't last ten seconds in a direct fight with Astaroth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, a massive tree came hurtling through the air like a comet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its trunk was as thick as a grown man's waist, whistling through the air with devastating force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When it finally crashed down, the impact was so powerful that it shattered the rocky ground, with a third of the trunk embedding itself deep into the mountain stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The display of raw power was almost beyond belief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's blood ran cold as his eyes followed the tree's trajectory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>About three hundred feet ahead lay a massive ravine. Its depths were lost in shadow, but its width stretched well over sixty feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dark mist rose ominously from the black valley below, while the opposite side was covered in dense, forbidding forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something felt deeply wrong about the whole scene, but Anthony couldn't afford to dwell on it&mdash;not when their lives were on the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on tight!" he shouted, scooping Rose up in his arms. He channeled every ounce of power he had into his legs. There was no turning back now. It was do or die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" Rose's eyes widened in horror as she realized where they were. "Anthony, stop! This is Abbott Cave! It's forbidden territory in the </span><span>Virstino</span><span> Mountains! You can't&mdash;" Her warning was cut short as they launched into the air, her words lost to the wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony pushed his body to its absolute limit, risking everything as he launched himself into the air with Rose in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They soared upward like human projectiles, reaching an impossible height as they aimed for the opposite cliff face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it wasn't enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Halfway through their desperate leap, Anthony's heart sank as the brutal reality hit him&mdash;they'd only cleared two-thirds of the distance. The momentum that had carried them this far began to fade, and gravity took hold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They plummeted into the darkness below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The valley beneath them was a haunting sight, filled with dense vegetation Anthony had never seen before. Most disturbingly, the plants bore an unnatural black hue that </span><span>seemed to drink in what little light reached them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Abbott Cave?" The thought flashed through Anthony's mind. "What kind of forbidden place is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they fell, Rose's terrified scream echoing in his ears, Anthony's mind became crystal clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they were falling too fast&mdash;the ground was rushing up to meet them with deadly speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fall from this height would be fatal, or at the very least, leave them broken beyond repair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that split second, Anthony twisted his body, trying to position himself underneath Rose to absorb the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could complete the movement, he saw a flash of determination in Rose's eyes. With surprising strength, she grabbed him and reversed their positions, pushing him above her. "Anthony, I got this&mdash;" she shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rose, no!" Anthony's heart froze as he desperately tried to switch their positions back, but it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose's body suddenly pulsed with energy as a visible mist rose from her form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The water vapor quickly condensed into a massive sphere, completely enveloping both of them. Below the aqueous globe, a shield-like barrier of mist formed for additional protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of splintering wood echoed through the forest as they crashed through the ancient trees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It happened in the blink of an eye&mdash;the shield materialized just as they smashed through countless massive trunks before slamming violently into the ground below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact was catastrophic, like an earthquake splitting the earth. The protective water sphere exploded on contact, dissipating instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive crater, several yards deep, appeared where they landed, sending clouds of dust billowing outward for hundreds of feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that same moment, an almost imperceptible dark energy began seeping from where they had fallen. It spread silently in all directions, quickly engulfing the entire valley before vanishing without a trace.</span></p></div>
