        <h1>Chapter 47 Clearing His Name</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel glared at Anthony, his teeth clenched in frustration. "You claim you protected Ms. Turner. Where's your evidence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony shot back angrily, "I've killed countless people and nearly lost my own life. Isn't that proof enough? Besides, I doubt Rose and Helen would pin the blame on me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to know where this accusation against me is coming from. Did Helen and Rose actually say I was the murderer?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I demand to confront them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, his rage boiled over, and he shouted, his eyes blazing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel, witnessing Anthony's outburst, hesitated. He had come to escort Rose and Helen, but in the frenzy of the chase for the real killer, he hadn't had a chance to gather details.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon returning to the Turner Manor after his failed mission, he found that Rose and Helen were under tight security, and even he, the captain of the guard, couldn't get access to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, he received orders from the family leaders stating that Anthony was the murderer who had fled the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Dariel was tasked with hunting him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, facing Anthony, he sensed something was off. It didn't seem like Anthony was lying. Could there be more to this story?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel quickly began to analyze the situation in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Anthony also reached out to his Devil Eye for assistance. "Devil Eye, what do you make of this?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By activating his Devil Eye, Anthony could read Dariel's micro-expressions and gauge his sincerity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Devil Eye responded, "Based on the target's body language, including his expressions, tone, and eye movements, it appears he feels guilty for not arriving in time to protect Rose, which nearly led to her death. He seems eager to catch the real killer to alleviate his guilt. Overall, it suggests he is not the murderer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony exhaled in relief. He actually had a positive impression of Dariel and believed they could become allies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing Dariel wasn't the murderer eased his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Dariel cleared, Anthony considered other potential suspects within the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he realized he needed to win Dariel over to his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Anthony smirked, "Dariel, why the silence? Feeling guilty? Let me tell you, you're the most suspicious one here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you aren't the actual killer, your dereliction of duty can't be overlooked. Do you acknowledge that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with Anthony's logic, Dariel flushed with anger. "Yes. But I will catch the real murderer and clear my name!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony smiled, "I feel the same way. Why don't we team up to find the killer and clear both our names?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel scoffed, "Who do you think you are? How dare you ask for my cooperation? I can catch the murderer on my own. Until your name is cleared, you're not welcome in </span><span>Turner Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone, arrest him and throw him in the dungeon. We'll make a decision after the truth comes out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The decision to imprison Anthony rather than kill him suggested Dariel had reservations about Anthony being the true culprit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin chimed in immediately, "Yes! Even if he's not the one who killed her, he has to be involved. Lock him up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Representatives of the other families echoed, "This guy has ulterior motives. He came to the Dragon Guild just to get close to Ms. Turner, waiting for a chance to attack her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Captain Stein, we must investigate this thoroughly and not let him slip away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne, with a mixture of pride and disdain, added, "Anthony, did you hear that? Don't think your brief interaction with Ms. Turner at the Dragon Guild makes you someone special who deserves an invitation to the Turner family event.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't deserve it. You're nothing but the bastard I kicked out of my family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony remained calm. He had swayed Dariel's opinion, and the next step was clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed his gaze on Dariel, a sly smile creeping onto his face. "What if I told you I came here today with a big gift for Ms. Turner? I can help find the real murderer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you say?" Dariel asked, visibly agitated. "Do you know where the murderer is? Tell me now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony shook his head. "Not yet. The murderer will reveal himself when the time is right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But let me make this clear: I was invited as a distinguished guest to the party. Let me in. Otherwise, if I leave now, you'll never uncover the true killer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel studied Anthony thoughtfully. "Are you serious, or are you just messing with me? Can you really take responsibility for what you're saying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely," Anthony replied confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel gritted his teeth. "Fine. If that's the case, I'll let you in. But on one condition: you have to defeat me in a fight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony frowned. "You want to fight me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Dariel said firmly. "If you can't even beat me, then your claims about protecting Ms. Turner from the werewolves are nothing but lies. I know the strength of those creatures&mdash;there's no way you could have taken them on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only if you defeat me will I believe your words. Are you scared, loser?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Dariel took a defensive stance, a look of challenge on his face.</span></p></div>
