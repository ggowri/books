        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, yes...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry, let's kneel and greet Mr. Foster..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Anne spoke, Scarlet immediately reacted, signaling for everyone to kneel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she casually glanced at Anthony, who passed by them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His well-defined muscles and sharp features radiated intense masculinity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Striding forward with confidence, cold yet commanding, he exuded an air of power and authority that was simply captivating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, Scarlet felt a bit dazed, her mind drifting back to the time in Anne's apartment, where she and Anthony had shared moments of intense passion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling uneasy, Scarlet dryly swallowed, instinctively pressing her legs together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, quickly kneel and greet Mr. Foster..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry, hurry, Mr. Foster will be back soon. We can't afford to offend him..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlet knelt down, and soon, others followed suit. A chorus of voices echoed as they knelt with sincerity and urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, observing the devotion and efficiency with which they knelt, couldn't help but glance back in mild disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So many foolish people, yet not one of them was outside the inner circle of Yoland's elite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The city was ruled by these individuals, and that was a troubling thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His resolve solidified: he had to change the fate of Yoland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the others knelt, Anthony pushed through the crowd and walked straight to Rose's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged a smile, and Anthony gently wrapped his arm around her slender waist. Surprised, he said, "My love, you've broken through too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Rose replied with a sweet smile, leaning her head against his shoulder. "How are you? Did you get hurt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony shook his head, teasing her. "After your sweet nurturing, I feel like I have boundless energy. I'm stronger than ever..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he playfully rubbed her waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose shuddered slightly, her cheeks turning pink as she mumbled. "Stop it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought to herself, "He was already as strong as an ox before, and now even stronger? That would be incredible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their public display of affection drew envious glances from many.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose was recognized as the goddess of Yoland&mdash;beautiful as an angel, with an ethereal aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many were excited just to glimpse her beauty, and seeing Anthony hold her so intimately made them wish for that kind of attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, not everyone was pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin growled through gritted teeth. "You worthless fool! Get over here and kneel down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rose!" Anne snapped, her voice filled with venom. "You too, get over here and kneel before Mr. Foster!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, how dare you! Now that Mr. Foster had defeat you, kneel now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony shot Anne a weary glance and impatiently replied, "Shut up. Who told you that I've submitted to the Evil Spirit Legion?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you that I killed the werewolf leader. If you want to kneel, you can kneel as long as you like..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're talking nonsense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, stop bluffing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Anthony could finish, Alvin interrupted. "How dare you speak like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you hadn't submitted to Mr. Foster, how could you have survived?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly!" Anne chimed in. "Oh I see. You must have pretended to submit, and then returned early to try to take the Turner family and run, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, how dare you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you play tricks on Mr. Foster? You're asking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furious, Anne turned to the werewolf army, barking orders. "Why are you standing there? Surround them! Don't let them escape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Surround them! Anthony is trying to run away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin jumped up, shouting. "Just to be safe, capture them, or just kill them outright..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang! Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, Anthony pulled out the Inferno Gatling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a word, he fired a quick burst at the werewolf army hiding behind cover!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The solid wall exploded with a thunderous sound, countless bullets shredding it to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolves behind it screeched as they scrambled to flee in every direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a furious roar, Anthony shouted. "Otherwise, I'll kill every last one of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Inferno Gatling&mdash;a weapon of mass destruction!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blinding blue glow of the barrels and the terrifying bullets that could crush rocks and split stones created an awe-inspiring spectacle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolves hesitated, shivering in fear. None dared approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the power of these bullets was so immense that even a single hit would turn them to dust without a chance to fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They may be werewolves, but they were not fearless warriors willing to die without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, without their leader, they were just a scattered group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whoever confronted the Inferno Gatling would die instantly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be afraid!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His Gatling may be powerful, but he only has one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne, seeing the hesitation of the werewolves, issued another order. "Attack from all sides at once! He won't be able to stop all of you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just charge and kill him! Do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who do you think you are, giving orders to us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, before Anne could speak, one of the werewolves snapped. "You've been yelling nonstop! Why don't you go up yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..." Anne was stunned, her mouth hanging open, unable to respond.</span></p></div>
