        <h1>Chapter 137 A Small Fry</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony couldn't help but laugh at Timothy's arrogant demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These guys must have rocks for brains," he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you laughing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell are you laughing at?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Enraged by Anthony's smile, Timothy charged forward, shouting, "Get on your knees, you piece of shit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy's fist, fueled by fury, shot out with lightning speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in the day, such a punch would have definitely knocked Anthony down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately for Timothy, the current Anthony was no longer the same pushover, a fact Timothy remained blissfully ignorant of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Anthony unfazed, a smug grin spread across Timothy's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Imagine the notoriety he'd gain if he could bring Anthony to his knees with a single punch right here in front of everyone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>BAM!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Timothy was gloating internally, Anthony suddenly moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All Timothy saw was a foot shooting towards him like lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next instant, a searing pain exploded in his chest as if he'd been slammed by a speeding train. He let out a yelp and went flying backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Timothy could even process what happened, he was sent flying over 20 feet, smashing through a wall and landing in the Smith Manor's courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy violently coughed as he crashed to the ground, spitting out a mouthful of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you, you..." he sputtered, struggling to lift his head and look at Anthony, trying to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his injuries were too severe. After a few desperate attempts, he failed to utter a single word. His head slumped to the side, and he passed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" The crowd, which had been reveling in the spectacle moments before, was now stunned. They instinctively took a few steps back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was too sudden. Timothy had been so confident when he launched his attack that everyone had assumed Anthony was doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the blink of an eye, Timothy was the one taken down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Loser!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned his cold gaze to Anne standing behind the crowd and spoke in a deep voice. "Anne, do you know why I came today?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's because I want everyone to know what you really are nothing but a whore who </span><span>begged me to fuck you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was the Smith family really conspiring with the Evil Spirit Legion to take over Yoland?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's ambition was undeniable, but she was way out of her league.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You! You Bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Anthony's outburst, Anne's face twisted into an ugly snarl. She waved her hand and snapped, "Ben, what are you waiting for?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him! Now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne had no intention of explaining, not that she needed to anyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, today, Anthony was as good as dead. Once he was gone, who would care about anything he'd said?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony! You worthless piece of trash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben stepped out from the crowd, his eyes blazing with murderous intent. "You're nothing but a junkie who relies on drugs for power, and you dare cause trouble for the Smith family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think that just because you've pumped yourself full of drugs, you can look down on everyone?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, I'll show you just how much of a difference there is between drug-fueled power and natural strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ben spoke, his body tensed, and a series of sharp cracking sounds erupted from his bones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Powerful energy coursed through his limbs, radiating an impressive aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Warrior? Did Ben break through?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, not quite Warrior level, but Ben's power is almost there..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This kind of strength is practically Warrior class. Anthony's toast now, that loser..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You got that right. With a Warrior at the helm, the Smith family's power is climbing to new heights. What was Anthony thinking, causing trouble here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hah! He's just trash who got a temporary power boost from some drugs. Talk about overestimating himself..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was initially shocked by Ben's overwhelming aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then their expressions turned gleeful as they looked at Anthony, eager to watch him fail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To ordinary people, Warriors were legendary figures whose power was beyond imagination. No one dared to underestimate a Warrior's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Anthony was just a loser who, at best, was a regular guy who got a bit stronger using some enhancement drugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap between an average person and someone nearly at Warrior level was evident to everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anthony just laughed internally at their reactions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nearly at Warrior level? Practically to a Warrior?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What nonsense logic was this? A Warrior was a Warrior! What did 'practically' even mean?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These ignorant fools."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being close to Warrior level wasn't the same as being a Warrior. The difference in power was like heaven and earth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, Ben wasn't even a real Warrior yet. But even if he was, why should Anthony be afraid?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With power surging through his body, Ben glared at Anthony with wide eyes and roared, "Don't accuse me of bullying! Aren't you able to boost your strength with drugs?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't want to die pathetically, I'll give you plenty of time to take your drugs first!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But," he sneered, "I'll make damn sure you learn that drugs are just drugs, and trash will always be trash, just like you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony chuckled softly, hands casually tucked in his pockets. "Just get on with it, why all the bluster?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think I need drugs to deal with a small fry like you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ben, aren't you getting a little ahead of yourself?"</span></p></div>
