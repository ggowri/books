        <h1>Chapter 11 Seraph</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was almost at the door when a furious shout echoed behind him. A powerful pressure hit him like a concrete wall, and his face went pale in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately recognized it was a Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mission here wasn't just for revenge but also to test the full power of his Devil Eye. What seemed like an impulsive outburst was actually the result of careful planning. The Smith family's top bodyguard, Ben, was a fighter who nearly had the strength of a Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony had believed he could handle Ben without any trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he was right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he didn't anticipate, however, was the presence of a Warrior hiding in plain sight at what appeared to be a simple banquet. The Smith family, despite their status, didn't have the resources to hire such a person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only families with assets over ten billion, like the Blake family, could afford to employ Warriors as personal guardians. These Shadow Sentinels usually stayed in the shadows, only revealing themselves when their families faced life-threatening danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, today, Anthony had underestimated the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the crushing pressure, he felt his breath freeze, as though the air around him </span><span>had thickened to the consistency of quicksand. His body was paralyzed, unable to move. It felt like he would be shattered into pieces at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a moment of panic, Anthony screamed, unleashing the final burst of energy from his Devil Eye. He spun around in a flash, pulling out the gun he'd gotten from Timothy and firing at the assailant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything happened too quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Cloak had been certain that Anthony would be easy prey, never imagining that in such a critical moment, Anthony would not only turn around but also be armed with a gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was still in mid-air when he saw the dark muzzle of the gun. Letting out a growl, he activated a surge of energy, blocking the bullet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bullet pierced through the force field, its angle off and its power greatly reduced, striking him in the right chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grunted, stumbling backward and crashing to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Anthony was knocked back by the residual shockwave of the Black Cloak's energy, sent flying through the air before hitting the ground with a heavy thud. His vision blurred, and blood spilled from his mouth as he struggled to stay conscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's been injured by Shadow Sentinel! Quickly, capture him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin screamed, frantic with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben reacted instantly, leading his men into pursuit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the last of his strength, Anthony pushed himself to his feet and sprinted toward a nearby alley, firing his gun behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wild spray of bullets slowed his pursuers' progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's out of ammo!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Anthony emptied the clip, Ben and his men rushed forward, shouting in unison, closing in fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony discarded the gun and jumped onto the Hellfire Bike he'd hidden behind a corner. With a twist of the throttle, the engine roared to life, and the bike shot forward like a rocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quick, get in the cars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben barked orders to his men, who piled into eight vehicles and sped off, surrounding him from both the front and the back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, relying on the last of his willpower, tore down the road toward the outskirts of the city, aiming for Celestial Palace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his strength was running out fast, and his vision was growing dim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was so tired that all he wanted was to close his eyes and fall asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Anthony sped forward, the sound of gunfire echoed from the cars chasing him, bullets whizzing past on both sides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when he thought he was about to meet his end, something incredible happened. From the dark sky ahead, an angel appeared, her golden wings shimmering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She held a golden submachine gun and began unloading it on the cars behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben and his men screamed in panic, swerving their cars to avoid the barrage of bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The angel slowly descended, drawing closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through his blurry vision, Anthony caught a glimpse of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Johnson, you're exhausted. It's time to rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the angel opened her arms and gently scooped him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's head rested against her soft chest, the sensation like lying on a cloud. For a moment, he felt as if he was back in his mother's embrace, and the exhaustion finally overwhelmed him. He drifted into unconsciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a powerful flap of her golden wings, the angel soared into the sky, vanishing into the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the cars behind, one of the team members, wide-eyed, asked, "Sir, what the hell was that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben, still shaken, slowly lifted his head from the back seat, his voice trembling. "I... I don't know. We'll have to ask the Blake family's Shadow Sentinel when we get back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An angel with golden wings?" The black-robed elder, who had been injured by Anthony's gunfire, thought for a moment and then spoke grimly, "Could it be an avian Metahuman? A bird-man, maybe?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever she is, if she's helping Anthony, she's my enemy now! I'll tear them both apart!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Black Cloak, do you think you can handle this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin's voice was full of fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was consumed by hate for Anthony, and he swore to do whatever it took to hunt him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elder paused, then answered, "Sir, my responsibility is to protect the family. As for hunting down enemies, you'll have to find someone else for that. But if anyone dares to attack the Blake family fortress, I will step in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin gripped Anne's hand tightly, his face twisted with anger. "We'll use both our families' influence to hire Yoland's eighteen assassins. We'll issue a manhunt for Anthony!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne thought for a moment before replying, "Tomorrow's the trading day at Dragon Guild. To make the manhunt more credible, we should form an alliance there. We'll vow to stop at nothing until Anthony is dead."</span></p></div>
