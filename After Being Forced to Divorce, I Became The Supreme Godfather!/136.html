        <h1>Chapter 135 Do It Again</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kneel down?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's angry shout echoed throughout the Smith Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, Anne and Alvin strutted over, surrounded by their entourage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look who we have here, huh? Turner family lapdogs..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne pushed through the crowd and spotted Dariel, she sneered as she shot Anthony a cold look. "Trash will always be trash. I was wondering how you dared to act so arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It turns out you have the Turners protecting you, you coward!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin swaggered over, laughing scornfully. "Seems like I was right," he sneered. "You're nothing but a pretty-boy freeloader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A grown man hiding behind a woman's skirt. What a coward!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony had indeed arrived, but he brought the Turner family with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Anne and Alvin naturally assumed Anthony had pledged allegiance to the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alvin, do you have a death wish?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Anthony could even respond to their mockery, Dariel exploded with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Completely forgetting Anthony's earlier warning, she clenched her fist, ready to punch Alvin's lights out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calm down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony stepped in to block his path. "Captain Stein, let's not be hasty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone knows Mr. Blake isn't a real man anyway. Why waste your time on someone like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words sent a ripple through the room, and many instinctively glanced at Alvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quite a few people had seen the video that Anthony had publicly released at the engagement banquet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>News of it had spread throughout Yoland in the past few days, but everyone had been hesitant to mention it, given the Blake family's influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet now, in front of everyone, Anthony had brought it up again, and right in front of Alvin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard, Anthony! I'll fucking kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected, Alvin exploded at the mention of it, his eyes bulging with rage as he lunged forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got a death wish?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Alvin could reach him, Dariel stepped forward to shield Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin was seeing red now. "Dariel, don't think being from the Turner family means you can look down on everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is Smith family territory, not your Turner family playground!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what's so great about the Turner family anyway?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Foster will be here soon. If the Turner family doesn't wise up, Mr. Foster won't let you off easy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you know what's good for you, get out of my way right now. Otherwise, you'll be the first one I take down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Evil Spirit Legion was coming!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those words sent a chill down Dariel's spine. He had to admit this was a genuine concern for the Turner family right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The very reason Carolyn sent Dariel was precisely for this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing Dariel's darkening expression, Anne smirked, crossing her arms. "Looks like the Turner family can barely keep themselves afloat, huh?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, I really wonder how a worthless piece of trash like you got the Turner family to go all out for your sake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Turner family might be able to protect you now, but they can't shield you forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And from today on, the Turner family will lose their foothold in Yoland completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Soon enough, the Smith family will take their place and become the sole rulers of Yoland."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps because she'd received news about the Evil Spirit Legion first, Anne was already treating herself and the Smith family as members of the organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or rather, she'd already fantasized about their imminent future, rising to power, soaring to the top, becoming Yoland's rulers!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd even started treating these grand delusions as reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony let out a sneer, waving off Dariel once again. "I've never needed anyone's protection, and the Smith family will never replace the Turner family. Never!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop acting tough, Anthony!" Anne let out a cold snort, staring at him with contempt. "Don't need anyone's protection? Weren't you running for your life from Mr. Foster just the other day?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Weren't you hiding behind a woman like a coward?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why keep up this act when we all know the truth?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You came to the Smith family today because you're scared Mr. Foster will go after you, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's cut to the chase! Get on your knees before me, the head of the Smith family. Bow down and beg for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I'm in a good mood, I might consider sparing your worthless life. You can stay as my obedient dog!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's arrogance was becoming impossible to hide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her haughty expression showed how desperately she wanted Anthony to kneel and prostrate before everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin burst out laughing and joined in the taunting. "She's right, Anthony. Why keep pretending when we all know what you are?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone knows you're just a freeloader living off others!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rose isn't here anyway, so just bow down and save your skin. Makes sense, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Blake is right! Get on your knees!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A freeloader like you has no pride to protect anyway!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you waiting for? Kneel down already..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What started with Alvin's taunts quickly spread as he encouraged others to join in. Soon, the whole crowd was shouting in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's gaze darkened as he stepped forward, a cold smirk playing on his lips. "Anne, since you love kneeling so much, why not do it again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, you've done it before&mdash;begging me to fuck you, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alvin, I bet you didn't know this, huh?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anne, my ex-wife, your fiancee. Even after you two got engaged, she was on her knees, crying and begging me to screw her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, my bad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I almost forgot.. you're not much of a man, are you? That's why you can't satisfy her. So, of course, she'd come back to me, begging for what I could give her, isn't that right?"</span></p></div>
