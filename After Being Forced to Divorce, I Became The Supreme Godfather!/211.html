        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Mordred had said, Astaroth had merely been careless for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, Anthony's reaction and counterattacks had left him</span><span> </span><span>astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Astaroth was a Level B Warrior, blessed with immense natural strength and extraordinary defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, after being forced back by Anthony, Astaroth's rage surged, and his fury-fueled return boosted his combat strength to a terrifying level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Empowered by his overwhelming strength, Astaroth dodged Anthony's fierce attack and landed a punch that sent Anthony flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Anthony was thrown through the air, a surge of alarm shot through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Astaroth's power was indeed formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this had been back when he first encountered Astaroth, Anthony doubted he could have lasted even ten rounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that was then, and this was now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he appeared disheveled after being struck, there wasn't the slightest hint of panic on Anthony's face. Instead, a fiery fighting spirit burned brightly in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His entire body seemed to swell with power, muscles bulging to the point of nearly tearing apart his already tattered and battered clothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the tears in his clothes, the raised veins crisscrossing his body could be seen clearly, like a sprawling web covering him from head to toe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You little punk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Astaroth charged toward him, bellowing, "It was just a moment of </span><span>distraction</span><span>, and you dare spout such arrogant nonsense?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, I'll make yo</span><span>u</span><span> wish you were dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he charged, a ferocious energy erupted from Astaroth, enveloping his towering frame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His massive form seemed to grow even taller, and his muscles swelled to a degree even more exaggerated than Anthony's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spit," Anthony turned his head and spat out a mouthful of dust, then curled his lips into a wicked smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered, "Your strength is indeed impressive, but it's far from enough. Not nearly enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his words fell, Anthony raised his fist abruptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It collided squarely with Astaroth's punch. The moment they struck, a dull, deafening thud echoed in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beneath their feet came a crisp cracking sound, this was the sound of rock breaking beneath the thick layers of dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was, after all, a mining area, and the layer of dust beneath them was several inches deep. Looking closely, one could see both men's feet had sunk deeply into the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impossible! How could you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the punch landed, Astaroth's expression changed drastically, his eyes wide with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish his sentence, Anthony let out a cold chuckle and said, "</span><span>Y</span><span>ou </span><span>t</span><span>hink you were the only one who could amplify your strength?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you're </span><span>that </span><span>strong? </span><span>Let me</span><span> show you what real power looks like!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Anthony's words fell, he gave a sudden shake of his arm, releasing a surge of tremendous energy that forced Astaroth back three steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Anthony's shoulders trembled, and his already bulging muscles swelled further. He took a step forward, choosing to go on the offensive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His muscles seemed on the verge of exploding, and his entire body radiated an overwhelming aura of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Astaroth's face darkened, and he instinctively threw a punch to the counter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his hurried punch lacked sufficient force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a muffled thud, Astaroth stumbled back another step, his heart filled with unparalleled shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet before he could process it, Anthony struck again and again, each blow fiercer than the last, like an unstoppable avalanche.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Astaroth roared in fury, shouting, "I</span><span>'</span><span>m </span><span>gonna</span><span>..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, Anthony's sharp voice interrupted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaping into the air, Anthony's right leg lashed out like a whip, slicing through the air with a sharp, whistling sound as it aimed directly for Astaroth's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His attacks came like a relentless tide, one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fists, kicks, elbows, knees, shoulders, every part of Anthony's body seemed to become a weapon for assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strikes were swift and seamless, their transitions smooth and fluid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Astaroth's reliance on defense and his self-proclaimed invincibility due to his immense strength, he was now being forced back step by step, completely unable to fight back against Anthony's onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Astaroth, Anthony didn't seem all that powerful on the surface. But every time he attacked, Anthony's moves seemed to perfectly counter his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All his raw strength was rendered useless, and he could only rely on his exceptional defenses to endure wave after wave of Anthony's relentless assaults.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the distance, the onlookers were dumbfounded. Eyes widened in </span><span>disbelief,</span><span> they </span><span>stared at Anthony as though they had seen a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, one could still attribute the situation to Astaroth's carelessness. But now, this was clearly something entirely different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's physique was a full head shorter than Astaroth's, yet his attacks were far more ferocious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Johnson is going to win! He's going to win!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Carolyn Turner, Astaroth isn't a match for Anthony! We finally have hope!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! Vincent, your schemes have failed. Mr. Johnson won't let you off the hook!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Anthony pushing Astaroth back step by step, many of the Turner family elders, and even Dariel, couldn't suppress their excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst the crowd, Carolyn finally let out a sigh of relief. Anthony's strength was like a potent shot of adrenaline, reigniting a flicker of hope in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Silence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the crowd's excitement grew, Mordred's face darkened, and he barked, "Astaroth is merely warming up. </span><span>T</span><span>his pathetic fool </span><span>can</span><span>'</span><span>t be your</span><span> savior</span><span>!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! Astaroth could crush him effortlessly. Just wait and see..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Mordred could finish, a strange booming sound echoed from the distance.</span></p></div>
