        <h1>Chapter 98 You Shall Die</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn arrived, exuding an awe-inspiring presence that was nothing short of world-shaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, a colossal sword stood suspended in the air as if ready to cleave the heavens and the earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with devastating force, it swung towards Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason's face drained of color, and he let out a roar. Without a moment's hesitation, he retreated as fast as he could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he reigned in his tyrannical power, channeling everything into his legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, Mason unleashed a speed that was nothing short of extraordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His billowing black robe flapped noisily as he seemed to teleport dozens of feet away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before Mason could touch down, Carolyn barked, "Trying to run? Halt!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The formidable sword suddenly flipped its blade, shooting out like an arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, the sword reached over a hundred feet, catching up to Mason, who was desperately fleeing for his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thunderous crash, the sword fell from the sky, causing the earth to tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying wave of energy swept across an area of over a hundred feet. The ground split, with horrifying fissures spreading in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The immense impact kicked up an astonishing cloud of dust and sand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolf army, over a hundred feet away, couldn't dodge in time and was sent tumbling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Visible dust and debris, like a violent gust of wind, overturned the werewolf ranks and destroyed structures within its reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground cracked open with fissures several feet deep, a sight to behold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the dust settled, a massive crater, dozens of feet wide and several feet deep, appeared on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Endless cracks radiated from the crater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, in the enormous pit, there was no sign of Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's eyes widened in shock as she muttered in disbelief, "Is he dead? Turned to dust?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Jane was thinking this, a wail came from the edge of the pit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to see a figure covered in dust and grime emerging from the rubble. It was Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The immense impact had torn his extremely durable black robe to tatters, revealing his muscular body and hairy limbs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Mason crawl out, Jane was aghast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could he have survived that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far away, Carolyn was also taken aback, a look of helplessness on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't hesitate for long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Mason could fully climb out of the pit, Carolyn flicked her wrist, and the sand and debris at the edge of the pit shot into the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, a swirling tornado formed, creating a powerful gust within dozens of feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Huge marble blocks on the ground flew into the air as if they were made of foam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Distant iron fences shattered, their pieces converging towards the tempest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason was aghast. His voluminous black robe flapped wildly in the tornado's grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tornado, like a gaping maw, seemed intent on devouring all in its path as it approached Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the tornado neared, a powerful force of tearing through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This force was unstoppable, threatening to rip Mason apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason retreated desperately, but the suction of the wind was too strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed onto a railing, only for it to be uprooted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clung to a tree, only for it to be snapped in half.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying tornado annihilated everything in its path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn you. You dared to deceive me. You shall die. You shall die! I'll make you suffer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the critical moment, Mason, furious and desperate, cursed loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His vast and highly durable black robe was finally torn apart, sucked into the tornado, and instantly reduced to shreds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of the tornado was so terrifying that if it struck, Mason would undoubtedly be shredded into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, when the tornado was just thirty feet away from Mason, Carolyn suddenly convulsed and spat out a mouthful of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The unstoppable tornado instantly dissipated significantly, then continued to unravel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The immense power dissipated at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's eyes turned bloodshot as she shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She forcibly took a deep breath, and in an instant, the dissipating tornado rose into the sky once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the next second, Carolyn spat out blood again, and the tornado unraveled once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner! Don't!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Carolyn about to exert her superpowers desperately, Jane stopped her. "Mr. Johnson just said he had a way to resolve everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn was taken aback, then asked with a face full of surprise, "Really? What method does Mr. Johnson have?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have no idea."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane shook her head helplessly. "Mr. Johnson didn't finish speaking before he fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've sent people to escort Mr. Johnson and Ms. Rose Turner to a safe house. I believe that once Mr. Johnson recovers, he will definitely have a plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, all we need to do is to guard the safe house and protect Mr. Johnson and Ms. Rose Turner's safety at all costs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn took a deep breath, thought for a moment, and nodded resolutely.</span></p></div>
