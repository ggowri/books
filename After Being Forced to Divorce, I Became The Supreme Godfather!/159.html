        <h1>Chapter 158 Necros' Overwhelming Assault</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This can't be! No way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From 109 feet away, </span><span>Necros</span><span> gaped in shock, his eyes wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, Anthony was just an ordinary human. How could he possibly survive such a brutal attack?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment ago, Anthony had been kicked so hard that his body had been slammed deep into the mountain rock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he was standing, completely unharmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seizing the moment while </span><span>Necros</span><span> was still stunned, Anthony sprang into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fluid motion, he executed Blood Shadow Saber, vanishing and reappearing in the blink of an eye, now only 30 feet from </span><span>Necros</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Anthony charge at him again, </span><span>Necros</span><span> snapped out of his stupor. He let out a furious roar, and his massive hand once again came crashing down from the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony had already felt </span><span>Necros</span><span>' overwhelming power. His newly enlarged form made him not only faster but also far stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with the Dragon Avatar enhancing his strength and defense, Anthony was no longer just a mere mortal. His power was now on a whole new level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though his body might not be as massive as </span><span>Necros</span><span>', in terms of raw strength, he wasn't necessarily at a disadvantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the giant hand could land, Anthony bent his knees and sprang upward, his body soaring over 30 feet into the air to meet the descending attack head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blood Shadow Saber!" He channeled all his strength into the </span><span>Dragonfang</span><span>, and with a fierce shout, a brilliant blue light burst from the blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Necros</span><span>, seeing Anthony preparing the Blood Shadow Saber once more, sneered in both anger and contempt. "You arrogant little fool. You've learned only the basics and you dare try to challenge me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Necros</span><span> knew exactly how powerful the Blood Shadow Saber was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Anthony had mastered it completely, it wouldn't be enough to break through the defense of the Blood Shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfazed by Anthony's attack, </span><span>Necros</span><span> sped up the fall of his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The skin of his hand began to glow faintly with a sinister crimson hue, a sign that his defense was strengthening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony swung his arm, sending the blade of blue light flying toward </span><span>Necros</span><span>' palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blade crashed into the palm with a thunderous explosion, and the crimson glow on </span><span>Necros</span><span>' skin flickered, rapidly fading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with a mighty burst, the palm exploded into a cloud of blood mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Necros</span><span> roared, his hand trembling in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's something wrong with the blade!" He shouted, his fury reaching its peak as his massive foot slammed down toward Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Shadow Saber's power wasn't overwhelmingly strong, but Anthony's strike had still pierced </span><span>Necros</span><span>' defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Necros</span><span> realized that the real strength behind the attack wasn't just the Blood Shadow Saber. It was the </span><span>Dragonfang</span><span> itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony had no idea what material the </span><span>Dragonfang</span><span> was made from, but he knew its sharpness was beyond anything he'd ever imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And on top of that, this strike wasn't just fueled by the Blood Shadow Saber or the </span><span>Dragonfang</span><span> alone. It was also empowered by the immense strength of the Dragon Avatar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The result was a blow of unimaginable force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this strike only seemed to enrage </span><span>Necros</span><span> even more. His foot came down with terrifying speed, full of fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he lunged forward, his massive hands balled into fists, swinging wildly toward Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Anthony's previous attack had shattered </span><span>Necros</span><span>' palm, it barely seemed to have made a dent in </span><span>his</span><span> monstrous form. His massive hand was virtually unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a blind fury, </span><span>Necros</span><span> launched a brutal, relentless assault, punches and kicks flying faster with each passing second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each time his massive fists slammed into the ground, the earth trembled beneath him, and deep, terrifying imprints were left in the rock. The shockwaves from his attacks sent ripples through the air, making Anthony's skin crawl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground beneath his feet seemed to shake violently, as though the whole mountain was on the brink of collapsing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every blow threatened to tear him apart, leaving Anthony with no choice but to dodge for his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the power of the Dragon Avatar bolstering his defenses, there was no way Anthony could withstand this kind of force. He was strong, but not strong enough to survive </span><span>Necros</span><span>' overwhelming assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The worst part was, that his attacks were barely a nuisance to </span><span>Necros</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that giant frame, he seemed nearly indestructible. To put it simply, Anthony </span><span>might as well have been an ant trying to fight an elephant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Necros</span><span> didn't have to do anything extraordinary. His constant, unrelenting attacks were enough to slowly wear Anthony down and eventually finish him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony couldn't help but acknowledge just how terrifying the Blood Shadow was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A B-level Warrior wielding it could match the strength of a C-level, with speed, power, and defense that far surpassed a typical B-level Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only saving grace was that </span><span>Necros</span><span> seemed unable to use any martial skills after activating the Blood Shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Anthony began to form a plan, a massive slash of crimson light came hurtling down from above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The red glow radiated like coagulated blood, and the air around it crackled with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shit!" Anthony's heart skipped a beat. Without a second to think, he rolled desperately to the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enormous blade, almost ten feet long, crashed down where he'd just been standing, exploding on impact with a deafening roar.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground shattered under the shockwave, sending rocks flying and creating a powerful gust that blasted out in all directions, sending Anthony careening </span><span>backward</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught in the blast, he was hurled 32 feet away, his body slamming against the ground with brutal force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Necros</span><span> appeared from the dust, holding a blood-red machete, his footsteps shaking the very earth. The ground quaked beneath his immense power as he charged forward, his bloodthirsty grin visible even from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anthony's mind raced. Scrambling to get back on his feet, he couldn't help but ask mentally, "Devil Eye, what's his weakness?"</span></p></div>
