        <h1>Chapter 132 A Wise Man Submits to Circumstances</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne, still shy of her thirtieth birthday, had become the head of the Smith family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was confirmed that the Smiths were new money, but they were undeniably a powerful family now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made Anne the youngest leader among all the Yoland people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furthermore, it was no secret that their allegiance with the Evil Spirit Legion was entirely due to Anne's connections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless of whether these people genuinely wanted to surrender, they had no other choice at this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Smith and Blake families had joined forces, and their combined power was formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the backing of the Evil Spirit Legion, how could these people possibly maintain their foothold?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rather than sit and wait for their demise, it was better to surrender to the Evil Spirit Legion and seek a glimmer of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, all of this hinged on one crucial factor...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the Turner family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At their peak, the Turners were unstoppable. Even if the Smiths and Blakes joined forces, no one would have batted an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Turners protecting them, not even the Evil Spirit Legion would dare to challenge them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But things were different now. After the previous battle, Anne had secretly spread the word that the Turner family had only survived because they had secretly sided with the Evil Spirit Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, if even the Smith family had joined forces with them, what were they waiting for?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a particular perspective, they should even be grateful to Anne for connecting them with the Evil Spirit Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, these people now treated Anne with the utmost respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To them, Anne taking over the Smith family seemed perfectly natural.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lively chatter was abruptly cut short by the screech of tires as a convoy of vehicles screeched to a halt outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dozen black armored SUVs, gleaming and menacing, lined up in front of the Smith Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These weren't just any SUVs. They were the kind that screamed power and authority, the kind that made you instinctively take a step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is he here? Is Mr. Foster here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impressive display made everyone's hearts skip a beat, and they rushed forward to greet the arrivals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne was no exception, pushing to the front of the pack, afraid of being left behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as they rushed outside, everyone could clearly see the shield emblem on the vehicles with "Draconic Shield" written across it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they confirmed it was the Draconic Shield convoy, quite a few people cursed under their breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when one particular person stepped out of the vehicle, everyone's breath caught in their throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was well over six feet tall, built like a tank, with sharp features and blue eyes that radiated dangerous intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His entire presence gave off an aura that sent chills down people's spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What really got them was when he let out a wolf's howl from deep in his throat after stepping out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound was so deep and menacing that it made their blood run cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a Metahuman! A Beast Metahuman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this realization, many people instinctively took a step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that wasn't all. After he got out, nearly thirty other people jumped out of the remaining armored vehicles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And every single one of them was built like a linebacker, giving off an extraordinary presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this the Draconic Shield?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Must be them alright. They're something else..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, they all look like Metahumans or Warriors, don't they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gotta be. But why are they here? Don't tell me they're looking to join Mr. Foster too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd burst into whispers at the sight of Draconic Shield's imposing presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While everyone was still wondering, Anne stepped forward with a smile. "If I'm not mistaken, you must be Mr. Hastings, the head of Draconic Shield?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne strode over confidently, extending her delicate hand in greeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To everyone's surprise, the man showed no intention of shaking her hand. He merely gave a slight nod, arms crossed, and replied coolly, "Hello. I'm Aaron Hastings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such arrogance!" Aaron's attitude drew sideways glances from the crowd. Anne was left hanging awkwardly and had to withdraw her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, instead of getting angry, her eyes lit up with an unusual gleam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a competent man could afford such pride! And Aaron clearly had the qualifications!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's heart fluttered. If she could win over Aaron, he'd make a powerful ally. And when it came to conquering men, she had absolute confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, after discussing with Alvin, Anne had decided to recruit Draconic Shield to join the Evil Spirit Legion. They'd even sent people to Draconic Shield's base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Arthur didn't meet them in person but sent a message saying he would attend the family dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, this was their first encounter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her new identity, Anne never would have guessed that this burly, tough man was the same "Mr. Foster" she had knelt before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of getting angry, she winked at Aaron. "Mr. Hastings is late," she said with a charming smile. "Perhaps I should remind you that from now on, you can call me the head of the Smith family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh?" Arthur feigned surprise for a moment, then chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, it seems I'm out of the loop. My apologies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He readily accepted Anne's friendly gesture, understanding her intentions. After all, he still had his business interests in mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're too kind, Mr. Hastings," Anne replied. "It happened just ten minutes ago, so it's understandable that you wouldn't know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Congratulations, Ms. Smith.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, excuse me, I should say congratulations, Head of the Smith family..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their casual banter continued as they made their way through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne didn't waste any time with small talk. She got straight to the point. "Mr. Hastings," she began, "I've invited you here today not only for this family dinner, but also to discuss something important."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh?" Arthur replied, "Please, Ms. Smith, tell me more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As you know," Anne continued, "the majority of Yoland's elite families have chosen to align themselves with the Evil Spirit Legion. You're aware of this, yes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've heard rumors," Arthur replied vaguely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne let out a light laugh at Arthur's attempt to play coy. "Mr. Hastings," she said, her tone turning serious, "as the saying goes, 'A wise man submits to circumstances.'"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She leaned forward, her gaze intent. "As an outsider looking to establish yourself in Yoland, you need to find a strong ally. Wouldn't you agree?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And right now," she continued, "the Smith family is at the peak of its power. What's more, we have the backing of the Evil Spirit Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I, the head of the Smith family, wish to extend an invitation to you, Mr. Hastings, to join us in our allegiance to the Evil Spirit Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are your thoughts on this?" she stated frankly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne crossed her legs, her chin held high, radiating an air of confidence as if she already knew Arthur's answer.</span></p></div>
