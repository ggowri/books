        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, given the current critical situation, Jane couldn't afford to be so particular anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She held the long whip, swinging it rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Jane unleashed a combat power even stronger than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier at the West Gate, her plan was similar to Anthony's: defend and then wait for Carolyn's support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Carolyn didn't arrive for a long time, and she suspected that Carolyn was probably in trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the werewolves attacked fiercely once again. Jane knew they couldn't hold out, and the situation became increasingly dire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, she abandoned the West Gate to come to Anthony's aid, or rather, to rescue him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her original intention was to take Anthony away from the Turner Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Anthony was too badly injured and needed Rose's treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given the circumstances, her mission was to buy enough time for Rose and Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fight to the death was unavoidable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under full exertion, Jane displayed combat prowess beyond imagination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the leader of the Dragon Guild, Jane was also a legitimate Metahuman, with her strength ranking between Level A and Level B.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Jane possessed extremely rich combat experience and an innumerable array of combat skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Anthony's technique crystal originated from Jane!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps her talent didn't match Anthony's, enhanced by the Devil Eye, but she had a broad range of expertise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Jane was fiercely engaged in battle, not far away, a black whirlwind suddenly erupted!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Accompanying the whirlwind was an overwhelming aura of malevolence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Mason has made his move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was taken aback and, not daring to be careless, immediately retreated several </span><span>steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she underestimated the speed of the whirlwind. Mason almost instantly closed the distance about a hundred feet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The malevolent aura hit her in the face!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane swung her arm, and the long whip exploded with a sonic boom in the air before coming down with a fierce strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of this whip was formidable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trifles!" However, what made Jane gape in astonishment was that Mason sneered, casually flicking his black robe to completely neutralize the power of the whip!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her whip was powerful, but even though the black robe seemed as soft as a ball of cotton, it possessed an incredibly strong defensive power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was taken aback, never expecting that Mason would so easily defuse her attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Jane could come to her senses from the shock, Mason came at her like the wind, his sharp wolf claws extending from beneath the black robe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wolf claws gleamed with a sharp, cold light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane trembled, the aura of death causing an intangible fear to assault her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wolf claws slashed across her upright chest, and blood splattered!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A searing pain hit Jane as she clutched her chest and lifted her foot to force Mason back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Beauty, prepare to die!" Disregarding Jane's attack, Mason said with contempt as he kicked Jane away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he transformed into a whirlwind once again, charging forward!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Shit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black whirlwind was as swift as lightning!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason's speed left Jane with no way to avoid his attack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Beast! I, Carolyn Turner, am here to take your life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the critical moment when Jane's life was at stake, Carolyn's loud voice echoed from not far away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a surge of yellow sand surged, obscuring the sky and blocking out the sun!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the yellow sand formed a towering wall that rose from the ground, standing directly in front of Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black whirlwind slammed into the wall of sand, with countless grains of yellow sand falling onto his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a Level C Metahuman, Carolyn's elemental power was unpredictable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught off guard, Mason crashed into it, let out a moan, and then turned his head with blazing anger to look back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far away, Carolyn approached in large strides, wielding a sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was enveloped in swirling sand and wind, resembling a war goddess!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's impossible! How could you possibly escape..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing it was Carolyn, Mason was greatly shocked and instinctively took a small step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn, the spokesperson of the Turner family and a Level C Metahuman, had already instilled fear in Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Beast! Prepare to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the furious Carolyn didn't give him a chance to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She roared to summon endless sands!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her elemental power was incredibly strong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The swirling sands, filled with awe-inspiring power, swept through like a plague of locusts, crushing any enemy in their path!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst the swirling sands, a massive golden sword gradually took form, capable of tearing the sky asunder!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying might was earth-shattering, as if it were about to annihilate everything!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a Level C Metahuman? That's terrifying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Indeed, Ms. Carolyn Turner is a godlike presence; this single strike is enough to turn the tide of the battle..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The massive sword materialized out of thin air, causing a great stir at the Turner Manor. Many members of the Turner family were moved to tears of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She is the strength and soul of the Turner family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Carolyn around, all difficulties could be overcome!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the massive sword, the werewolf army trembled in fear, howling to the sky, unable to stop retreating!</span></p></div>
