        <h1>Chapter 166 A Lost Cause</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent's hatred wasn't because of Carolyn, Rose, or Anthony. There was something deeper than that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn wasn't running her mouth to change Vincent's mind. Yeah, that'd be nice, but she was </span><span>actually </span><span>buying time to reach Dariel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent smirked. "Don't bother wasting your efforts, Carolyn." Seeing her fall silent, he shook his head with a mocking smile. "I've already taken precautions around here, as well as on your car. There's no way you can contact anyone outside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn froze for a moment before asking, "So, you've been planning this for a while?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent sneered, waving dismissively. "Come on now." He gestured toward the nearby Turner family's personal guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them exchanged glances before walking straight toward Vincent without even looking back at Carolyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Traitors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn wasn't surprised by this and sighed in resignation, "Looks like you're not planning to back down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent didn't hesitate to nod. "Exactly. There's only one thing I have to say today. Will you submit, or will you be crushed? Let me be clear&mdash;you won't get away this time. Be smart about it. I really don't want to kill you, you know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn gave a bitter laugh. "Submit? Submit to you? Or to the Evil Spirit Legion?" Her gaze turned razor-sharp as she uttered the name "Evil Spirit Legion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent didn't deny it and admitted, "Yes. Submit to the Evil Spirit Legion. I'll be honest with you&mdash;I joined them a long time ago. Because I knew it was my only way </span><span>out, my only chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Carolyn saw him nod, the anger on her face softened slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She realized he was a lost cause and sighed once again, "I see." Suddenly, she raised her voice, shouting, "You filthy Evil Spirit Legion cowards! Stop hiding and show yourselves. I, the head of this family, am right here! If you've got the guts, come out and face me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice roared like thunder, shaking the entire valley. The echo rippled through the air, vast and overwhelming. At the same time, the ground beneath her feet stirred, kicking up a swirling cloud of dust that rippled outward like waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next </span><span>second</span><span>, the dust abruptly transformed into a massive yellow sword that shot into the sky. The blade sliced through the air, covering over 300 feet in seconds, before slamming into a massive boulder halfway up the mountainside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deafening crash and boom, followed by a sharp crackling sound, the giant boulder shattered into countless fragments. The rubble tumbled down the cliff in a roaring cascade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But most importantly, as the debris fell, a hulking figure leaped down from the top of the boulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shadow moved incredibly fast, as nimble as a wildcat. It darted down the nearly vertical cliffside as if it were flat ground. On closer inspection, a white sash was tied around the figure's waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pristine sash stood out sharply against the black clothing and the night sky, creating a striking contrast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom&mdash;the figure landed heavily on the asphalt road below, creating a deep crater beneath its feet. It was none other than Malakar, one of the Four Demon Lords.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After landing, Malakar grinned at Carolyn. "As expected of the head of the Turner family. You're truly extraordinary." But that strange smile of his sent a chill down the spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a physique surpassing six and a half feet, he was tall, solidly built, and brimming with muscle, as if he might explode with strength at any moment. It was obvious he was a Level B Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn paused for a moment, her gaze sweeping over him. At first glance, aside from his sheer size, he didn't seem all that special. But she figured there had to be more to him&mdash;Vincent seemed so confident, and Malakar himself carried an air of certainty. There was no doubt Malakar wasn't just some nobody.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, she spoke up, "You don't look like an ordinary thug. Care to tell me your name?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malakar answered without hesitation, "Malakar."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn frowned slightly and replied, "You alone might not be enough to take me down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malakar shrugged it off. "We won't know until we fight, will we?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, really?" Carolyn's frown deepened. Her thoughts raced, but she pressed on. "The Evil Spirit Legion went to a lot of trouble to come after the Turner family. I doubt it's just because of Vincent. What's your real goal? What does my family have that's worth all this effort?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This question had been gnawing at Carolyn for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before Malakar could answer, Vincent interrupted impatiently, "Stop wasting time with her, Lord Malakar. She's stalling. Kill her and capture Rose alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it." Malakar nodded calmly. He raised a hand, and with a simple motion, summoned a gleaming, snow-white longsword out of thin air. The sword was over three feet long, and its sharp, icy glow was dazzling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gripping the white sword, he said, "You only get one chance, Mrs. Carolyn Turner. </span><span>Archlord</span><span> </span><span>Iscairn</span><span> instructed me to give you an offer. If you're willing to&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Malakar could finish speaking, a sudden whooshing sound came from behind. In an instant, he froze. His voice cut off as he spun around, slashing the longsword in a swift arc behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clang&mdash;the white sword struck a blade made of condensed yellow sand. The sand blade shattered midair, scattering into a useless mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph. Impressive trick," Malakar sneered, his face darkening. He then let out a thunderous roar. "Since you're so eager to die, I'll&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he assumed the sand had dispersed, it reformed, swirling into over a dozen smaller swords. Each one darted toward him like streaks of</span><span> </span><span>lightning</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>W</span><span>hoosh&mdash;whoosh&mdash;whoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sudden shift caught even Malakar off guard. He hadn't seen it coming.</span></p></div>
