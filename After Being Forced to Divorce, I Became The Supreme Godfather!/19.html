        <h1>Chapter 19 Boundless Love</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you?" Alvin asked ingratiatingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman in red answered calmly, "My name is Helen White, and I am the maid of Ms. Rose Turner, the eldest daughter of the Turner family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone had heard about Rose Turner!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words caused a stir among the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Ms. Turner here? She's the only diamond member of the Dragon Guild!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Turner family is Yoland's only old-line family, unmatched in its influence. Ms. Turner, as their heir, is the most prestigious figure in Yoland!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner isn't just brilliant; she's breathtakingly beautiful. She's like a goddess!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I could see Ms. Turner just once, my trip would be worthwhile!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. White, did you say Ms. Turner is issuing a mission?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent as all eyes turned to Helen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen nodded. "I have a painting here. Whoever can decipher it will earn the opportunity to serve Ms. Turner for three days. The reward is thirty million dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To serve the eldest daughter of the Turner family was a dream opportunity for many.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It meant a chance to be close to Rose, to witness her elegance firsthand, and perhaps even earn her favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That favor could lead to access to the Turner family's resources and connections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even an ordinary person, backed by the Turner family's support, could quickly become one of Yoland's elite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not to mention, after three days of service, there was a bonus of thirty million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The offer was irresistible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Anthony found himself tempted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others were utterly enthralled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. White, please show us the painting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never imagined Ms. Turner was also an artist! Her work must be extraordinary!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd eagerly awaited a glimpse of Rose's creation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen walked to the wall, carefully unwrapped a cloth-covered painting, and hung it up before pulling away the covering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every eye widened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead of marveling at an intricate masterpiece, the crowd froze in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The painting wasn't what they had imagined. On the canvas, rough black lines crisscrossed aimlessly on a plain white background. It looked like a child's random scribbles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone thought, "What kind of painting is this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could it resemble a child's doodle?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is this truly the work of the goddess-like Ms. Turner?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner has said she will come in person in one hour to hear the answers. Whoever solves the painting may leave with her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good luck to you all," Helen added, then turned and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd exchanged puzzled looks. In the awkward silence, Alvin suddenly clapped his hands and exclaimed, "As expected of Ms. Turner! She is unconventional. She is... painting with her soul!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne chimed in enthusiastically, "Ms. Turner's art must carry profound meaning. We must reflect deeply!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely! Ms. Turner must be conveying an extraordinary message through this piece!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quiet, everyone! Focus and contemplate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd grew solemn, their eyes glued to the lines on the canvas as if hunting for hidden treasures within Rose's work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing at the back, Anthony frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Painting with her soul? What nonsense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone with eyes could see this was nothing more than a random mess. It wasn't even a proper painting, just scribbles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "What is this goddess-like Ms. Turner trying to do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is she playing everyone for fools?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That doesn't seem right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling perplexed, Anthony instinctively activated his Devil Eye. A voice echoed in </span><span>his mind, "Devil Eye activated. Analysis initiated."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Devil Eye unraveled the painting's mystery, Anthony's excitement surged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "So that is it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally understood the message hidden in the painting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And with thirty million dollars on the line, Anthony couldn't help but clench his fist in triumph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hour passed quickly, and all eyes turned to the hall's entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen appeared, escorting a slender woman dressed in purple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman wore a veil, concealing her face. Yet her graceful figure and striking presence were enough to leave everyone spellbound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the charm of Rose Turner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Rose arrived, Helen's beauty alone had captivated the room. But the moment Rose entered, even with her face hidden, Helen was instantly overshadowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Greetings, Ms. Turner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nice to see you, Ms. Turner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An honor to meet you, Ms. Turner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd eagerly greeted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose responded with a gentle nod, acknowledging their enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin, barely containing his excitement, stepped forward. "Ms. Turner, I have some unique insights into your painting..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait," Helen interrupted icily, cutting him off. She gestured toward two Dragon Guards standing nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards immediately carried over a chair, placing it respectfully behind Rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Rose, as the Dragon Guild's diamond member, had the privilege of being attended to by Dragon Guards in this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose seated herself gracefully. Her voice, melodious and calm, broke the tension. "The rules of the Dragon Guild state that each member may only bring one companion. I have brought Helen, but my family is concerned for my safety and wishes for another person to accompany me. That's why I issued this Mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoever deciphers my painting will earn the role.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, let's begin. I'm listening."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go first!" Alvin shouted, terrified someone might seize the chance before him. "In my interpretation, Ms. Turner's painting embodies boundless love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Each seemingly random line represents a profound understanding of the curves of life. These interwoven lines symbolize the interconnectedness of all living beings. They remind us that we are a shared community of destiny, meant to support and cherish one another!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This painting is a testament to Ms. Turner's infinite love and compassion for the world!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Life curves were woven into a shared destiny. Alvin's explanation was brilliant. It perfectly captured the boundless love of Rose, the noble heiress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd, feeling inferior, assumed Alvin had already won Rose's favor. They even felt the Blake family would grow stronger again under his lead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people began to congratulate Alvin.</span></p></div>
