        <h1>Chapter 125 Keep Dreaming!</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony dedicated himself fully to training, using every moment to sharpen his skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't just focus on Energy-Absorbing Breathing but also on refining his martial arts and marksmanship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Martial arts were the foundation of a Warrior, and Anthony knew he had too many weaknesses in his fight with Arthur. Without Devil Eye, he wouldn't have lasted nearly as long. Even with it, he had still been no match for Arthur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marksmanship was another priority. With Devil Eye's enhancement, his accuracy was flawless&mdash;every shot perfect. But he was too reliant on Devil Eye, and its effects were temporary. He couldn't afford to depend on it every time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's training pushed him beyond his limits. He practiced hitting moving targets, increasing his firing speed and reaction time, using Devil Eye to amplify his natural abilities. The stronger he became, the more powerful Devil Eye would be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For three days, Anthony immersed himself in this grueling regimen, cutting himself off from the outside world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the third day, Anne called.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony!" she snarled the moment he answered. "You coward! Finally decided to pick up your phone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, unfazed, replied coldly, "Say what you need to say. We're divorced, Anne. Stop harassing me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's voice exploded through the line. "Harassing you? Don't flatter yourself, you useless bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony calmly pulled the phone away from his ear, waiting for her rant to subside. When she finally paused for breath, he spoke evenly. "What else would you call a random phone call from an ex-wife who has no business contacting her ex-husband?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You&mdash;" Anne stammered, practically shrieking. "Shut up! Listen to me, you piece of trash. I'm doing you a favor by warning you. The Smith family gathering is in three days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've issued an open invitation, personally welcoming Mr. Foster. You'd better find a way to grovel before him, or you'll regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice turned icy. "And don't even think about leaving Yoland. You're trapped. In three days, you'll show up whether you like it or not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony chuckled. "Oh, I'll be there. And in three days, you'll be on your knees, begging me to take you back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Disgusting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's fury boiled over. "You're delusional! Do you think I'd fall for your pathetic tricks again? If you don't kneel before Mr. Foster and pledge your loyalty, I'll make sure you regret ever being born!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony didn't bother responding. He ended the call mid-rant, a slight grin on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After everything he'd been through, Anne's tantrums were little more than an annoyance. He stretched lazily, shoved his hands into his pockets, and stepped out of the training room. Three days of relentless practice had prepared him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was time to return to the Turner family&mdash;and to Rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he exited, Seraph intercepted him. "Mr. Johnson, the Smith family is making their move."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony raised an eyebrow. "Oh? Go on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anne has joined forces with the Blakes, the Clementines, the Montgomerys, and a few other elite families in Yoland. They've issued a formal announcement pledging allegiance to the Evil Spirit Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're planning to donate their entire fortunes to the Legion, claiming they're honoring Mr. Foster's reign over Yoland for generations to come."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony laughed mockingly. "Desperate fools. They'll only learn their lesson once they've been buried six feet under."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The move was clear. Anne and her allies were panicking, eager to prove their worth to the Evil Spirit Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was unheard of for elite families to openly declare allegiance to the Legion. Normally, they avoided any association with them, let alone a public alliance. The Legion's reputation was enough to strike fear into anyone's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hilarious," Seraph said with a smirk. "Though, if we're being honest, we can blame your little Rose for this. She ordered every major family in Yoland to cut ties with the Smiths. What other options did they have but to take drastic measures?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Backed into a corner, they're throwing everything they have at the Legion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a pause, she added, "Oh, and there's a rumor going around Yoland that the Turner family has secretly pledged allegiance to the Evil Spirit Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're saying that's the real reason Mason spared you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph's gaze sharpened, searching Anthony's expression as she teased, "You've become quite the celebrity in Yoland, Mr. Johnson. First the Smith family, then the Turners. Everyone's calling you the ultimate gold digger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony laughed lightly, completely unbothered. "They have quite the imagination."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph shrugged. "That's not all. The Zodiac has been stirring up trouble too..."</span></p></div>
