        <h1>Chapter 84 The Ignorant</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't believe him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Anne finished speaking, Alvin, who was eager to show his loyalty, immediately cursed, "You damned bastard, how could you still brag here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What can you guarantee for something that relies on drugs to boost your power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're useless! You have nothing! Even at this time, you're still trying to pretend to be strong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you still believe in the Turner family? Carolyn has died somewhere, and what can the Turner family use to protect you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By Anthony? A bastard?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think he has the ability to fight against Mr. Foster? He is simply overestimating his own abilities!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony's life is worthless, and his death is not a pity. Besides, he has no way out, but you are different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Swear allegiance to the Mr. Foster, and he will definitely not treat you unfairly. What are you still hesitating about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason seemed impatient and waved his hand, saying, "There's no point in talking anymore! Those who obey will prosper; those who disobey will perish!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, get ready!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than 100 werewolves roared in unison, deafening, and the earth trembled!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Foster, please spare my life, and I know I was wrong..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I swear to be loyal to you, Mr. Foster, and the Evil Spirit Legion..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please spare my life. I am willing to follow you, Mr. Foster. I hope you will show mercy..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The howling of werewolves was deafening, and the few remaining people were so frightened that their legs went weak, and they fell to their knees on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn Anthony!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are such a bastard, and you deserve to die, but you dare to deceive people with lies and try to drag us down with you. You deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! Damn it! Mr. Foster is here, and why don't you kneel down and accept your death..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kneel down! Kneel down before Mr. Foster and apologize for your crimes..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if to show their loyalty, after kneeling down, the group could not wait to turn around and angrily scold Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed at which they turned against each other was truly shocking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was stunned and burst out laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were a bunch of ignorant people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it was not their fault. The werewolves came with great force, crushing the Turner family in almost all aspects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The army of Evil Spirit Legion was already terrifying, and with the addition of the werewolves, they gathered outside the door and howled to the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who wouldn't be afraid?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, to them, Anthony was just a stranger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason why they were hesitant before was not because of Anthony but because of the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the Turner family was surrounded by enemies and was in danger. They dared not gamble their lives on this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that everyone was kneeling down in surrender, Anne snorted indifferently, "You guys know what's best for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she turned to look at Anthony and said in a deep voice, "Anthony, you useless bastard, why don't you kneel down quickly?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you are willing to kneel down and beg for mercy, Mr. Foster may be able to spare your life and keep you by his side as a dog!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A dog?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his eyebrows, stared at Anne, and asked, "Are you saying that we should trample on the dignity and kneel down to lick the werewolves like you guys?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne was furious and shouted angrily, "You! Anthony, you are so bold! You are about to die, and you still dare to speak without thinking!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are a piece of trash, and how could you be worthy of dignity?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Submitting to Mr. Foster is not a violation of dignity but a supreme honor. Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was clearly kneeling, but Anne tried her best to straighten her upper body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, she put on an expression of great pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did they know that this posture looked like a pug with its upper body standing upright, which was really funny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne was like a clown!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony no longer argued with her but looked at Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coincidentally, Mason also looked over and said indifferently, "As a test subject, you dare to pretend to be a hero and destroy my plan, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony raised his head and said, "The Evil Spirit Legion is extremely evil and anyone can punish them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason snorted indifferently and said disdainfully, "Just you? A novice test subject who relies on drugs?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it seems that you have quite good talent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about this? I will show some mercy and give you a chance to redeem yourself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Capture Rose and hand her over to me, then kneel down and swear to submit to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can forgive you for what happened before and spare your life. How about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Level B metahuman had significant strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of what happened before, Mason mistakenly thought that Anthony was some </span><span>powerful metahuman with superpowers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why he mobilized so many troops and spared no expense to besiege the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Anthony was just a test subject, so Mason was actually much more relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his words made Anthony think about something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he guessed correctly, their target had been Rose from the beginning to the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was the previous ambush or this siege of the Turner family, it was all for Rose, not him, Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, if this was the case, it seemed that the Evil Spirit Legion did all this not just because of Vincent, and there must be some unspeakable secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you still standing there for?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Foster has shown mercy, and why don't you quickly catch Rose and kneel down to thank him?" Anthony was silent in deep thought, so Anne angrily shouted.</span></p></div>
