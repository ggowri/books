        <h1>Chapter 29 Seeing Through the Distance</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only Rose could bring herself to believe that the Eldergleam Fungus in Anthony's hands was real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how hard she tried, the truth was glaringly obvious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even she, a budding genius in medicine, could see it. Heck, even Helen, with her limited knowledge, could tell at a glance that the Eldergleam Fungus was a fake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart ached, shattering into a thousand pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you really prove that this one is genuine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clung to a sliver of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was her ultimate question, the last thread of a fantasy she clung to before reality might cruelly snatch it away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony looked into her tear-filled eyes and felt a punch to the gut. For the first time, he truly understood his place in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was both flustered and touched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gently, he took her hand. "How could I ever lie to you?" he said softly. "You're smart. You can figure this out. Just think about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are two items here. If one's a fake, then the other one's gotta be the real deal, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"B is pieced together. It's a fake. Didn't you notice it at first glance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose felt a warmth spread through her cold heart as Anthony held her hand. Her eyes searched his face. "What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony smiled, "Since B is fake, that means A is the true thousand-year-old Eldergleam Fungus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose frowned. "But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony cut her off gently. "The reason A looks fake at first glance is because someone tampered with it. Now I understand the wisdom of the Smith family's ancestor. He tried to protect the Eldergleam Fungus, but his cleverness backfired. Over time, his descendants got confused and mistook the fake for the real thing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's face twisted with rage. "Anthony, what nonsense are you spouting? Do you think I don't know which one is real?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin sneered, his voice dripping with contempt, "Anthony, you're just a disgraced loser. Stop trying to sweet-talk Ms. Turner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The facts are clear. What else is there to argue about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose, lost in contemplation, suddenly said, "Are you suggesting that the Smith family ancestor might have tampered with the real Eldergleam Fungus to throw off potential thieves?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony nodded vigorously. "Exactly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The thousand-year-old Eldergleam Fungus is incredibly rare. To prevent theft and protect its spiritual energy, the ancestor of the Smith family sealed the real Eldergleam Fungus with a special material.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It looks like a cheap plastic imitation, devoid of any spiritual aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But inside that seal is the true thousand-year-old Eldergleam Fungus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Understanding dawned on Rose, and she gasped, her eyes widening. "I see!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The ancestor of the Smith family sealed away the authentic Eldergleam Fungus, and </span><span>what they did was craft a decoy by piecing together several fungi that were centuries old. As time passed, even their own descendants got confused, ending up believing the counterfeit was the genuine article."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony let out a smile, "This is exactly what happens when the genuine article gets lost in the mix. The ancestor of the Smith family probably never dreamed his own lineage would end up this clueless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Anne, his lips curling into a sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's face turned green with shame, even more so than when she had knelt naked before Anthony the previous night. Fury and humiliation burned in her eyes. "Anthony, your sweet words won't save you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're so sure, then peel it open and show everyone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony turned to Rose. "Ms. Turner, I already gave you this Eldergleam Fungus. I was going to let you verify it yourself later. But do you want to peel it now? In front of everyone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose's eyes sparkled with determination. "Yes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's peel it open and clear your name once and for all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes, stunning and full of life, still shimmered with the remnants of tears, like dewdrops glistening under the morning sun, adding to her charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! I'll do it for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony drew Dragonfang, his blade, and with a decisive motion, sliced through the Eldergleam Fungus he held in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room held its breath as all eyes locked onto his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Anthony was right, Anne and Alvin would be publicly humiliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he was wrong, it would be his reputation and possibly his life on the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Anthony's explanation made logical sense, no one truly believed him. It all sounded too far-fetched, too fantastical to be real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dragonfang, known for its razor-sharp edge, effortlessly pierced the outer layer of the Eldergleam Fungus. Anthony, wary of harming the true fungus within, proceeded with utmost caution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He traced a careful circle along the surface and then gently pried it open, much like one would crack open a crab's shell. As the tough exterior gave way, it unveiled something breathtaking within: a radiant, glowing Eldergleam Fungus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gasps echoed through the auction hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sweet, invigorating aroma of an ancient elixir filled the air, refreshing everyone's senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if the very air had come alive, tingling with vitality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were spellbound, caught in the magic of the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd swayed, drunk on the fragrance, as if they'd just sipped the finest wine. For a moment, no one could speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The massive auction hall, once buzzing with tension and doubt, now fell into an eerie silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, Jane broke the quiet. She stood up from her platform and began to clap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gazed at Anthony with eyes full of warmth and admiration. "Congratulations, Mr. Johnson, on successfully acquiring the thousand-year-old Eldergleam Fungus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spotting treasures from afar. Mr. Johnson, your knack for identifying spiritual medicines is genuinely exceptional!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if the entire room had woken from a dream. They gaped at Anthony in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, they encountered a vision so breathtaking that each of them gasped, holding their breath in sheer amazement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose, usually the picture of purity, shyness, and restraint, stood on her tiptoes, her heart full to bursting. In front of everyone, she gently kissed Anthony on the forehead.</span></p></div>
