        <h1>Chapter 40 Core Secrets</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Johnson, there's trouble!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The gravity of the situation has surpassed anything I could have imagined!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph approached. Her usually calm demeanor was now clouded with an unsettling gravity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony had never seen Seraph so utterly serious and hastily inquired, "What is it? Did the Evil Spirit Legion send a stronger assassin after Rose?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart plummeted at the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't the thought of losing a valuable ally, someone who could restore his energy in an instant, nor was it the failure of the mission that weighed on him. It was the fear of losing his beloved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph's eyes widened in surprise. "Why would you think that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rose is the esteemed daughter of the Turner family, their chosen successor. If the Evil Spirit Legion failed to kill her once, it'll be hard for them to succeed now. She's under heavy protection at Turner Manor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony exhaled in relief and patted his chest. "Thank goodness! That's a relief."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Seraph's cold laugh cut through the moment like a blade. "Don't be so quick to relax. Rose may be safe, but now, you should worry about yourself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know how the Turner family reached their conclusion, but after a day and a night of deliberation, they've declared you the murderer. They've made it public."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's blood ran cold. "What do you mean? That's impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph replied, "It's true. The Turner family has placed a bounty on your head: one billion dollars to whoever captures you. And that's not all. They're offering a magical elixir, one that can even raise the dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The entire city is in an uproar. Everyone's hunting you. If this castle weren't a relic left by Godfather, with its mysteries and protections, you'd have been dragged out by the mob already."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's face drained of color. His mind reeled, struggling to comprehend the sheer injustice of it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "I saved Rose. I was her savior. How was I suddenly the villain?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose could clear my name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why hadn't she?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could she have betrayed me, too?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I accepted her invitation. I had to attend the banquet at Turner Manor tomorrow. How could I possibly go now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His thoughts spiraled into chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the second thing you wanted to tell me?" Anthony asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph's expression grew somber. "Investigating the Evil Spirit Legion is no easy task. I lack the resources to get answers quickly, but I believe you should seek out Dragon Guild. There's a woman there who may help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dragon Guild?" Understanding dawned on Anthony. "You mean Jane Ronald?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph's lips curled into a cold sneer, "As the director of the branch of Dragon Guild in Yoland, if she can't assist you with this, then you have every right to take her head on the spot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She wouldn't dare resist."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony thought, "Take her head?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gazing at her furious visage, he felt a shiver of curiosity mixed with concern. "Is it really that bad? I mean, do you have some kind of vendetta against Jane or something?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph ground her teeth. "I have no personal grudge against her. But be careful. When you go there, don't get devoured by that vixen!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Seraph turned on her heel and slammed the door behind her, leaving Anthony in stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was thick with the palpable scent of jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the image of Jane's captivating beauty and her mesmerizing eyes floated into his mind, he suddenly felt like he was trapped in a den between two fierce tigresses, each one more formidable than the last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was no other option. To uncover the truth, he'd have to seek out Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After some hasty disguise preparations, Anthony slipped into the cover of night as he made his way toward Dragon Guild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if they had anticipated his arrival, the grand double doors, which usually only opened on trading days, stood slightly ajar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Johnson, Ms. Ronald is expecting you. Please, follow me," a guard said with a deep bow, his voice laced with uncommon respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony followed the guard through the winding paths of the villa. He arrived once </span><span>more at the luxurious residence of Jane. The doors stood closed, and the familiar, delicate fragrance of her chambers lingered in the air; yet, she was nowhere to be seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He coughed lightly to announce his presence. "Ms. Ronald, are you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unsure of what to do, Anthony ventured further inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he passed by a decorative screen, the soft sound of trickling water reached his ears. Curiosity getting the better of him, he glanced to his side and froze. Through the transparent glass door of the adjacent bathroom, the reflection of a woman's form danced in the flickering light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was bathing, her hands gliding over her skin like silk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Johnson, please wait a moment. I'll be with you shortly after I finish washing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her sultry voice drifted through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was aroused, and he quickly turned away, his heart hammering in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few moments later, the soft patter of footsteps approached from behind. Jane emerged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her damp hair cascaded over her shoulders, and her bare feet sank into the plush carpet. The red silk nightgown she wore clung to her wet skin, accentuating every curve of her figure with a tantalizing clarity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her toes, painted a vibrant red, peeked out from beneath the hem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her legs, rounded and plump, glistened under the dim light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her chest, adorned with two tender peaks reminiscent of ripe cherries, beckoned with an inviting allure, tempting anyone near to explore their exquisite beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Johnson," she purred, lowering her body seductively before him, "what is it you're looking at?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony swallowed hard, tearing his eyes away from her. "Ms. Ronald, I came to ask you something."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"About the mutant werewolves and the Evil Spirit Legion that attacked Rose?" Jane said smoothly, her voice like honeyed silk. She moved like a cat, her lithe form settling onto his lap with ease. "But before we get to that, tell me, who are you really?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know you as Mr. Johnson, a core member of the Godfather's circle. But just how core are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony frowned. "Is that really important?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very much so," Jane replied, her tone suddenly sharp and piercing. "The information I hold is highly confidential. I can only share it with someone who is truly qualified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to be sure you're up to the task. Are you really worth me risking an information leak? What do you think, Mr. Johnson?"</span></p></div>
