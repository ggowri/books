        <h1>Chapter 184 No Way Out</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sea of black-clad figures wasn't just made up of family enforcers. A significant portion belonged to the Evil Spirit Legion, and there were plenty of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A collective gasp rippled through the crowd as Anne finished speaking. Many who had been backing away froze in their tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These people feared the Evil Spirit Legion far more than they feared Anthony. After all, the Legion's reputation for cold-blooded killing was legendary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of them still thought of Anthony as nothing more than a failure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attack!" Anne commanded. "Kill Anthony!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her threats were working, she pressed her advantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone </span><span>from</span><span> the </span><span>Legion</span><span> </span><span>quickly picked up on her cue, raising his blade. "Move in, </span><span>or you're dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take Anthony down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd stirred restlessly, but their hesitation didn't last long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, they all chose to turn against Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the gathering mob, Anthony knew there was no avoiding bloodshed now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sharp ring, he raised </span><span>Dragonfang</span><span> once more, ready to meet their charge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time would be different&mdash;he wouldn't hold back. Each strike of his blade would be lethal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood stained the ground as Anthony cut through his enemies like the Death himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His rampage left everyone stunned&mdash;Anne, the Evil Spirit Legion, all of them watched in horror as he tore through their ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could stand in Anthony's path. The crowd kept retreating as he pressed forward, leaving a trail of bodies in his wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was nearly at the valley's exit, seemingly unstoppable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne stood at a distance, trembling uncontrollably. She'd known Anthony was strong and had seen it firsthand, but watching him now sent chills down her spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Anne was terrified, a contemptuous voice boomed across the valley. "Well, well. You've got some nerve, coming here to play hero."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne whirled around to see a towering figure in black approaching, his face dark with murderous intent. Her expression instantly shifted from fear to joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lord Mordred!" she shouted triumphantly. "You're back! Anthony, your time's up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony felt his heart skip a beat at that name. Thanks to Arthur's intel, he knew exactly who Mordred was&mdash;one of the Four Demon Lords.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony swung his blade in a wide arc, forcing back more than a dozen black-clad attackers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men who had been desperately trying to surround him suddenly noticed Mordred's arrival, and their tactics instantly changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Mordred on the scene, they no longer needed to put their neck on the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony wasn't </span><span>naive</span><span>. Even with the pressure easing off, charging forward wasn't an option anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The valley had only one exit, and Mordred was blocking it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a split-second decision, Anthony's mind raced through his options. There was only one choice&mdash;escape over the mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Arthur was right about Mordred's power, this opponent wasn't just equal to </span><span>Necros</span><span>&mdash;he might be even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's last encounter with </span><span>Necros</span><span> had pushed him to his absolute limits, and he'd barely escaped with his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Mordred truly outclassed </span><span>Necros</span><span>, Anthony stood no chance, especially while trying to protect both Carolyn and Rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A direct confrontation would be suicide. Running was the only option.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry about this, Aunt Carolyn!" Anthony called out as he made his move. Without hesitation, he wrapped his arms around both Rose and Carolyn, one on each side, and sprinted toward the mountain wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cliff </span><span>face</span><span> loomed before them, rising at an almost perfect ninety-degree angle, its surface unnervingly smooth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's one stroke of luck was the thick tangle of vines covering the cliff face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He launched himself skyward, reaching an impossible height, and just as gravity began to take hold, he stomped down hard on one of the thicker vines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using it like a springboard, he shot even higher instead of falling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?</span><span>!</span><span>" Anne's face drained of color when she saw Anthony making his escape. "Stop him!" she screamed. "Don't let him get away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how could they? Most of their forces were just regular people, except for a handful of Warriors and Metahumans from the Evil Spirit Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was practically flying across the cliffs. There was no way they could catch him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as everyone was starting to lose hope, a red streak of light shot through the air like crimson lightning, heading straight for the distant cliff face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The light turned out to be a red spear, which buried itself deep into the rock wall with terrifying force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spearhead had sunk almost completely into the cliff, showing just how much power was behind that throw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact sent massive cracks splintering through the cliff face, unleashing an unnatural windstorm in its wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony found himself mere feet away from the deadly spear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The violent gust slammed into him, carrying razor-sharp rock shards that packed a supernatural punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Worse still, the spear's blast had destroyed all the vines within several yards, leaving Anthony with nothing to grab onto.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the spear continued its violent vibration, Anthony and the two women plummeted toward the ground below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard!" came a roar from the distance. It was Mordred, transformed into a streak of light as he charged toward them. "Today's the day you die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Standing over seven feet tall, Mordred's footsteps thundered against the ground as he ran. A terrifying aura of bloodlust radiated from his massive frame, sending chills down the spines of everyone present.</span></p></div>
