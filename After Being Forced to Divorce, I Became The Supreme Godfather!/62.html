        <h1>Chapter 61 Hypocritical Virtue</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calvin, as the acting head of the family, I now order you, remove the finger cap!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's voice was sharp and commanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin's face turned ashen as though struck by lightning. Gritting his teeth, he protested, "Ms. Carolyn Turner, I refuse! Why would you believe Anthony's words and humiliate those of us who have loyally served the Turner family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your actions will dishearten everyone here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd watched with bated breath. The silence was heavy, yet their unspoken defiance rang deafeningly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was no longer about Anthony. It was about Carolyn siding with an outsider to humiliate the family's loyal servants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Carolyn failed to provide a satisfactory explanation, the morale of the Turner family staff would shatter. Their loyalty might never recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Carolyn stood firm, unwilling to yield even an inch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fixing her gaze on Calvin, she said coldly, "Enough! Follow the order and take off the finger cap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The more you resist, the guiltier you seem!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she stepped toward Calvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, the air around them began to stir. Dust rose from the ground, forming a swirling yellow net in midair, its oppressive weight bearing down like a thundercloud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony had already witnessed Carolyn's strength firsthand and still felt lingering unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He whispered to Rose, "What kind of Metahuman is Ms. Carolyn Turner?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose, her tone full of admiration, replied, "Aunt Carolyn is an Earth-element Metahuman. She's probably at level-C now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony thought, "No wonder she's so powerful. It turns out she is a level-C Metahuman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the Metahumans Anthony had encountered, the earliest were Alvin's Shadow Sentinel and Black Cloak, both barely reaching level-A.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mutant werewolf was also level-A.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel was in the upper range of level-A.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Seraph and Jane, Anthony couldn't yet determine their exact level but suspected they were high level-A.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even together, none of them could contend with Carolyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A level-C elemental Metahuman in this small Yoland was undoubtedly an existence that could crush everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Carolyn Turner, you can't do this! Unless you give me a solid reason, I will die </span><span>with resentment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin backed away but soon found himself trapped. The air around him had hardened like walls of yellow cement, rendering him immobile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face contorted with pain as he continued to shout, "I refuse to comply!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I demand to see Sir Turner!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've served the family faithfully for thirty years. Why are you treating me like this? Ms. Carolyn Turner, your actions will alienate the people!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Vincent knelt on one knee, his voice ringing out, "Please reconsider, Aunt Carolyn!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no concrete evidence, just Anthony's word as an outsider. How can that convince everyone?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I suspect Anthony is abusing his power for personal revenge, deliberately targeting Calvin!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn hesitated momentarily, considering their protests, then declared loudly, "Anthony, explain yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony stepped forward, raising his voice to address the crowd. "Everyone, according to the werewolf assassin's confession, their contact had only four fingers on their left hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I called this assembly to conduct a routine inspection and clear all your names!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calvin's refusal to remove the finger cap raises suspicions. Both Ms. Carolyn Turner and I have every reason to suspect he is the mastermind!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, everyone suddenly understood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, many still couldn't grasp why Calvin would hire a werewolf to assassinate Rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen suddenly pointed at Calvin, her voice trembling with anger. "I know why! As the steward, Calvin has always defied Ms. Turner's authority. On several occasions, he embezzled funds and accepted bribes, only to be caught by Ms. Turner. Out of kindness, she spared him public disgrace and merely warned him privately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But instead of gratitude, he bore a grudge. Fearing that Ms. Turner's ascension to the family head would leave him no place in the Turner family, he plotted to eliminate her right before her birthday banquet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calvin, you're despicable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The revelation was shocking but made sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Rose's personal maid, Helen's character was trusted by everyone. Sometimes, her words could even represent Rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen never lied. It turned out that Calvin, who appeared to be honest on the surface, was actually two-faced, involved in corruption and bribery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some servants who had been extorted for money by Calvin, seeing that his downfall was imminent, finally gathered the courage to speak out loudly, "I can prove it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once, I was late for work, and Calvin threatened to fire me unless I gave him half a month's wages!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He forced me to work while sick, threatening to dock my entire paycheck if I didn't!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's a hypocrite! Skimming wages and embezzling funds. I can vouch for that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted into a torrent of condemnations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn shouted, "Do you still deny it? You know my methods. Don't make me resort to force!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin, cornered and humiliated, finally removed the golden finger cap from his left hand. Beneath it, his pinky was indeed missing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sinister grin spread across his face. "Yes, I only have four fingers. But so what? "Ms. Carolyn Turner, is Anthony's word enough to convict me of being the mastermind?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unless you bring the assassin here to confront me face-to-face, I'll never confess!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you kill me now, it will be a grave mistake, a betrayal of a loyal servant of the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Turner ancestors, as well as future generations, will never forgive you! You'll forever be branded in shame!"</span></p></div>
