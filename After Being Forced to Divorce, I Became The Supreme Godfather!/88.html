        <h1>Chapter 87 A Fatal Blow</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After several rounds of seesaw battle, Anthony was still the one dominating the chance of victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this was just a ruse. His true intention was to kill him with one strike out of Mason's surprise!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holding the Dragonfang, Anthony waits for the right moment to stab Mason's throat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this strike, Anthony had a ninety percent chance of taking Mason by surprise and severely injuring him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he succeeded in severely injuring Mason, Anthony's chances of winning this battle would greatly increase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as the Dragonfang approached Mason's throat, a surge of overwhelming malevolent energy erupted from Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fierce wind raged, and within a 30-foot radius, the sand and gravel on the ground were all blown up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A highly dangerous aura enveloped Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The imminent death sent shivers down his spine. In an instant, Anthony's entire body was covered in goosebumps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a flash of cold light appeared beneath Mason's black robe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony focused his gaze and saw a wolf-like arm suddenly emerge from beneath the black robe, reaching for Anthony's throat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Shit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's mind went almost blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wolf-like arm proved that Mason had completed his transformation under the cover of his black robe!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason, who had just been on the defensive, shockingly transformed into a real werewolf!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that he had also pretended to be weak, waiting for the right moment to strike and planned to kill Anthony in one blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason was really cunning!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stupid fool, prepare to die!" The wolf's claw approached, and Anthony's ear rang with Mason's fierce voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the next second, Anthony, who had been frightened stiff, oddly took a small step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was this small step that allowed Anthony to dodge Mason's lethal claw almost impossibly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp claws, carrying a piercing force, slashed across Anthony's neck, leaving three visible blood marks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This step was crucial!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if it were just 0.01 seconds slower, this claw would have been enough to tear Anthony's throat to shreds!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dodging the claw, Anthony took several quick steps back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flash of panic crossed his face, mingled with the surprise of having narrowly escaped death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was way too touch-and-go!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the critical moment, had it not been for Devil Eye timely warning him of the impending danger, Anthony would surely have died!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Anthony saw Mason's claws, Devil Eye had also given him a warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, the claw emerging from the black robe and Anthony's dodge happened almost simultaneously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To the naked eye, it seemed as though Anthony's dodge was a split second late, but that was not the case.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Anthony had waited to see Mason's claws before dodging, he definitely wouldn't have made it in time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking a few steps back, Anthony swallowed hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Devil Eye's warning was incredibly precise and timely, saving his life once again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony darted away, narrowly avoiding the blow. Mason was taken aback, and the movement of his hands noticeably paused for a second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was certain that no one could evade this attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anthony, a test subject, managed to dodge it so smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was clearly a casual small step, yet it was incredibly precise and timely in evading his long-planned lethal strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn sly bastard!" After a moment of shock, Mason shouted, "It looks like I really underestimated you! But from now on, I won't give you any more chances!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant after his words, Mason suddenly rushed forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a Level B metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After fully transforming into a werewolf, his strength surged!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While sprinting, Mason turned into a black whirlwind, moving so fast that he seemed like a fleeting shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the black whirlwind flash over, Anthony, without needing the Devil Eye to remind him, immediately rolled on the ground in a rather clumsy manner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His seemingly clumsy move actually allowed him to dodge Mason's attack with incredible speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black whirlwind brushed past, and Mason forcefully planted his feet on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the marble floor exploded!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst the rising dust and smoke, cracks spread out several feet from where he landed, looking extremely terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His formidable strength commanded awe and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason's speed was too fast for Anthony to track his movements, leaving him no choice but to activate the Devil Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After activating the Devil Eye, Anthony's entire body trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the midst of the dust and smoke, Mason charged forward once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without the power of the Devil Eye, he might not have been able to catch sight of Mason at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Anthony's whole body shook as he channeled his inner strength rapidly into his legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the wolf's claws came slashing towards him, he shifted his feet, causing his waist and limbs to twist at an odd angle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony sidestepped three feet away, evading Mason's wolf claws once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used the Whirlwind Step!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's technique crystal almost covered all combat skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, when he faced Dariel, he used this technique for the first time and it yielded good results. However, he approached that match with Dariel as practice. Now, facing Mason, the situation was extremely urgent, so he gathered his focus and pushed this skill to its limits, making it even more powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he couldn't defeat Mason due to the difference in levels, he could at least manage to evade another dangerous attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's confidence in himself had increased a bit more.</span></p></div>
