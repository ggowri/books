        <h1>Chapter 79 Live and Die Together</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin kept on chattering for a long time, but Anthony ignored him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, Anthony's casual words immediately made Alvin angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Alvin cursed angrily, he said to Rose, "Rose, I advise you again. It's not too late to hand over Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, the werewolf army will really rush in. By then, the Turner family will be devastated and destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure you will gamble the lives of everyone in the Turner family because of a bastard?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone said, "That's right. Ms. Turner, please hand over Anthony quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Turner family's hundreds of years of foundation cannot be destroyed just like this. Anthony. You bastard, if you are a man, get out of here and die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another woman said, "Yes. Get out and die, so as not to bring trouble to the Turner family and to all of us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another man said, "You damned bastard! You coward! Get out of here now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd, led by Alvin, all stood up, yelling at Rose and cursing at Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While cursing, many of them took a few steps forward and glared at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all looked ferocious as if they were going to attack together and capture Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up. You have no right to interfere in the Turner family's affairs," said Rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was furious and waved her hand, saying, "Anthony risked his life to save me. He is a great benefactor of the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am a woman, but I know I should be grateful and give back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, even if the Turner family has to sacrifice everything, we will live and die together with Anthony."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose sounded powerful with a resounding voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she took a step forward, her eyes firm and her head held high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she was a woman, at this moment, she exuded an invisible domineering aura from her body, which was of a superior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great! Rose, you're great," said Anne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Rose being so strong, she gritted her teeth in anger and said angrily, "I really don't know what kind of magic potion this bastard has fed you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you are determined to lead the Turner family to destruction, just wait to die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." Rose was about to say something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anthony interrupted her and said casually, "She's just a clown. There's no need to get angry with her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, he said to the Turner family member beside the screen. "Turn on the surveillance of the east gate. It's time for the werewolves to launch the final attack."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" The man was stunned for a moment, looked at Anthony in confusion, and then looked at Rose blankly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, to most members of the Turner family, Anthony was still an outsider.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing the man's gaze, Rose said neatly, "Anthony's words are my orders. Turn on the surveillance of the east gate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Ms. Turner." Getting Rose's order, the man turned the surveillance footage of the east gate onto the screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what was puzzling was that the east gate was calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were only more than thirty guards of the Turner family, ready for battle, but there was no sign of the werewolf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The screen was divided into four parts. The other three gates were already filled with smoke, and the battle had lasted for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tranquility at the east gate seemed a little weird.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When everyone was confused, the howling of wolves came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dark shadows rushed out from the hidden alleys near the east gate and quickly </span><span>gathered towards the east gate like a tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone said, "It's the werewolves. The werewolves are coming. Everyone, line up. Meet the enemy with all your strength."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the werewolves attacked, the well-trained guards immediately formed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, unlike the other gates, there were too many werewolves at the east gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were densely packed like locusts, running wildly all the way, with sand flying everywhere, making a considerable noise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a closer look, the more than thirty guards all felt a tingling sensation on their scalps and a chill on their backs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because they had never imagined that there would be so many werewolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other gates had no more than thirty werewolves, but there were at least a hundred of them at the east gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry up. The east gate requests support." The leading guard did not dare to waste time and chose to ask for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not that they were too weak, but he knew very well that with only thirty of them, they would not be able to stop hundreds of werewolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in this situation, most of the guards of the Turner family were supporting other places. How could there be extra personnel to support the east gate?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing that there was no hope for support, the leading guards' eyes turned red, and he said in a deep voice, "The Turner family has treated us well, and it is the chance for us to repay the family now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, even if it means risking your life, you cannot let a werewolf set foot in the Turner Manor. Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir," said the other guards in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them!" Thirty guards then drew their swords, flashing cold light, and shouted in unison, shaking the earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them was full of vigor and held their heads high. Even though they knew they were no match for their opponents, they still refused to give in and were ready to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the werewolves rushed over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their murderous aura was enough to make one's scalp numb even before the fight started.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the next second, the werewolves that were rushing toward the guards stopped 109 feet away.</span></p></div>
