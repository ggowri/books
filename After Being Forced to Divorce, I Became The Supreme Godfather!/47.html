        <h1>Chapter 46 The Real Murderer</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was in a frenzy, desperate to catch Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing in the midst of the chaos, Anthony felt utterly helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had known the risks yet still insisted on coming. Now, there was no way to escape; he could only grit his teeth and get out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he stepped out, the Turner family guards rushed forward, all of them loading their weapons, dozens of barrels pointing straight at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Put your hands up. Hold your head and squat down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Follow orders immediately or we'll shoot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with the guards' frantic threats, Anthony got worked up. He pulled out the invitation Rose had given him and shouted, "Look! I'm a VIP guest invited by Ms. Turner to her party.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing right now? Is this how you treat your guests?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His challenge left the guards at a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To them, Anthony was nothing more than an unforgivable killer, a sworn enemy. When had he suddenly become a distinguished guest?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family's invitations were reserved for representatives of wealthy or noble families. How could Anthony, a nobody who had been kicked out of the Smith family, possibly receive one?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could the invitation be fake?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the guards hesitate, Alvin quickly interjected, "His invitation has to be fake! He's a nobody with no power or influence. How could he ever qualify for an invitation from the Turner family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't let him fool you! His last assassination attempt failed; this time, he's just trying to escape using a counterfeit invitation to carry out another attack against Ms. Turner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take him down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne also gritted her teeth and shouted, "I'm Anthony's ex-wife. I can testify that he's the murderer. Go get him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other guests shared their disdain for Anthony, echoing shouts demanding the Turner Guards to take him out immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards, irritated by the uproar, felt their tempers flare. A few of the less disciplined ones, eager to get rewards, couldn't resist pulling the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Rose's sake, Anthony didn't want to fight the guards. Even though surrounded, he could easily take them all out if he unleashed his full power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He called out again, "I'll say it again! I am a distinguished guest invited by Ms. Turner </span><span>to her birthday party.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Put down your guns and let me in. If Ms. Turner finds out, you won't be able to handle the fallout!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Anthony mention Rose's name, the guards exchanged uncertain glances. Just then, a fierce howl echoed in the distance, followed by a shadow swooping down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader barked, "Captain Stein is here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Form up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the guards retracted their weapons and lined up neatly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A muscular man in black landed from mid-air, causing the ground to tremble upon impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The captain of the Turner Guards was indeed a powerhouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony recognized him&mdash;it was Dariel Stein, the wolf metahuman who led the Turner Guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel's expression was grim, and his sharp gaze was locked onto Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two exchanged looks, each trying to gauge the other's intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're Anthony. You..." Dariel finally spoke, his voice tight with barely restrained fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anticipating his words, Anthony cut him off, shouting, "Dariel, as the captain of the Turner Guards, you conspired to assassinate Ms. Turner. What punishment do you deserve for that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This abrupt accusation not only shocked the onlookers but also left Dariel bewildered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you talking about?" he fumed, his face paling. "I'm loyal to the Turner family and to Ms. Turner. There's no way I would ever betray her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't make baseless accusations!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony smirked. "I have proof. You can't deny it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furious, Dariel clenched his teeth. "Bullshit! What proof do you have? Speak up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what you say, I won't let you go today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing Dariel's unease, Anthony pressed on, "First, as captain of the Turner Guards, you were supposed to pick Ms. Turner up from the Dragon Guild that day. I was with Ms. Turner and Helen at the time, and they had to take my car home because you didn't show up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where were you? You deliberately delayed picking up Ms. Turner to create an opportunity for the real murderer. Are you still going to deny it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel glared at him, his teeth grinding, but he struggled to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he could manage, with eyes blazing, was, "I was delayed because I received other orders at the last minute. I'm loyal; I would never betray Ms. Turner!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, you murderer! Don't twist the truth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony sneered, "Really? Then listen. My second piece of evidence is that I clearly protected Ms. Turner&mdash;I was her savior. But you claim I'm the killer. Why would you do that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only the real murderer would be so eager to label me as the culprit to divert suspicion. Am I right?"</span></p></div>
