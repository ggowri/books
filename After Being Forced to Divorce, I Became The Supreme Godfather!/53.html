        <h1>Chapter 52 Carolyn Turner</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the ochre-colored tornado spun faster and faster, Anthony felt like he was on the brink of being torn apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel summoned every ounce of his strength and shouted, "No!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please show mercy, Ms. Carolyn Turner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following the shout, his men rushed toward the tornado, shouting for mercy at the top of their lungs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The swirling vortex began to slow down. Gritting his teeth, Anthony turned his gaze towards Dariel outside and asked, "Dariel, who is Ms. Carolyn Turner? Why is she trying to kill me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel shouted, "Ms. Carolyn Turner is Ms. Turner's aunt, and she currently heads the Turner family. Anthony, you need to beg for mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fury surged through Anthony at Dariel's explanation. Instead of pleading for his life, he yelled towards the manor, "Alright! Since you're Rose's aunt and in charge of the Turner family, let me ask you this: are you the one who declared that I'm the murderer </span><span>who assassinated Rose?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't believe you can't tell right from wrong. And I don't believe Rose didn't tell you that I saved her! Why did you publicly label me as the murderer?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you twist things?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want a reasonable explanation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, even if I get killed here, I will not accept it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally unleashed the anger that had been building within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel had previously mentioned he hadn't seen Rose either. The news of Anthony being the murderer had come from the head of the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that Carolyn was the one spreading this falsehood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Rose's aunt and the head of the Turner family, Anthony couldn't believe that she didn't know the truth&mdash;that he had saved Rose. She must have known, yet still chose to falsely accuse him. What was her game?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, the tornado, which had just begun to calm, whirled back to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within its eye, the centrifugal force sucked the air away from Anthony, making him feel as if he were on the verge of being torn apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he gritted his teeth and, instead of begging, shouted even more vehemently, "You idiot! You can't tell right from wrong, and you're so ungrateful! Who do you think you are to run the Turner family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder even Ms. Turner was targeted for assassination! You might be the real murderer behind all this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You tried to kill her and accused me just to hide your own guilt!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what if you're an Earth-element Metahuman? So what if you have incredible skills? Even if I die here today, I will not rest in peace!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will come back to haunt you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He delivered the last sentence with immense effort, and blood spurted from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony understood that Carolyn was a formidable Earth-element Metahuman with profound skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Devil Eye had chosen to retreat in her presence, and he knew he stood no chance against her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Carolyn truly wanted him dead, then today would be his last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could accept death, but he would not accept dying unjustly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed to voice his grievances before he went.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel's face went pale at Anthony's outburst. No one in the Turner family had ever dared to speak to Carolyn like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have a death wish? Shut up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, beg for mercy!" he urged frantically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite meeting Anthony for the first time, Dariel felt a bond forming through their earlier confrontation and had a favorable impression of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he hoped Anthony would expose the true murderer and didn't want him to die at Carolyn's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Anthony's resolve, Dariel resorted to shouting towards the manor, "Please, Ms. </span><span>Carolyn Turner, have mercy! Anthony is Ms. Turner's distinguished guest. He even promised to deliver the real murderer as a gift to Ms. Turner!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Carolyn Turner, please consider the bigger picture!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tornado slowed down again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the center, Anthony clenched his teeth and glared, using the last of his willpower to hold on. He was too exhausted to speak; if he opened his mouth now, he would surely vomit blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he remained unconvinced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His bloodshot eyes fixed on the manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed that Carolyn could see him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in death, he wanted that unreasonable woman to know he refused to accept this fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, an elder woman's deep voice emerged from within, "You took some drugs and dared to cause chaos at the Turner Manor while pretending to be the King Tiger. You truly deserve a beating!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You claimed you weren't affiliated with the mutant werewolf, yet you were clearly using the same type of drugs!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll give you a chance to confess the truth. Otherwise, I'll kill you first to serve as a warning to others!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Say it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that final command, the tornado abruptly vanished. As the pressure lifted, Anthony collapsed to the ground, barely conscious, spitting up blood, his face frighteningly pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, instead of pleading for mercy, he stared at the gate of the Turner Manor and sneered.</span></p></div>
