        <h1>Chapter 183 Ready to Kill</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony wasn't </span><span>just </span><span>worried about facing a few hundred opponents. He could handle them if he had to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But taking them on single-handedly would waste precious time, and he knew Vincent must have already figured out this was a scheme. </span><span>Maybe</span><span> Vincent</span><span> </span><span>was rushing back at full speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyway, t</span><span>ime wasn't on Anthony's side. He needed to end this quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Carolyn's concerned expression, Anthony cut straight to the point. "Stay close behind me, Aunt Carolyn. You don't need to fight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are... are you sure about this?" Carolyn hesitated, worry evident in her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Anthony could respond, Anne's commanding voice rang out from across the battlefield. "Get them! One hundred million to whoever kills Anthony!" She stood tall, projecting the authority of a military commander. "This bounty never expires. Kill Anthony, and you'll be richly rewarded!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her furious shout echoed through the valley, carrying the weight of someone used to commanding armies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Guys</span><span>, let's take him together! We'll split the bounty!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The promise of wealth had the desired effect. Anne's words ignited an immediate frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they </span><span>weren't idiots. They knew Anthony's reputation and understood that taking him down wouldn't be easy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, e</span><span>ven the strongest warrior could be overwhelmed by numbers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thunder of hundreds of feet pounding against the ground filled the </span><span>place</span><span>. The </span><span>sound was deafening, reverberating off the valley walls like rolling thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay close!" Anthony's eyes flashed with determination. Without waiting for the mob to reach them, he charged headlong into the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was determined to end this quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a crackling surge of energy, he leaped into action. His hands transformed into deadly claws, sparking with miniature lightning bolts&mdash;the Thunder Claw in full force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood sprayed through the air as Anthony tore through the family bodyguards like they were nothing more than paper targets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their numbers, he was unstoppable, leaving a trail of destruction in his wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In mere seconds, over a dozen men lay scattered across the ground, some thrown through the air, others collapsed in pools of blood, their lives hanging in the balance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's face darkened as she watched the carnage unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's power had grown significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His attacks were more vicious, more decisive&mdash;the ruthlessness of his strikes sent chills down her spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this rate, even though their forces might eventually stop him, the cost would be devastating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne felt panic rising in her chest&mdash;but then a cruel smile crossed her face as an idea struck her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, Anthony seemed invincible right now, but Rose and Carolyn looked completely defenseless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get Carolyn!" Anne shouted, pointing urgently. "Quick! Circle around and grab both Carolyn and Rose!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After fighting their way through, Anthony and his companions finally emerged from the narrow valley into more open terrain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone had been so focused on Anthony that they'd failed to notice Rose and her companion earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until Anne shouted that the crowd realized Rose and Carolyn were struggling to keep up with Anthony's advance, supporting each other as they moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take them down!" Anne commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Responding to her order, a wave of black-clad figures broke away from the main group, bypassing Anthony to charge straight at Rose and Carolyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastards!" Anthony roared, hearing Anne's command. He wasn't about to let them reach the women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a blur of motion, Anthony cut off their advance, </span><span>Dragonfang</span><span> gleaming in his hand. The ancient blade sang through the air as he unleashed a series of devastating strikes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blade flashed through the air without warning. The fastest attackers didn't even have time to dodge as they ran straight into its deadly arc.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the blade carved through their bodies, leaving the black-clad figures torn apart. Blood and viscera scattered across the ground in a gruesome display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The metallic stench of blood filled the air, carried by the wind along with a fine crimson mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining attackers froze in their tracks, their scalps tingling with primal fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's power was overwhelming. They were completely outmatched. To him, they were nothing more than bugs. A single casual swing of his blade could tear them to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What good were their numbers? The gap in power between them was like heaven and earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the attackers' hesitation, Anthony spoke coldly while holding Rose close. "Sure, the bounty's tempting," he said, gripping </span><span>Dragonfang</span><span> tightly. "But you've only got one life. Once you're dead, that money won't mean a thing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Rose in one arm and </span><span>Dragonfang</span><span> in the other, Anthony moved forward cautiously, Carolyn following close behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Anthony took a single step forward, the crowd collectively backed away, their faces pale with fear. No one dared to make the first move against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony had made his point. The bounty was tempting, sure, but they needed to be alive to spend it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cowards!" Anne spat out. She tried to rally the men. "What are you all afraid of? He's just one man! Don't forget, he's nothing but a test subject. Once the drug wears off, he'll be completely helpless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony remained silent, his eyes burning with murderous intent as he took another deliberate step forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd scrambled backward again. Anne's words carried no weight. Everyone could see the deadly threat before them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>T</span><span>he drug would wear off eventually, but how many of them would Anthony kill before that happened?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They weren't </span><span>that stupid</span><span>. No one was going to risk their neck for this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Fuck</span><span>!" Anne's face contorted with rage. "You worthless bunch of cowards!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes blazed as she shouted, "The moment you joined the Evil Spirit Legion, you gave up your right to fear death! Desertion is our gravest sin!" She jabbed her finger at the crowd. "If any of you take one more step back, I swear I'll kill you myself&mdash;and your entire family with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to her elite guards. "Members of the Evil Spirit Legion, keep your eyes on these men. Anyone who retreats dies on the spot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, ma'am!" The black-clad members of the Evil Spirit Legion responded in unison, their weapons at the ready.</span></p></div>
