        <h1>Chapter 69 Serious Provocation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone present was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel was experienced in combat and reacted instantly, shouting, "Enemy attack. Everyone, listen to my orders, and prepare for defense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he had already drawn the submachine gun from his waist, ready for battle, and the hundreds of security team members he led also drew their guns quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, everyone was at a loss as to what to do. The howling of wolves came from all directions. It sounded like there were enemies everywhere, and they didn't know which side to defend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they were hesitating, Carolyn suddenly shouted, "Look at the sky."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone hurriedly looked up and saw a few black spots flying in the distance. They thought it was some powerful artillery shells and scattered in panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were several noises in succession, and the smell of blood instantly spread at the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it. They're our people." Dariel gritted his teeth and roared, and his eyes turned red in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that the four corpses falling from the sky were the four guards who had just sent Alvin and Anne away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been killed, and their bodies were thrown back in this way and fell to the ground, with their brains splattered and flesh and blood all over the place. It was horrible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose couldn't help but say angrily, "Could it be that the Blake family and the Smith family dared to retaliate? They are too arrogant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony smiled bitterly, "It's not the Blake family and the Smith family. They are just two small families. They don't have the courage and don't have the ability. Haven't you heard it yet? The wolf howl means the killer of the Evil Spirit Legion coming to take revenge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's expressions changed drastically at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most terrifying killer organization in the world, the Evil Spirit Legion, and the most horrible killer, the mutant werewolves, were here for revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone then suddenly remembered that the werewolf killer that Jane had brought not long ago was their accomplice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Listening to the howling of the wolves, no one knew how many of them were coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waves of murderous intent were in the air, and the initially warm air suddenly became filled with the cold smell of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every one shuddered, and some people turned pale and could not help but crawl under the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Carolyn Turner, Ms. Turner, I request to go into battle," said Dariel angrily, looking solemn and looking at Rose and Carolyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the familiar wolf howl, the wolf blood in his body, which made him bloodthirsty and warlike by nature, couldn't help but boil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Dariel was different from those werewolves outside. Those werewolves had signed soul contracts with the Evil Spirit Legion and had lost their self-will. They had no sense of right and wrong and were fallen evil spirits who only knew how to kill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Dariel was a warrior of justice and was eager to fight now to bite the throats of the villains with his teeth and split their chests with his sharp claws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn looked solemn, and she said angrily in a deep voice, "This group of evil spirits dared to besiege Turner Manor. I, Carolyn, swear that I will protect the manor and tear them into pieces. Dariel, listen to my orders..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait a moment." Carolyn was just about to give an order when a familiar voice came from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked up in surprise and saw that it was Alvin and Anne who were swaggering back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just now, they had been sent out by four guards. The werewolves had killed those four guards, and their bodies were thrown back. Everyone had thought that the two of them must have been killed, but they actually came back safe and sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only that, based on their expressions, they actually seemed a little proud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alvin, Anne, what's going on outside? How many werewolves are here? Why didn't they kill you?" asked Anthony worriedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin looked at Anthony and sneered, "Do you want to know why? I'll tell you now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked around at everyone and shouted, "Listen to me. The werewolves didn't kill us because they wanted us to be messengers. They have something for us to tell you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is it? Go ahead," said Carolyn in a deep voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne gritted her teeth and said, "Ms. Carolyn Turner, we respect you. The werewolves don't want to go to war with the Turner family. They said that they came here just to seek revenge on one person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, everyone followed Anne's gaze and looked at Rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had failed in their last attempt to assassinate Rose. According to the rules of the Evil Spirit Legion, they would not give up until they achieved their goal. Could it be that they besieged Turner Manor just to kill Rose?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That person is..." Anne deliberately prolonged her voice to whet everyone's curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alvin couldn't help himself and shouted excitedly, "Anthony."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Rose couldn't help but scream in surprise when she heard that the werewolf wanted to take revenge on Anthony instead of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony smiled slightly, not surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that the werewolf would come after him sooner or later, but he hadn't expected it to happen so soon. Moreover, they had always been hiding in the dark to carry out assassinations and never appeared in the light. This time, they actually went out in broad daylight and besieged the Turner Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not only a serious provocation to the Turner family but also a blatant challenge to the authority of Yoland.</span></p></div>
