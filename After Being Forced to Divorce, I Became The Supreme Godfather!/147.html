        <h1>Chapter 146 Anxious</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Retreat?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was too late!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony took a step forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The violent force swept in all directions in an instant, and an incomparably sharp aura suddenly enveloped the Black Cloak!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Cloak had no way to avoid it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in Black Cloak was helpless, but he made up his mind and poured all his strength into his claw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, the two separated as soon as they touched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a dull crash, like the sound of rocks collapsing. Under the impact, the Black Cloak retreated three steps in succession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before he could steady his steps, Anthony took advantage of the situation and pursued him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's forward pounce was ferocious!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where did you learn this technique?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Anthony's tiger claws rushing forward, the Black Cloak was frightened and retreated in panic while screaming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eagle Claw Attack?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Cloak was very proud of it. It was his most secret skill, and he would never show it to anyone unless it was absolutely necessary!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been many years since he last used it. But when he used it again, it was easily cracked by a loser.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's Thunder Claw was obviously more powerful and fiercer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Anthony's own strength was far beyond the Black Cloak's imagination!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Squeak!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Puff!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Cloak retreated in panic, while Anthony took advantage of the victory and became more and more courageous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Cloak was gradually defeated, and his clothes were torn apart bit by bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he dodged in time, he would not suffer any flesh injuries. However, if he failed to dodge in time, Anthony's claws would leave a bloody mark on his body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In mild cases, the skin and flesh were torn and blood gushed out. In severe cases, it might even hurt the bones!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the Black Cloak was fast and strong enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, Anthony would kill him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell? The Black Cloak..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my god! Can't the Black Cloak beat him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of skill is this? Is Anthony also a Warrior?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's not right. The Black Cloak is a Level B Warrior. Could it be that Anthony is also a Level B Warrior?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything changed so quickly that by the time the crowd reacted, the Black Cloak had already started running away miserably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was horrified and couldn't help but exclaim and talk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could have imagined that the Black Cloak was no match for Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he was being chased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, the Black Cloak could not bear it anymore and rushed towards Alvin, shouting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Level B Warrior was beaten so badly by Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Smith Manor was filled with guests. But at this moment, everyone was stunned, looking at the Black Cloak in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blake family's Shadow Sentinel, swore firmly that he would kill Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this was the result.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So surprising!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin in the crowd had a gloomy face, showing shock, fear, and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Level B Warrior was the Blake family's greatest reliance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he was defeated by Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What the hell!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why is this happening?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne was also dumbfounded, staring blankly at the Black Cloak and Anthony who was and becoming more and more courageous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She seemed not to recognize Anthony. How could this strong, domineering and powerful man be Anthony?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half a month ago, this man was still a loser who allowed her to beat and scold him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he beat the Black Cloak so badly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne walked quickly to Arthur and said, "Mr. Hastings, please subdue this lunatic, </span><span>Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The half a billion dollars will be paid within three days. If you can kill Anthony, I will pay an additional one hundred million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne was anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was unstoppable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Ben was disabled, and the Black Cloak was no match for him. It was impossible for the other security personnel, even if they were numerous, to stop Anthony!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this case, if she wanted to beat Anthony, she had only asked Arthur for help!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne reacted quickly and made decisions decisively without any hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cost and bonus were indeed exaggerated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even for the Smith family, it was a lot of money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, since it concerned the reputation of the Smith family, she couldn't care so much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, she was now the head of the Smith family, and using the money was not a big deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as she could save the reputation of the Smith family, it would be worth it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin also walked over quickly and said, "Mr. Hastings, please take action quickly and capture Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you can capture Anthony, everything will be fine. We'll pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin was in danger and might die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, he could not care so much. If he could capture Anthony and keep Alvin, a Level B Warrior, with the cost of half a billion dollars, it would not be a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Excuse me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in the expectant eyes of the two, Arthur smiled helplessly and shook his head, saying, "Our rule is not to be hired, not to fight lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, we do not accept temporary employment unless..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin exclaimed, and his eyes widened.</span></p></div>
