        <h1>Chapter 127 Be Ours!</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not coming?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's face darkened as she snapped, "He wouldn't dare! Besides, with Yoland locked down tight, where does he think he can run?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's true..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin nodded, then frowned. "Still, we can't underestimate Anthony's abilities, no matter what.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Something's off about that kid lately. His strength doesn't seem natural.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Foster is a Level B Metahuman, yet Anthony held his own for so long..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!" Before he could finish, Anne cut him off with a contemptuous snort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's just trash-pumped full of drugs. How strong could he really be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who knows? He might drop dead within three days anyway."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin ignored her anger-laden words and continued, "Draconic Shield has been making waves lately, taking down several security companies right after their debut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're calling themselves the Zodiac, and word is each member is stronger than the last. If we could get them on our side..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, before Anne could speak, Ben's cold laugh rang out from nearby. "Mr. Blake, got a problem with us brothers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony's nothing but garbage propped up by drugs. So what if he got lucky and lasted a few rounds against Mr. Foster?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give me whatever drugs he's taking, and I bet I could hold my own against Mr. Foster too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben, the head of security at the Smith family, was an Expert whose skills nearly matched those of a Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His abilities were nothing to sneeze at.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alvin praise Anthony so highly and deliberately invite outsiders for protection </span><span>naturally rubbed him the wrong way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin frowned, giving Ben a contemptuous look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, out of respect for Anne, he held his tongue and said instead, "That's not what I meant. I'm just trying to cover all our bases.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not just the Smith family, the Blake family has been considering this matter too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At these words, Black Cloak, who had been standing silently behind them, spoke up. "Mr. Blake, how come I haven't heard anything about this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yoland's Draconic Shield was making waves, and their reputation was undoubtedly impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Black Cloak knew this much for sure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he'd never heard anything about the Blake family planning to change their security team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a full-fledged Warrior, Black Cloak's power ranked among the top in Yoland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Black Cloak speak up, Alvin gave a helpless smile and said, "Black Cloak, what's this about? Worried about being replaced?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that's the case, you're overthinking it. You've served the Blake family loyally for years. They won't do you wrong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, Mr. Blake, you've misunderstood my meaning," Black Cloak said with a stern expression, shaking his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know a thing or two about the Draconic Shield you mentioned earlier. The Zodiac is powerful, yes, but their background is murky at best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A large group of mysterious yet powerful individuals suddenly showed up in Yoland. Something doesn't sit right with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So if Mr. Johnson truly intends to make contact with them, I'd advise extreme caution."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warning was well-intentioned and reasonable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Alvin could respond, Anne nodded and said, "Black Cloak is right. The Zodiac's sudden appearance and unclear motives are concerning. We'd better not rock the boat right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, with Black Cloak and Ben's team holding down the fort, what trouble could a lowlife like Anthony possibly cause?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they can't handle Anthony together, then the Draconic Shield's people probably can't either."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Smith makes excellent points."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Black Cloak was the first to speak up respectfully. "Don't worry, Mr. Johnson, Ms. Smith. If Anthony dares show his face, I'll be the first to end him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words carried a fierce intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The incident where he'd slipped up and been bested by Anthony in front of everyone still burned in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have complete faith in Black Cloak's abilities," Alvin declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing everyone's unanimous agreement, Alvin reluctantly nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a pause, he added, "Still, let's be honest here. Everyone's seen what the Zodiac is capable of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're a force to be reckoned with. Since we're inviting all the prominent Yoland families to this gathering, why not extend an invitation to the Draconic Shield folks, too?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First off, making allies with powerhouses like them can't hurt, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Second, we could use this chance to convince them to join Evil Spirit Legion with us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we pull this off, it'll be a major win. Mr. Foster would definitely reward us handsomely, don't you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before anyone else could speak, Alvin turned directly to Anne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's eyes lit up at his words. "Brilliant! Why didn't I think of that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're newcomers with no connections in Yoland. We won't even need to sweet-talk them much. If they join us, perfect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And if they refuse? One word from us, and no matter how strong they are, they'll lose their foothold in Yoland!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly!" Alvin nodded. "Once that's settled, their background won't matter anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After joining Evil Spirit Legion, we'll all be family. Yoland will soon be ours for the taking!"</span></p></div>
