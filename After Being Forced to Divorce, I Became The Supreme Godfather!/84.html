        <h1>Chapter 83 The Only Way Out</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The party involved was not very anxious about the matter, while those around them were very anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason's request was obviously a little difficult for everyone to accept.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, most people hadn't reacted yet. The reason why Anne reacted quickly was because she had already wanted to surrender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the previous banquet, she and Alvin repeatedly humiliated and provoked Leo Turner, angering Rose and Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, the two of them became furious and banned all cooperation, which almost ruined the future of the Blake family and the Smith family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, if the Turner family was not destroyed, then they would have no place to stand in Yoland in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the contrary, if the Turner family were destroyed, they would definitely be able to reach the top of Yoland in the future!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they had the help of the Evil Spirit Legion, then it would be just a matter of time before they replaced the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With support, things became easier to handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Anne, there was nothing wrong with joining the Evil Spirit Legion. On the contrary, it was a good thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why she was so decisive in choosing to swear allegiance to Mason and join the Evil Spirit Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, other people were different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had a large family and a high status in Yoland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did they join the Evil Spirit Legion?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only were they being controlled by others, but they also had to hand over all their property.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then again, the werewolves were coming with great force, and everyone's lives were in danger. Did they have any choice other than to surrender?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, many people began to hesitate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked at each other, each with their own ulterior motives, as if waiting for others' choices.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I do!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the crowd hesitated, Alvin finally reacted, knelt on the ground with a thud, and explained anxiously, "Mr. Foster, please calm down. It's not that I don't want to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was just frightened by this sudden surprise. To be honest, I have long wanted to join the Evil Spirit Legion...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, you are here, and I finally have a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I, Alvin, swear on behalf of the Blake family that, from now on, I will be loyal to you, Mr. Foster, and join the Evil Spirit Legion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to Anne, Alvin's reaction was obviously much slower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his attitude was exceptionally sincere, and his explanation sounded very serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked so excited, as if he had received a great blessing, and was so excited that he was almost in tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I do!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am willing to do so, and I beg the Mr. Foster to take me in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Foster, please understand. I have long wanted to join you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for the opportunity, Mr. Foster. From now on, I will follow your lead..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin knelt down with such a sincere attitude that no one else dared to hesitate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a crash, a large group of people knelt down at the feet of Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, everyone rushed to show their loyalty to him with all kinds of flattery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, there was still a small number of people who were still undecided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing them hesitate, Anne angrily scolded, "A bunch of ignorant people! Mr. Foster has given you chances many times. Don't you know how to cherish them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quick! Come here, kneel down, apologize to the Mr. Foster, and submit to him with me. Otherwise..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was cursing, Anthony stood up and said loudly, "Everyone, I hope you can think it over carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Evil Spirit Legion has committed many evil deeds, and everyone has the right to kill them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once you choose to surrender, there is no turning back, and you will be despised by the world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were a bunch of fence-sitters, and Anthony had no intention of dissuading them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he thought about it. If most people in Yoland defected to the Evil Spirit Legion, then even if the Turner family could survive this disaster, it would be difficult to move forward in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, Anthony didn't want the Evil Spirit Legion to take advantage of this incident to strengthen itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Evil Spirit Legion was the mortal enemy of the Godfather Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was bound to become the Godfather of the new generation in the future!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he ignores it, wouldn't it be like raising a danger to cause trouble?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Evil Spirit Legion is notorious. If I surrender, my grandfather will beat me to death..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, once we join the Evil Spirit Legion, there is no turning back..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I believe that the Turner family will not be defeated so easily..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, we must trust the Turner family..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Anthony's words, everyone was whispering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew what the consequences of joining the Evil Spirit Legion would be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless it was absolutely necessary, who would want to be associated with such an evil organization?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking in everyone's reactions, Anthony said, "Everyone, if you believe me, you don't have to do anything. You just need to stay in the Turner Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I promise that even if the Turner family and I risk our lives, we will definitely protect everyone from being harmed by werewolves..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this time, before he could finish, Anne angrily scolded, "Shut up, you </span><span>bastard! Others may not know, but don't I know you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've been married for three years, and you have been a complete piece of shit!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You still dare to brag about protecting everyone. How can you, a loser, protect everyone?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In my opinion, you have bad intentions and want to drag everyone down with you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have such a bad mind!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, don't you understand yet?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At this point, your only way out is to submit to the Mr. Foster!"</span></p></div>
