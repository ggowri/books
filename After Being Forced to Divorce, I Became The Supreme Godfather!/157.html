        <h1>Chapter 156 Game-Changer</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another strike came down, but Anthony dodged effortlessly, the machete sinking into a nearby tree instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sharp crack, the tree, thick as a man's waist, was sliced cleanly in half.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that all you've got?" </span><span>Necros</span><span> growled, his frustration mounting as his attack missed. "Pathetic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony smirked, a glint of amusement in his eyes. "Not bad, huh? Now it's my turn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flick of his wrist, the </span><span>Dragonfang</span><span> appeared in his hand, gleaming with an eerie blue light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nice blade."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Necros</span><span>' eyes narrowed as he locked onto it, a sneer curling his lips. "But you'll never get to use it because you're dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony raised an eyebrow. He wasn't worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, </span><span>Necros</span><span> was getting a bit too cocky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting a second, Anthony shot forward like a streak of light, closing the distance in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're way out of your league," </span><span>Necros</span><span> scoffed, charging at him with renewed fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's sudden aggression had clearly pushed </span><span>Necros</span><span>' buttons, and as they clashed, the force behind </span><span>Necros</span><span>' machete was fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Underestimating the opponent was a rookie mistake every Warrior knew to avoid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Necros</span><span> wasn't some greenhorn like Ben or a Black Cloak. He was a seasoned veteran, tough and battle-tested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he knew Anthony might not be his match, the moment Anthony made the first move, </span><span>Necros</span><span> didn't hold back. His counterattack was fierce and swift, showing no sign of mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anthony had already calculated his every move. In a flash, he darted sideways, moving faster than </span><span>Necros</span><span> could track.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a split second, </span><span>Necros</span><span> could only stare in shock as Anthony vanished from sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before </span><span>Necros</span><span> could react, a chilling wave of cold swept toward him. Without thinking, he swung his machete in defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was too late. Anthony's leg, moving like a whip, crashed into his elbow with brutal force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Necros</span><span>' body jolted, the impact stunning him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to pull back, but just as he did, Anthony's </span><span>Dragonfang</span><span> flashed across his shoulder, cutting deep, and blood sprayed out in a crimson arc.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" </span><span>Necros</span><span> roared in pain, his eyes burning with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he twisted his body to recover, the tip of </span><span>Dragonfang</span><span> grazed his neck, narrowly missing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's heart skipped a beat. He'd been certain that </span><span>Necros</span><span> was done for after that series of strikes, but the man was too fast. And his mind was just as sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shoulder wound was nothing to someone of </span><span>Necros</span><span>' caliber. For him, it was just a </span><span>flesh wound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony didn't waste a second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Necros</span><span>' dual machetes were coming at him, fast and from both sides, aiming straight for his vital spots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blood Shadow Saber!" Anthony shouted, just as he spotted the strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flick of his wrist, he tossed the </span><span>Dragonfang</span><span> into the air and caught it smoothly in the reverse grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In one fluid motion, he lunged forward, the machete slicing upward at </span><span>Necros</span><span>' throat in a clean arc.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do you know Blood Shadow Saber?!" </span><span>Necros</span><span> stumbled back, eyes wide with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood Shadow Saber was his secret technique, his trump card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now Anthony was using it against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony didn't waste time answering. His </span><span>Dragonfang</span><span> followed </span><span>Necros</span><span>' every move, as relentless as a shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each time </span><span>Necros</span><span> tried to retreat, Anthony was right there, closing the distance without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To make matters worse, the technique Anthony was using was the same one </span><span>Necros</span><span> had mastered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on here?! How are you doing this?!" </span><span>Necros</span><span> cursed under his breath, trying desperately to dodge, panic creeping into his voice. "</span><span>You just saw it once</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's version of Blood Shadow Saber wasn't quite as powerful, but that didn't matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What mattered was that </span><span>Necros</span><span> was thrown off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His movements were losing their precision, and Anthony pressed on, not giving him an inch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When </span><span>Necros</span><span> attacked earlier, Anthony hadn't been worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as </span><span>Necros</span><span> used Blood Shadow Saber, Anthony immediately recognized it for what it was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he activated his Devil Eye, copying the technique in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the upgrade, his Devil Eye could only copy stored techniques. But with the new 2.0 version, Anthony discovered he could now replicate the very techniques his opponents used in real-time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a </span><span>game-changer</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why Anthony had been dodging up until now. He wasn't afraid of </span><span>Necros</span><span> but was waiting for the right moment to turn the tables.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he had the technique down, Anthony moved even faster. When </span><span>Necros</span><span> faltered, Anthony's </span><span>Dragonfang</span><span> sliced across his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! You think you can just push me around?!" </span><span>Necros</span><span> yelled, clutching at the fresh wound, his face twisted in rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Anthony was about to make his next move, </span><span>Necros</span><span> roared, "Blood Shadow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The air around </span><span>Necros</span><span> rippled with dark energy, his aura exploding in a wave of sheer, violent power.</span></p></div>
