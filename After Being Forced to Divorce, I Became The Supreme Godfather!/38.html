        <h1>Chapter 37 The Healing Metahuman</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second werewolf, though alert and managing to retreat in time, wasn't fast enough. Half of his arm was sliced clean off by Dragonfang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He roared in agony, the sound echoing through the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining werewolf, sensing his companion's distress, immediately turned on </span><span>Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fully combat-ready werewolf, alongside another with half an arm severed, teamed up to confront Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But something miraculous happened. Anthony, who had been on the brink of death just moments ago, was now fighting like a man reborn. His fists hit with the force of a battering ram, his dagger slashed with deadly precision, and his overall combat power seemed to have increased tenfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolves, caught off guard by his sudden resurgence, were pushed back and could only growl in frustration as they struggled to keep up with his blows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The target is hiding behind the wall! I'll hold him off; you go for the kill! Hurry!" one of the werewolves snarled to his companion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, they split up. One engaged Anthony head-on, while the other attempted to circle around, slipping behind the wall to flank him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a mighty throw, Anthony hurled Dragonfang with every ounce of strength he had left. The blade sank deep into the back of the flanking werewolf, pinning him to the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second werewolf died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last remaining werewolf, seeing his companion fall, panicked. His eyes darted to the distance as the sound of roaring engines approached. The vibration in the air grew stronger, and a fleet of reinforcements was headed their way at breakneck speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear flashed in the werewolf's eyes. With a powerful leap, he stomped off the ground and shot through the window like a cannonball, disappearing into the shadows. Anthony gave chase, but by the time he reached the door, the creature was already bounding across rooftops, vanishing into the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flashing headlights and the roar of engines filled the air as countless cars sped toward them from every direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's the Turner family's guards! Anthony, we're saved!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen's excited voice rang out from behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony whipped his head around and caught sight of Helen helping Rose out. Rose's face was ghostly white, devoid of even the slightest hint of color. Were it not for Helen's support, she would have surely crumpled to the ground from sheer exhaustion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her pallor, her face lit up with a radiant smile upon seeing Anthony, and she said, "Thank you, my savior!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was overwhelmed with emotion. "I had no idea you were not only a renowned doctor but also a healing metahuman. If you hadn't healed me right when you did, I'd have been dead a long time ago."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, the pieces fell into place for Anthony. He now understood the significance of why recapturing Rose was the second mission on the Chosen Path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a healing metahuman, someone who could channel healing energy to rapidly restore a person's vitality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Rose by his side, he would have an endless reserve of energy, allowing him to fight on indefinitely. It was an invaluable ability, one that was far too important to overlook.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen chimed in, "It's good that you know! Ms. Turner nearly exhausted herself restoring your energy. I've never seen her work so hard for anyone before!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose smiled softly, "Helen, don't say that. It was Anthony who saved us. Anthony, it's not safe outside. Come back to the Turner Manor with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony glanced at the approaching guards from the Turner family, led by a hulking brute with murderous intent written all across his face. It was clear that Rose would be safe now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep breath and shook his head. "I'm going back to my place," he murmured. "See you later!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, he turned on his heel and headed toward the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony!" Rose called out hastily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry," he replied over his shoulder without looking back. "I accepted your invitation. I'll be there on time the day after tomorrow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he grabbed the werewolf he had pinned to the wall, leaped out the window, and bounded across the rooftops like the fleeing werewolf. Within moments, he disappeared into the darkness, leaving Rose and the others behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel, the captain of the Turner Guards, dropped to one knee before Rose, his face full of shame. "Please forgive me, Ms. Turner. I was late to rescue you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to chase down the murderer immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Rose, still looking in the direction where Anthony had vanished, whispered softly, "No need. I'm tired. Let's go home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As you command!" Dariel responded immediately. "Quickly! Escort Ms. Turner home!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony dashed back to the castle that had been left to him by Godfather, covering the distance in record time. He burst through the doors, his breath coming in ragged gasps as he dropped the werewolf's corpse in front of Seraph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph didn't even spare a glance at Anthony's bloodied and battered form. Instead, her attention was completely fixated on the werewolf's body. Her eyes shone with curiosity and excitement as she circled the corpse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not even a metahuman, but you managed to kill a mutant werewolf?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How on earth did you do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was tinged with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony gazed at the woman before him, her face angelic yet her figure devilishly captivating, and said with a note of irritation, "Don't start with that! First, let me ask you, can you tell where this guy came from?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph commanded, "Follow me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for a response, she grabbed the werewolf's body and headed toward the basement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, still puzzled by her motives, quickly followed her. As they descended into the basement, his eyes widened in sheer shock at the sight that greeted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once-abandoned warehouse had been transformed into something out of a high-tech laboratory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rows of massive computer mainframes hummed in the background, and huge screens flickered with data. Advanced machinery and strange chemical devices lined the walls, </span><span>and the entire place reeked of scientific experimentation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What on earth is all this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are these for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony stammered, his mind racing to make sense of the scene before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph didn't answer. Instead, she pulled on a white lab coat, instantly transforming herself into the picture of a dedicated scientist. She carefully placed the werewolf on a metal platform and slid it into one of the machines.</span></p></div>
