        <h1>Chapter 10 The Fourth Gift</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her joyful screams washed over the hall like a tidal wave, filling every corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was left in stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each wave of her passionate cries, it was impossible to deny she was lost in pure ecstasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the man who had brought her to that point was Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, you're incredible! I've never met a man like you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, the crowd only thought the voice sounded a bit familiar, but they couldn't quite place it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, it hit them. They were sure it was Scarlet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization spread like wildfire. Everyone's mouths dropped open in shock, their eyes turning to Alvin with a strange look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My aunt!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, you bastard! What did you do to her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin's face turned pale with fury as he shouted at Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony sneered, his tone cold, "Isn't it obvious? I did to her exactly what Bruce did to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you say? You filthy bastard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you waiting for? Get him! Kill him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll tear him apart!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin, utterly humiliated, was beside himself with rage. He screamed like a mad dog, throwing a tantrum as his anger boiled over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne quickly intervened. "Thomas, Anthony's caused a disaster. Are you still going to cover for him? Do you want to go down with him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Thomas found the way Anthony had turned the tables exhilarating, he knew he couldn't protect him any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Anthony with a cold, calculating gaze. "I can't protect you anymore. You're on your own now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned and walked away, flanked by his bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben, leading his own team of bodyguards, had been seething with anger. Seeing </span><span>Thomas step aside, he growled, "Anthony, you've dug your own grave. No one can save you now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of bodyguards, armed with knives and clubs, charged at Anthony with vicious intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A woman's worried cry echoed through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At once, everyone turned to her in surprise, their eyes wide with confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman's face flushed bright red, and she quickly explained, "It's not that I'm worried about him. I'm just afraid he might ruin the banquet hall!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more she protested, the more it became clear what she was really thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sounds of Scarlet's passionate cries in the video had made her start imagining what it would be like if she were in her place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Around her, many of the elegant women didn't speak, but their expressions said it all. They all glanced at Anthony, their concern evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turns out, not only was he handsome, but he was also quite skilled in other ways.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rumors of Anthony being impotent were just lies carefully spun by Anne and Alvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguards of the Smith family were highly trained, and everyone believed that Anthony was as good as dead today. But as the bodyguards rushed at him, an excited gleam sparked in Anthony's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted loudly, "Anne, Alvin. Keep your eyes wide open and watch closely! This fourth grand gift is one I'm adding just for you. A blood-soaked feast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his words echoed, a flicker of blue light appeared in his left eye. He swiftly touched the Dragon Ring on his left hand, and in an instant, the sharp Dragonfang dagger appeared in his grip. Without hesitation, he charged toward the bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two bodyguards at the front screamed in agony as they dropped to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought themselves the strongest, so they had led the charge, eager to take down Anthony and grab all the glory. But in an instant, the razor-sharp Dragonfang had slashed through their chests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What they didn't realize was that under the power of his Devil Eye, their every movement seemed like a child's game to Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anthony didn't stop. He was like a bloodthirsty wolf, diving into the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With every swing of the Dragonfang, another body hit the floor. His roar echoed through the chaos, a howl of rage that unleashed years of pent-up anger and frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A real man earns his dignity through battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to make those who had looked down on him pay in blood, kneeling at his feet, so he could climb step by step to the top of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers were frozen, unable to believe their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected the usually meek Anthony to explode with such terrifying killing intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this even possible?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy must have taken some kind of steroids to give him a temporary power boost! </span><span>He won't last long!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get up. Keep attacking!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if we have to wear him out, we'll finish him off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben roared angrily, continuing to issue commands for the assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony spotted Ben standing behind the crowd. With a sudden move, he appeared right in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!" Ben screamed, swinging a punch straight at Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anthony didn't dodge. He met the punch head-on with his own fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two fists collided with a sickening thud, and both men were pushed back. Their hands were shaken, blood dripping from their palms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben gritted his teeth. "Kid, let's see how long you can keep this up! Everyone, get in there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben's punch had drained nearly half of Anthony's remaining strength, his body weakening quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The glow from his Devil Eye was already fading, signaling he was reaching his limit. He couldn't afford to fight any longer. It was time to make a quick exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he turned and began heading toward the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin, watching this, turned coldly to a Black Cloak beside him. "Have you seen enough?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man sneered, "At first, I thought this kid might be a beast Metahuman, but now it's clear he isn't. Just like Ben said, he must have injected some kind of steroids.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, sir. He won't get away. I'll handle him right now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kid, surrender now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a roar, the old man leapt into the air, soaring across the hall like an eagle swooping down to catch its prey. His dark claws reached for Anthony's head, aiming for the kill.</span></p></div>
