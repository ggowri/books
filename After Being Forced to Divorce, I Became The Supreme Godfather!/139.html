        <h1>Chapter 138 A True Warrior</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Screw you!" Ben snarled with a twisted smirk. "You piece of trash, talking big even when you're about to die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you're so eager to die, don't blame me for what happens next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I swear I won't rest until I've killed you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his words died in the air, Ben's body tensed like a drawn bowstring before he launched himself forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His speed was breathtaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the onlookers could barely track his movement. He was nothing but a blur of light rushing toward Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Loser! Kneel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wind howled as Ben roared, his fist cutting through the air like an unstoppable force!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony stood perfectly still, seemingly paralyzed with fear. Ben was sure this punch would have his opponent groveling like a beaten dog!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as Ben continued his battle cry, he saw a foot appearing in his vision, growing larger and larger by the millisecond!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, that foot connected with his face&mdash;a perfect, solid hit!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a high kick, Ben went flying backward even faster than he'd charged forward!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Ben yelped as he flew a dozen feet through the air and crashed hard into the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The immense impact caused the wall to collapse with a roar, and Ben enveloped in a thick cloud of dust, flew into the Smith Manor courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Holy shit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ben went airborne, the crowd gasped in shock. Their eyes bulged, and their jaws dropped like they'd just seen a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How was this even possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben, who was practically at Warrior level, just got kicked and sent flying?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of steroids was Anthony on? How did he get so strong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd took a few intuitive steps back, completely stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their smug expressions of schadenfreude quickly transformed into shock and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard! You fucking sucker-punched me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the crowd was still reeling, Ben roared and burst out of the courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon closer inspection, blood was streaming from Ben's nose and mouth, and there was a very prominent shoe print plastered across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone in the crowd couldn't hold it in anymore and almost burst out laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, it had to be a cheap shot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Must've been a sucker punch. How else could a loser like Anthony be this strong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's what losers do! He resorts to dirty tricks. That doesn't take any real skill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Ben's wounded pride, several members of the Smith family immediately jumped in, hurling verbal abuse at Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A sneak attack?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's face darkened, and he sneered. "He was the one who attacked first. My counterattack is considered a sneak attack? Are you all blind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His retort left the Smith family members gritting their teeth, yet unable to refute his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Screw you! Don't get cocky, Anthony!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben stepped forward, advancing with large strides as he snarled, "I let my guard down earlier, but don't think I'll go easy on you this time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking that kick, Ben's eyes were blazing with murderous intent, like a wild beast ready to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony smiled coolly and replied, "In that case, you'd better fight at full strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For just a Level A Warrior, you're sure putting on quite an act. What's with all the pretense?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben's heart skipped a beat, his face flickering with surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did he know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was right. Ben's power wasn't just approaching Warrior level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had recently broken through. He was now a full-fledged Warrior!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Anthony said, Ben had been hiding his true strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judging by their reactions, Anne and the Smith family higher-ups must have known about this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, when Anthony dropped this bombshell, Anne and the others' expressions changed dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Smith family hadn't really intended to keep this a secret forever. They were just waiting for the right moment for Ben to make a spectacular revelation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For instance, once the Evil Spirit Legion representatives arrived, they planned to recommend Ben and have him demonstrate his Warrior powers in public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would surely elevate the Smith family's standing in the Evil Spirit Legion's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they never expected that Anthony, whom they considered worthless, would see through their plan and expose it publicly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damn it all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of silence, Ben sneered, "Well, well... so this loser managed to see through my true abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since that's the case, let me show you, you worthless nobody, what a true Warrior's power looks like!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ben spoke, he unleashed the power within him. In an instant, the stone tiles beneath his feet shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A powerful aura swept across the area, stirring up winds and clouds of dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Warrior? Ben is actually a Warrior!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Holy shit! A real Warrior! Captain Ben has broken through!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is insane! Captain Ben's been holding back all this time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony's dead meat now. Whether he fights dirty or uses those sketchy pills, there's no way he can match a Warrior!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's just trash anyway, never stood a chance. All he knows are cheap tricks..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben had broken through, and the crowd was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A true Warrior's strength far surpassed that of an Expert who was merely approaching Warrior level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd buzzed with excitement, falling over themselves to praise Ben and the Smith family.</span></p></div>
