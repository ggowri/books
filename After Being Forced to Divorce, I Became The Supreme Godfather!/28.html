        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Driven by curiosity, he stepped closer and activated Devil Eye to inspect them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, Devil Eye shone with a soft blue glow, visible only to him, scanning the Eldergleam Fungus. He then engaged the data analysis feature, which was loaded with an extensive library of spiritual medicine knowledge, allowing him to rapidly process the information and arrive at a conclusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truth became clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He now grasped the reason behind Anne's willingness to bear such indignity; she had been nudging him to advise Rose to select option A.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you discern the real from the fake?" Rose asked, worry lacing her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony met her gaze. "In your opinion, which one is the real one?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose glanced around to ensure no one was eavesdropping before leaning closer, her lips brushing against his ear as she whispered, "To me, both seem off. B has the scent of Eldergleam Fungus, but it's spliced together from several strains, each between one hundred and three hundred years old. It's rare, yes, but not the thousand-year-old elixir we're looking for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for A, something's not right. I've got a hunch it's a fake, probably just a plastic coating."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony smiled, "I have a different opinion. Let's talk about it after the bidding begins."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two specimens were then carried by the staff and passed around the other bidders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin, growing impatient, finally called out, "Enough! We can start the bidding now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether it's real or not, it's up to your own judgment. Don't regret your move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chorus of agreement followed, as if the bidders had already conspired among themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane, watching the room with a discerning eye, declared the bidding open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin didn't waste a second. "In my opinion, B is the real one. I bid ten million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone close by instantly exclaimed, "A thousand-year-old Eldergleam Fungus is a rarity on this earth! I'll offer twenty million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a life-saving treasure. Twenty million is too low. I choose B, thirty million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bids for B climbed rapidly, reaching fifty million in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A, on the other hand, sat neglected, untouched by the frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose felt confused. "Although B is spliced, the individual parts are rare treasures aged between one hundred and three hundred years. They're precious. Even if fifty million is a bit steep, this is essentially priceless. Anthony, I'm considering buying it for sixty million. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony shook his head. "Do you trust me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose blinked, confused by the sudden question. "What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trust me," Anthony replied. "Let me handle the bidding for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Rose could respond, Anthony grabbed her auction paddle and stood up, his voice ringing through the room. "Ms. Turner chooses A, offering five million and ten thousand dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following that bold declaration, the entire room fell into a momentary hush, only to erupt into a cacophony of excited chatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony had bid for A, the one everyone suspected to be fake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he had only increased the starting bid by a paltry ten thousand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A murmur of disbelief rippled through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne let out a long breath, her heart settling with relief. She was well aware that Anthony lacked the expertise to discern the authenticity of spiritual medicine. Last night, she had misled him into believing that A was genuine, and it was clear he had taken the bait.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Poor Anthony, you're still far too trusting!" Anne thought to herself with a mix of triumph and pity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the auction at an end, Anne planned to unveil the deception. At that point, Rose would surely feel deceived by Anthony, leading to a rift between them. This would be the perfect opportunity for Anne and Alvin to make their move, offering the genuine one to Rose, thereby earning her trust and paving the way for profitable collaborations.</span></p></div>
