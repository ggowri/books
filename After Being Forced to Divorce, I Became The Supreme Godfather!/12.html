        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Devil Eye preheating complete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Initiating primary evolution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Merging with brain neurons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fusion complete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Current version: 1.0. Enhanced vision and night vision; able to breach basic-level electronic security; basic data analysis function; basic physical enhancement: the strength of a tiger, the speed of a leopard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ding!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Weakness detected in host's body, activating automatic enhancement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enhancement complete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Current host body level: Tiger and Leopard Physique."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, still unconscious, heard the voice of the Devil Eye echoing in his mind. </span><span>When the final prompt confirmed the enhancement was complete, he snapped his eyes open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A blue light radiated from his left eye, and before him, a holographic blue screen flickered to life, filled with data.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So the Devil Eye had only been warming up before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, this was the real deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony could feel the explosive power coursing through his body. As expected, he now had the strength of a tiger and the speed of a leopard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an incredible feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was one thing Anthony didn't understand, the ability to breach basic-level electronic security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze shifted to a surveillance camera in the corner. With a mere thought, his consciousness followed the unseen electronic pathways and infiltrated the entire surveillance system.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Images began to form in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could see every corner of the palace now under his watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the steady rush of water from the next room caught his attention. A quick mental command, and he accessed the hidden camera in the adjacent room, seeing what was happening inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A graceful blonde woman, her figure like a sculpture, was slowly removing her golden armor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony felt his head spin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman's bare skin glowed like a goddess statue, her chest towering like snow-capped mountains. Her flat belly, long, toned legs... her body was flawless, the work of a divine creator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her blue eyes, shimmering like gems from the depths of the sea, were mesmerizing, drawing him in without resistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clearly had no idea there was a hidden camera. Once she was undressed, she walked slowly into the bathroom, stepping into the cascade of water from the shower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bathroom door was left ajar, and Anthony watched as she gently lathered her body with her hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt an almost uncontrollable urge to transform into the mist itself, to touch her smooth skin from every angle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he tasted something salty on his lips. He wiped his mouth, only to find blood dripping from his nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind raced. "She saved me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could I be spying on her like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guilt washed over him, but his eyes betrayed him. Without thinking, he used the Devil Eye to look once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the woman who had been bathing just moments ago was gone. All that remained was the shower head, still spraying a steady stream of water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do I look good?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Anthony was still trying to make sense of everything, a soft, melodic voice suddenly broke the silence. He whipped around, his eyes widening in shock. The </span><span>woman was standing in front of him, completely naked, moving toward him like a goddess bathed in the morning dew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a panic, Anthony tried to sit up, but before he could, she was already at his bedside, pressing her hand firmly against his chest. Without warning, she straddled him, her legs parting as she positioned herself on top of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony stared, completely stunned by the sight of her. Just as the nosebleed he'd stopped moments ago started up again, he could hardly believe what was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm Seraph," she said softly. "The Godfather's gift to you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As my master, you're free to enjoy this gift however you like."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could react, she took his hand and placed it on her full, firm chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's throat went dry, and heat surged through his body. So, this was the reward from his grandfather. He must've done well on his first task if the Godfather was this pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A part of him wanted to push her down and claim her right then and there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But suddenly, the voice of the Devil Eye echoed in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be careful! Analysis shows she's teasing you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can't control yourself, you'll not only regret it, but you'll also be left vulnerable, becoming her slave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony took a deep breath, forcing himself to clear his mind. The fire of desire in his eyes flickered and slowly faded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seraph? Not bad. But what's the deal with those wings?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph blinked in surprise, clearly not expecting him to regain his composure so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she answered with a hint of seriousness, "I'm not an avian Metahuman. I can't grow wings. Those are bio-mimetic wings, one of the latest inventions from the Godfather's research institute."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's eyes lit up. "Wait... does that mean I could get a pair too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The image of Seraph soaring through the sky to save him last night still burned in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could have wings, he could fly anywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph's eyes flashed with amusement. "That depends on your level. Why don't you check your Dragon Ring?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony immediately looked down at the Dragon Ring on his left hand. A star inside it was now glowing steadily, no longer just a flicker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized the constant glow meant he had completed the task and passed the trial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eager to see what rewards awaited him, he moved to check the Dragon Ring. But Seraph, sensing his intent, grabbed his hand again, her voice dripping with temptation. "Why rush? Don't you want to enjoy your gift first?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get off me!" Anthony grunted, using his waist strength to flip Seraph off the bed. "Stop distracting me. I need to check my Dragon Ring!"</span></p></div>
