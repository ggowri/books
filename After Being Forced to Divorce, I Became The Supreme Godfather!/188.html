        <h1>Chapter 187 Impossible</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A crimson mist spread rapidly through the air, engulfing everything in mere seconds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood-red fog carried an energy that sent chills down one's spine, radiating a presence that made even the bravest hearts quiver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its murderous energy felt like an ancient beast unleashed&mdash;wild, savage, and utterly </span><span>terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, who had been charging forward, stopped dead in his tracks. "Blood Shadow? How the hell does he know that technique?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes widened in shock. But realization quickly dawned on him&mdash;Arthur had mentioned they were quadruplets. Of course, they would share the same abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The memory of his defeat by </span><span>Necros</span><span> flashed through Anthony's mind. Blood Shadow had been the deciding factor in that battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without it, Anthony was confident he could have killed </span><span>Necros</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Mordred was somewhat stronger than </span><span>Necros</span><span>, Anthony believed he still stood a chance if he went all out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With no other options left, Anthony went all in for a desperate final attack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He activated his Devil Eye and closed the distance using Whirlwind Step. In rapid succession, he unleashed a devastating combo&mdash;Super Fist, Thunder Claw, and Killing Kick&mdash;all enhanced by his Devil Eye. The relentless assault pushed Mordred to the brink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the finishing blow, Anthony planned to break through Mordred's defense with </span><span>Dragonfang</span><span> and end this once and for all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was certain this combination would be too much for Mordred to handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he was right&mdash;or so he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in all his calculations, Anthony had forgotten one crucial detail&mdash;Blood Shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Anthony could react, a massive figure rose from the crimson mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mordred's body grew rapidly, transforming in the blink of an eye into a thirty-foot monstrosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face twisted into something inhuman&mdash;blue skin, protruding fangs, and features so grotesque they defied description.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his hideous appearance, the creature radiated a sense of pure killing intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was charging forward with </span><span>Dragonfang</span><span>, committed to finishing Mordred off&mdash;but instead, Mordred's foot caught him square in the chest, sending him flying backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way to dodge. Anthony had been moving too fast, carrying too much momentum forward to change direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mordred's transformation happened in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The kick came fast, though it seemed more intended to push Anthony back than to cause real damage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucky for him&mdash;if Mordred had put his full force behind it, that single blow could have taken Anthony out of the fight completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony had already witnessed the terrifying power of Blood Shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its combination of raw strength and mystical properties made it practically invincible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when he fought </span><span>Necros</span><span>, Anthony barely managed to hold his own using Dragon Avatar at full power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now</span><span>,</span><span> Mordred was clearly stronger than </span><span>Necros</span><span> had ever been, which meant his defensive capabilities would be even more formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To make matters worse, Anthony couldn't maintain Dragon Avatar for much longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And even with it, he probably wouldn't stand a chance against Mordred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This dark magic was beyond anything he'd expected. At his current level, Anthony was completely outmatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap in their powers was massive. Mordred was fighting at Level C Warrior, maybe even Metahuman level, while Anthony was stuck at Level B.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was only one way he could hope to defeat Mordred. He needed to break through his limits once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Devil Eye would have to evolve one more time. If he could upgrade it to version 3.0, the new powers it would grant might give him a fighting chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony knew that with enough power to break through to Level C Warrior and Metahuman status, he could take down the seemingly invincible Mordred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was a catch&mdash;breaking through wasn't simple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each time Anthony had reached a new </span><span>level,</span><span> it had been directly tied to the Chosen Path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To advance now, he'd need to complete the project's third phase&mdash;finding the </span><span>Leyline</span><span>. The problem was</span><span> that</span><span> nobody knew its exact location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd asked Arthur about it before, but Vincent had been careful to keep the </span><span>Leyline's</span><span> location a closely guarded secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Virstino</span><span> Mountains stretched for hundreds of miles, and even though Anthony knew the </span><span>Leyline</span><span> was somewhere in the Turner family mines within those mountains, finding it while being hunted by Mordred seemed like an impossible dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony gasped in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my God! Aunt Carolyn, what... what is that thing?" Rose's voice trembled as she stared in disbelief, her whole body shaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They watched in horror as a normal person transformed before their eyes into a thirty-foot monster. Rose had seen many strange things in her life, but nothing had prepared her for this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn drew in a sharp breath, her face paling. "This... this has to be dark magic. Incredibly powerful dark magic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It looks like he's been enhanced with Metahuman abilities," she continued, shaking her head in disbelief. "But that doesn't make any sense. Mordred is clearly a Warrior. How could he possibly have merged Metahuman powers with dark magic? It should be impossible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was clearly baffled by this unprecedented combination of abilities, having never encountered anything like it before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet</span><span>,</span><span> unlike Rose, who was trembling with fear, Carolyn maintained her composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sharing her quick assessment, she clenched her fists and reached deep within herself, trying to tap into her remaining power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The effects of the medicine were wearing off, and she had to find a way. Anthony needed her help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Against a monster like this, even someone as strong as Anthony didn't stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of breaking bones echoed through the air as Mordred moved like a ghost, closing the distance in an instant. His </span><span>fist</span><span> crashed into Anthony, sending him flying, only to follow up with a brutal kick before Anthony could recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was completely outmatched. In Mordred's hands, he might as well have been </span><span>a ragdoll&mdash;one moment thrown through the air like a discarded toy </span><span>and </span><span>the next slammed into the ground with bone-crushing force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of brutal impacts echoed through the air without pause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thank </span><span>god</span><span> for Anthony's Dragon Avatar. A normal human body would've been pulverized by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But even with the Dragon Avatar's protection, how much longer could he hold out? If he couldn't break free soon, death was inevitable.</span></p></div>
