        <h1>Chapter 62 Welcoming Ms. Ronald</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin played his final card, demanding a face-to-face confrontation with the werewolf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew this move would put him in an unassailable position. After all, there was no chance the werewolf would show up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, he believed that Anthony would never be able to capture the werewolf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Second, even if the werewolf were captured, according to the rules of the Evil Spirit Legion and the werewolf's nature, they would never surrender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they failed and were caught, the werewolf would rather die than betray the organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This loyalty was precisely why the Evil Spirit Legion was so trusted by its clients.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without the werewolf's testimony, no matter how much Anthony accused him or how suspicious Carolyn remained, Calvin was confident he'd walk away unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Carolyn frowned deeply, her gaze filled with unease as she looked at Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was 80% certain Calvin was guilty, but without concrete evidence, she couldn't make a compelling case before so many onlookers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent, glaring menacingly at Anthony, growled, "If you're so sure, bring the werewolf here for a confrontation! If the werewolf identifies Calvin, I won't shield him. But if you fail, don't blame me for what happens next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll execute you on the spot for slander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony checked the time, then smiled faintly. "Since you won't believe it until you see it, I'll settle this once and for all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled out his phone, made a call, and then leaned back with a relieved expression. "In ten minutes, the werewolf will appear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Meanwhile, I could use a drink. Rose, would you care to join me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his calm demeanor, his smile betrayed exhaustion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony had been under immense pressure, gambling from the very beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bet that the mastermind was someone within the Turner family and, more critically, that Jane wouldn't fail in capturing the werewolf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The phone call confirmed Jane's success, allowing Anthony to finally exhale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The earlier battle with Dariel and the oppressive aura from Carolyn had drained him completely. Until the situation was resolved, he had forced himself to stay upright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with the tension easing, a wave of fatigue washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His legs felt heavy, and all he wanted was to collapse into a soft chair, or better yet, a bed, and drift into a deep sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his sudden pallor, Rose was startled but quickly understood his intention from the look in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course," she said warmly. "You're my savior and a guest of honor. I'd be delighted to toast you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking his hand, she led him toward the head table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop right there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, what game are you playing? Explain yourself now, or I'll kill you where you stand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent blocked their path, seething with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony chuckled. "Mr. Vincent Turner, I said the werewolf would arrive in ten minutes. Can't you even wait that long?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're stalling for time!" Vincent spat. "And if you fail to produce the werewolf in ten minutes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I'll deserve to die," Anthony replied coolly. "Consider this a parting drink for my journey to the afterlife. Does that satisfy you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent gritted his teeth. "Fine! You said it yourself! Everyone here is a witness. If you can't deliver the werewolf in ten minutes, you die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin stepped forward, shouting, "We all heard it! Mr. Vincent Turner, don't worry. We'll testify to this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne chimed in eagerly, "Exactly! Anthony, ten minutes from now, prepare to meet your end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest of the crowd also began shouting in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their view, not to mention ten minutes, even a day, or a year, Anthony would never be able to identify the werewolf killer, let alone directly accuse Calvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Anthony, he no longer cared. He sat down beside Rose, holding her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did Rose not let go of his hand, but she tightened her grip. At the same time, a pure energy flowed from her palm into Anthony's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Anthony felt a jolt of mental clarity, as if someone suffering from altitude sickness had suddenly entered a forest oxygen bar or like a desert traveler who had just arrived at a freshwater lake. His dry, weary body and soul seemed to be bathed in a gentle spring breeze and soft rain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose was using her healing superpower to replenish his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The comfort was intoxicating, like a fine wine warming his spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time passed, Anthony's energy was rapidly recovering. Meanwhile, as the countdown approached ten minutes, Calvin and Vincent grew increasingly excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent silently gathered power, ready to strike the moment ten minutes were up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wouldn't give Anthony a chance to defend himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time's up! Mr. Vincent Turner, act now!" Calvin shouted excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a roar, Vincent lunged toward Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dragon Guild's Yoland branch director, Jane, has arrived with a grand gift to congratulate Ms. Turner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The announcement reverberated through Turner Manor, sending a shockwave through everyone's hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane herself was here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though her status in Yoland didn't surpass Carolyn's, she represented the Dragon Guild, which was a core enterprise under the Godfather's domain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was someone from the Godfather's circle, and that alone was enough to overshadow Yoland, making everyone give her some respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's eyebrows rose in surprise but quickly smoothed as she called out warmly, "Welcome, Ms. Ronald!"</span></p></div>
