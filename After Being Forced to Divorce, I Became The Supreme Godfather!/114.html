        <h1>Chapter 113 Tensions Rising</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Arthur and his group left, Anthony quickly made his way back to the Turner family Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The estate was still surrounded by several werewolves, and Anthony knew he couldn't afford to be careless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Roar&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, Anthony let out a roar that shook the very foundations of the land, echoing far and wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Turner Manor, the standoff continued. Anne was torn, unsure whether to act or </span><span>wait and watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the more she thought about it, the more unwilling she was to sit idly by. The Turner family had already been drained of all their resources, and even if the werewolf leader, Mason Foster, hadn't come yet, the current werewolf army was more than enough to wipe them out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Mason wasn't a match for Anthony, what did that matter?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time Anthony returned, the Turner family would have already been reduced to rubble!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would Anthony dare kill her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the Turner family was destroyed, Anne would easily rise to power and become the ruler of Yoland, and Anthony would be nothing in comparison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh!" she muttered, her lips curling in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What balanced forces? What confidence?" she snapped angrily at Dariel. "He's nothing but a reckless fool relying on drugs. What kind of confidence does he even have? Why would we believe in his equal strength?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't forget, Mr. Foster brought you here to destroy the Turner family!" she continued, her voice rising.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now we have the perfect opportunity, so why hesitate?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Destroying the Turner family is not something we're doing on our own initiative&mdash;it's our mission!" she declared, her eyes flashing with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't waste any more time! Move now, and eradicate the Turners!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Foster will reward us handsomely when he returns!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolf army, already uncertain, was swayed by Anne's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she had said, their mission was clear: they were here to annihilate the Turner family, whether or not Mason was present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could they consider it insubordination when they were merely following orders?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dammit..." Dariel muttered under his breath, his fury building as he saw Anne's insistence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!" he shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut your mouth!" Anne barked, cutting him off. "Don't speak nonsense when your death is imminent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Turner family is finished! Wiping them out will be easy&mdash;now is the time to strike!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Howl&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Anne's command, the werewolf army let out a collective howl that echoed in the night air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Werewolves from all sides emerged from their hiding spots, baring their fangs as they prepared to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family felt a chill run down their spines, and Dariel instinctively took a step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, there was no more room for negotiation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolves would not listen to him; they would follow Anne instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guys!" Dariel shouted, standing at the forefront of his group. "Prepare to face the enemy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolf army, now within three hundred feet of the Turner Manor, braced themselves for the inevitable confrontation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle was on the brink of erupting!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a group of foolish werewolves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as both sides were at a tense standoff, a commanding voice echoed from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone turned toward the source of the voice and saw Rose, dressed in a flowing purple gown, walking toward them, radiant as ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With graceful steps and an enchanting presence, she moved like a vision, her every gesture dazzling as if she were a beam of light, catching everyone's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst the ruins, Rose moved steadily forward, her gaze briefly scanning Anne before she addressed the werewolf army, her tone resolute. "Not to mention, before Mr. Foster left, he clearly stated that we would settle this with a one-on-one duel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anne? What is she even?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A home-wrecking woman, who cheated during her marriage&mdash;what right does she have to command you? She speaks a few words, and you let her sway you into acting on your own?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although I'm not familiar with the Evil Spirit Legion, I know one thing: in any organization, defying orders and acting without command is a grave offense. Aren't you afraid of punishment?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Rose's gaze turned colder, her eyes gleaming with a dangerous intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the gaze of the crowd, Rose appeared like a goddess descending from the heavens, her every word ringing out, striking fear into the hearts of all who heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolves froze, and even members of the Turner family&mdash;Carolyn, Jane, and Dariel&mdash;could only stare, stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose Turner?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something about her was different, but what exactly?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh!" Anne, furious, retorted, "Acting without command? This is clearly an opportunity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't listen to her. She's from the Turner family, of course, she's going to speak in their favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And so what if it's a duel?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you honestly believe Mr. Foster isn't a match for Anthony?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony is a worthless fool relying on drugs&mdash;how could he possibly be a threat to Mr. Foster?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Turner family is finished, and Mr. Foster has lured Anthony away to buy you all the time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the greatest opportunity you'll ever get&mdash;don't you see it? Why are you still hesitating? Attack now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some reason, seeing Rose so radiant and powerful, exuding such an intense aura, made Anne feel uneasy, causing her to panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hah!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Turner family is finished?" Rose turned her gaze toward Anne. "Anne, have you lost your mind because of Alvin? Are you contradicting yourself in front of everyone?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First you say I'm from the Turner family, then you say the Turner family is finished?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to fight?" Anne's temper flared as she coldly laughed. "Yes, You are from the Turner family, but so what?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone in Yoland knows you're just a sickly weakling. What can you fight or win?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you're a healer, so what? Can you save just one person, or a hundred? Now that the Turner family is on the brink of collapse, how many people can you really save with your powers?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't tell me your healing power can save everyone!"</span></p></div>
