        <h1>Chapter 130 Best to Be Prepared</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrival of the Evil Spirit Legion was all within Anthony's expectations!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's attitude puzzled Carolyn and Rose, leaving everyone else bewildered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't seem worried at all; in fact, he appeared somewhat excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had this guy really gone bonkers from excessive drug use?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne and the others weren't the only ones who believed Anthony's powers stemmed from drugs; some Turner family members shared the same sentiment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, this was mainly because Anthony himself had admitted to being a test subject at the Godfather Research Institute, so he had no one to blame but himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of answering their questions, Anthony changed the subject and asked, "Aunt Carolyn, how much of the Turner family's security force has been restored?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"About a third," Carolyn replied, letting go of her previous concerns when she saw Anthony shifting the topic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She trusted that Anthony's confidence meant he had something up his sleeve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he didn't want to discuss it, she wouldn't press the matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family's security forces had taken a massive hit in the previous battle, losing two-thirds of their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such losses wouldn't be easy to recover from anytime soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony wasn't surprised at all. "Here's an idea," he said. "Just to be safe, I think Aunt Carolyn should hire some outside help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's this security company, Draconic Shield, that's been making a name for itself lately. They seem pretty capable. Might be worth a shot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Draconic Shield?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn paused, then smiled. "Actually, I know a little about them. They're led by twelve people who call themselves the Zodiac.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And each one is incredibly skilled. They've taken the city by storm. They're definitely the real deal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony smiled with satisfaction. "No matter what, since the Evil Spirit Legion won't let things go, it's best to be prepared and hire some extra help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," Carolyn agreed, then called out the door, "Dariel, come in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel strode in from outside, nodding respectfully to Anthony before turning to Carolyn with a bow. "Ms. Turner, what are your orders?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get in touch with Draconic Shield. Hire enough of their people to patch up the holes in the Turner family's defenses."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Ms. Carolyn Turner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel bowed and accepted the mission without unnecessary questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As head of security, he knew better than anyone the current state of the Turner family's defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's actions weren't just about drumming up business for Draconic Shield. He was building their reputation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Dariel was about to leave, Anthony called out to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After studying him for a moment, he asked, "You're about to break through, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel was clearly startled by the question and then nodded. "Yes, how did you know, Mr. Johnson?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How did Anthony know?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truth was, he didn't. He'd just happened to scan Dariel's power levels with Devil Eye on a whim, and it had alerted him to Dariel's imminent breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, Anthony wasn't about to reveal anything about Devil Eye. Instead, he kept them guessing and said, "Come find me after you're done with your tasks. I can help you with your breakthrough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you so much, Mr. Johnson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's words took Dariel entirely by surprise. He nodded respectfully, his eyes wide with a mix of disbelief and hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene stunned everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear Dariel was on the verge of a breakthrough, but to claim he could help him achieve it...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was something else entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of astonishment rippled through the group. Rose and Carolyn exchanged glances, surprise evident in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, unlike the others who were filled with doubt, they silently chose to believe Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't explain it, but they had a feeling that if Anthony said he could do it, he could. It was an almost unconditional trust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, Dariel's power level had been somewhere between Level A and Level B.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After his life-or-death battle with the Turner family, it made sense that Dariel would experience a breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, being able to spot someone's impending breakthrough at a glance was hard to swallow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of this, many members of the Turner family dropped their dismissive attitudes when they looked at Anthony again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Anthony seemed so confident about the Smith family situation, Carolyn decided to hold her tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her concerns, she let the others leave first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Anthony and Rose were the only ones left, Carolyn still expressed her concerns for Anthony and the Turner family's determination to protect him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Anthony once again declined their offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he asked about the Mines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Rose had said, Carolyn didn't know what secrets the Mines held either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Carolyn and Rose had different opinions about Vincent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or rather, Carolyn's view aligned with Anthony's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent couldn't be trusted!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keeping Vincent at the Turner family Mines wasn't a wise move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the mines held no secrets, that would be one thing. But if they did, Vincent would stop at nothing to claim them for himself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Vincent's presence at the mines posed a potential threat to the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was direct about it. "In that case, we should nip this problem in the bud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll make a trip to the mines in a few days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony knew he had to go to the Mines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would be ideal if someone from the Turner family could accompany him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn nodded in agreement. "We definitely need to check it out, but for now, we should focus on what the Smith family is up to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the Evil Spirit Legion is dead set on targeting you, we can't let our guard down..."</span></p></div>
