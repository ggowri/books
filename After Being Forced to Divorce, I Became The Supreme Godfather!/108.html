        <h1>Chapter 107 Luring Them Away</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could Mason be employing a strategy of luring them away?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't out of the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family had suffered heavy losses in this battle, and the werewolf army </span><span>hadn't come out unscathed either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, Anthony's relentless barrage had left the werewolf army with no room to retaliate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that had continued, the werewolves would have been defeated, and with Anthony gone...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Dariel thought about it, the more fearful he became. His anger flared, and he immediately shifted into a combat-ready stance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn and Jane exchanged glances, both their faces darkening with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't just stand there. If you can't even fathom Mr. Foster's intentions, do you even deserve to be his confidants?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne chided, feigning anger, "If you really sit on your hands, you'll be the absolute fools. Mr. Foster will be furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I were you, I'd seize this chance to wipe out the Turner family and wait for Mr. Foster to reward me upon his return."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Anne berating the werewolf army so sternly, Alvin pondered for a moment, then shouted, "Right! Why haven't you acted yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not satisfied, he added, "Mr. Foster has accepted our allegiance, and the future of Yoland will undoubtedly be under our control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I command you to attack now and annihilate the Turner family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alvin strode forward, waving his hand towards the werewolf army, adopting a posture as if leading a formidable force to crush the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spurred by Anne and Alvin's incitement, the werewolf army could no longer remain seated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leading werewolves immediately howled to the sky, and the werewolf army began to assemble rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the distance, another round of thunderous sounds echoed, accompanied by the faint, miserable howls of wolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The noises were coming from the direction of Phantom Hollow, where dust was billowing, and the earth seemed to shake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many were filled with trepidation. The battle between Anthony and Mason seemed to be of significant consequence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel suddenly burst into laughter, saying, "Mr. Johnson is doomed? I think not. This battle is earth-shattering, suggesting an evenly matched contest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Johnson is not reckless. Since he dared to agree to face Mason in Phantom Hollow, he must have complete confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In my opinion, your leader is no match for Mr. Johnson. If you dare to act on your own, Mr. Johnson will not spare you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The assembling werewolf army once again halted, caught in a dilemma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason had promised a decisive duel with Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, they were engaged in a fierce battle in Phantom Hollow, with the outcome still uncertain. Attacking now seemed unwise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, after such an extended ceasefire, the Turner family had regained some of its strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Mason, it was uncertain who would prevail if they were to engage in battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they stood at an impasse, another thunderous crash came from Phantom Hollow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this time, Mason's howl was more distinct.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's heart skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "The werewolf army is surprisingly so cautious. No way, right? Could Mason really not be Anthony's match? How could that be? But what if he isn't? If Anthony kills Mason, that would be trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If we don't wipe out the Turner family, there's still room for redemption. If the Turner family is destroyed and Mason is dead, Anthony will kill me. Rather than take such a risk, I'd better wait. Mr. Foster will surely come back to eliminate the Turner family after killing Anthony. I don't need to rush."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this thought, Anne stopped instigating the werewolf army and decided to wait and see how things unfolded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Anthony won, the Evil Spirit Legion would not let it go easily. They would eventually kill him and destroy the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just needed to wait patiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Anthony died, Mason would surely also destroy the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what happened, she wouldn't lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a shady ravine of Phantom Hollow, dust and rocks were flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony sent Mason flying with another punch, saying, "I told you, you're no match for me. If you reveal the true intentions behind the attack on the Turner family, I might consider letting you die quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How arrogant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason, though disheveled, remained defiant. He roared, "You will die miserably today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He howled to the sky, dropped to all fours, and transformed into a massive wolf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, he leaped into the air, a giant wolf's paw emerging from his black robe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stubborn to the end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's eyes darkened, and he said, "So be it, don't blame me for showing no mercy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he met Mason's attack with lightning speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had held back in the previous rounds, aiming to probe the true intentions behind the werewolf attack on the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Mason, loyal to the core, had not revealed any information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After several rounds, Anthony had lost his patience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprisingly, as Anthony punched towards Mason's attack, a cold, gleaming blade stabbed out from his wolf's paw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hidden blade in the black robe stabbed out unexpectedly, catching Anthony off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think such petty tricks can deal with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with such a move, Anthony merely sneered.</span></p></div>
