        <h1>Chapter 92 Heal</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne was in a state of madness, barely able to contain her excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family was going to be devastated!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rise of the Smith family would be unstoppable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, who was engaged in a fierce battle with Mason, couldn't help but be startled when he heard that the south gate had been breached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also immediately thought of Dariel, unable to believe that even a Level A Metahuman had failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but start worrying about Carolyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he was distracted, Mason seized the opportunity and kicked Anthony in the chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force of this kick was so great that it made Anthony, who was caught off guard, spit out blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was kicked away like a broken puppet and then slammed into the wall with such force that he broke through it, flying into the courtyard of the Turner Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony..." Rose's face was filled with panic, her cry laced with an unmistakable sob. Ignoring Helen's attempts to stop her, she hurried over and helped Anthony up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony tried to speak but spat out another mouthful of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Devil Eye had dissipated, and the power of the Leopard Avatar quickly faded away as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's face visibly paled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this battle, he had given it his all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the gap in strength was like an insurmountable chasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He only regretted that the Devil Eye had failed to evolve!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the battle, Anthony desperately hoped that the Devil Eye could evolve once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To achieve this, Anthony even risked multiple times on purpose to force the Devil Eye to evolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Devil Eye could break through its power bottleneck, then Anthony had full confidence that he could easily kill Mason!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, all these efforts were in vain!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After his desperate battle, the Devil Eye's power was exhausted; not only did it fail to evolve, but it also fell into a state of dormancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Anthony was filled with regret, a sudden surge of warmth erupted from Rose's palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surge of warmth flowed through Anthony's palm, rapidly spreading to his limbs and even every blood vessel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose's healing superpower was quickly restoring Anthony's strength and healing his wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As an orthodox Metahuman, her power was incredibly strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Anthony's exhausted body, drained from exertion, felt as if it were being rejuvenated by a gentle rain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the nourishment of the healing power, he felt like a fish on the brink of death from thirst, now returned to the vast ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He threw himself into absorbing this power with reckless abandon, greedily and frantically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, no one noticed that Mason, instead of taking the opportunity to attack, had quietly retreated a few hundred feet away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the battle just now, Anthony fought with all his might. Despite the astonishing gap in strength between them, he managed to slash a few cuts on Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The injuries were not fatal, but they significantly reduced his combat effectiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Werewolves, attack!" After retreating to a large rock, Mason sat down and loudly commanded his subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for his injuries, Mason's wounds were not severe; he still had the strength for another fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, with his army now arrived, there was no need for him to risk everything to take down the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hundred werewolves were enough to smash the Turner Manor into dust!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, this battle had dragged on for too long. Outsiders might not know the details, but he was very clear that it could not be prolonged any further!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It must be a quick battle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his command, a deafening howl rose, and over a hundred werewolves advanced together, their footsteps a dull rumble that thundered in the ears. Dust from the ground was stirred up, as if a sandstorm were approaching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolves surged forward like towering waves of the sea, roaring towards the Turner Manor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brothers! Prepare to defend!" The wolf pack was charging fiercely, but the Turner Guards were not at all afraid of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their resolute roars and shouts shook the earth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of morale, they were in no way inferior to the werewolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the Turner Guards were even more resolute!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolves surged forward, and in the moment the battle erupted, the Turner Guards pulled the triggers from atop the high walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A torrent of bullets, like a raging storm, rained down on the werewolves in a frenzied barrage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the werewolves had thick skin and extremely strong defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ordinary ammunition was completely insufficient to pose a lethal threat to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the immense force of the impact significantly slowed the werewolves' march.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, small shells exploded amidst the ranks of the werewolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of the shells was no laughing matter!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolf army suffered countless casualties in an instant, with cries of agony echoing everywhere. The werewolves at the center of the explosions were directly blown to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the werewolves slightly farther from the explosion's center did not die. They were either knocked over or suffered limb injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was more frightening was that the werewolves, despite losing limbs, remained ferocious. Not only did they not fear the shells, but they charged forward even more fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They seemed like a group of mindless, pain-insensitive, death-defying zombies!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene was bone-chilling!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They completely disregarded their own lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, in no time at all, the werewolves broke through the barrage of gunfire and pounced on the Turner Guards!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of the hundreds of werewolves, only twenty to thirty had been killed. The remaining dozens, with their fierce combat power and suicidal fighting style, were difficult for the Turner Guards to hold back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold them back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this critical moment, they had no choice but to defend the Turner Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turner Guards resolutely charged towards the army of werewolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This battle concerned the survival of the Turner family. No one retreated or feared death!</span></p></div>
