        <h1>Chapter 38 The Evil Spirit Legion</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the machine whirred to life, lines of data began to flash across the computer screen beside it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first batch of data detailed the werewolf's basic information: height, weight, blood type, and more. But what followed was far more alarming: an in-depth analysis of its speed, strength, and skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony stared at the numbers, a chill running down his spine. It was a miracle he had come out of that fight alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to Rose's selfless assistance, Devil Eye had been restored just in time, allowing him to defeat the creature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for that, he would've been torn to shreds by this beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Level A, the most basic of beast metahumans. This one was juiced up with drugs. Judging by the chemical signatures, he's part of the Evil Spirit Legion, a group responsible for countless atrocities. I won't lose any sleep draining his blood and extracting his essence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph mumbled to herself as she examined the data. She pressed a button, and the machine began to draw blood from the werewolf's corpse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony watched with wide eyes as the werewolf's body visibly shrank, its once-fearsome frame turning into something pale and mummified right before his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph then pressed another button to extract the bone marrow. The corpse, already drained of blood, now had its marrow sucked dry, leaving it even more desiccated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pressed a third button: purification.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood and marrow in the tubes began to bubble and churn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What exactly are you trying to do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't this a bit cruel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph peeled off her white gloves and lab coat, revealing the sexy, curvaceous figure she usually sported. She flashed a sultry smile at Anthony, "Relax. The purification process takes about thirty minutes. How about we grab a drink in the meantime? I'll explain everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She led him through a door into a completely different environment. Gone was the sterile, cold lab. They were now in a dimly lit, cozy bar. The soft glow of the lights swayed gently, and soothing music flowed like a mountain spring. The shelves were lined with bottles of the finest wines from all over the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's your pleasure?" Her fingers danced across the bottles before finally settling on a bottle of vodka. "After what you've been through, a strong drink will do you </span><span>good. Something to calm the nerves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She poured two glasses and leaned forward, resting on the coffee table in front of Anthony. She handed him a glass, her voice dripping with innuendo, "Cheers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony clinked his glass against hers and took a generous gulp. The fiery liquid burned its way down his throat, igniting a spark of boldness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at the seductive Seraph before him and smirked. "A man and a woman, alone in a room. You give me strong liquor to drink. Aren't you afraid I might get drunk and try something?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph took a delicate sip, her finger playfully tapping his forehead. "If you can overpower me, you can do whatever you like. But, kiddo, you're too weak."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiddo? Too weak?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flame ignited in Anthony's eyes. In a swift motion, he grabbed Seraph and pinned her down on the sofa. His face hovered inches from hers as he clenched his teeth in mock fury. "Maybe I'll shag you now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His pulse was still racing from the recent brush with death, and now this woman was pushing his limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tore at her clothes, eyes locking onto the naked, alluring body beneath. A fire burned in his chest, and he lunged, a low growl escaping his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the moment his hands touched her skin, sharp thorns erupted from her flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spikes, though soft to the touch, were as painful as needles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony yelped and recoiled, clutching his hands. The woman beneath him, now covered in dangerous-looking thorns, looked like a seductive rose that was as deadly as she was beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph stretched leisurely. "How can you expect to have your way to fuck me if you can't even get my clothes off?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, Mr. Johnson, please sit down and let me explain what's going on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, feeling both frustrated and his ego a bit bruised, muttered with a huff, "Sooner or later, I'll strip you down and have you begging for mercy beneath me! Get dressed! You're too damn hot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bionic suit was astonishing in its design; when not activated, it made Seraph appear completely nude, utterly bare. It was enough to turn men on upon seeing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph was evidently quite pleased with her physique. She slipped into a coat, finally appearing less exposed, though her allure was hardly diminished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony tried to calm his racing heart. "Just tell me what's going on with the werewolf and this Evil Spirit Legion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph replied, "The Evil Spirit Legion is the oldest and most mysterious assassin organization in all of Velmor. Unlike the regular assassins hunting you, every member of the Evil Spirit Legion is a metahuman. Some are born to be metahumans, while others, like the werewolf you fought, are enhanced through special drugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But whether naturally awakened or chemically enhanced, they all sign a soul contract. Once they join, they cannot leave the organization until death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With this kind of unwavering loyalty and the prowess of their members, they can easily be called the most terrifying assassin organization in Velmor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Many high-level warriors and metahumans from powerful families are bound to meet </span><span>their end if these assassins set their sights on them. Of course, their fees are terrifyingly steep, and they have strict criteria for who can employ them. Common folk just don't make the cut to even consider hiring them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony nodded in understanding and remarked, "So, they're not after me; they're here to kill Rose. Whoever hired them must be a major player!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph nodded. "That seems to be the case. They blended in with the regular killers after you, which was a perfect cover for their true identities and intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Johnson, are you in love with Rose?"</span></p></div>
