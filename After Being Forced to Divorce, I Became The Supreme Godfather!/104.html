        <h1>Chapter 103 The Final Charge</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst the ruins, Mason stood proudly, sneering, "Carolyn, what tricks does your Turner family have left?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For the sake of an ignorant man, the Turner family has come to such an end. Was it worth it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Turner family has been ruined for him, yet he ran away like a coward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How laughable! Men, attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason laughed loudly, raising his arm in a rallying cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been long enough. He didn't want to delay any further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Mason's command, the werewolf army howled in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The piercing howls sounded the battle's call, and the werewolf army launched their final charge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at that very moment, a series of intense, muffled, and extremely dense gunfire erupted like war drums and thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the midst of the gunfire, the werewolves at the front of the charge didn't even know what was happening before their robust bodies directly turned into blood mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood mist exploded in all directions, like beautiful roses, each representing the death of a werewolf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolves in the rear, caught off guard, still howled and charged forward desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cost of the charge was undoubtedly death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bullets came like a storm, dense and mighty. Touching them meant certain death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Where the bullets struck, werewolves were all turned into shattered flesh, scattered everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! Who is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After witnessing a round of crazy shooting, Mason was shocked and ordered, "Retreat! Retreat right now! Find cover! Hide quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With such a shout, the werewolf army finally came to their senses, howling as they sought cover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The firepower was too strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolves' defensive power was extreme, and ordinary bullets and shells hardly threatened them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least, the various gun and artillery defenses of the Turner family and their full firepower had not been able to stop the werewolf army before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was because the power was not strong enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless they were precisely hit, werewolves would only suffer minor injuries, not fatal at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time was different. They didn't know what kind of weapon had such astonishing power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each bullet seemed like a shell, easily breaking through the werewolves' defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the rapid impact would tear their bodies apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With such power, once hit, they had no chance of survival. How could the werewolves not be afraid?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the werewolf army retreat, the warriors of the Turner family were also confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked towards the gunfire and saw sparks flying amidst a pile of ruins. The fire from the bullets flashed continuously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the flickering light, a bare-chested figure could be vaguely seen, as dazzling as a deity descending.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Johnson?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Johnson! It's Mr. Johnson coming..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Johnson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gunfire subsided. Seeing it was Anthony, everyone was in an uproar, stunned and simultaneously overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bullets continued to shoot furiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bare-chested Anthony looked as mighty and formidable as Rambo. With the vibration of the machine gun in his hands, his bulging muscles couldn't help but tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held the machine gun and fired in all directions, intimidating hundreds of werewolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Johnson..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far away, Carolyn looked up at Anthony in shock. Her eyes held admiration and an inexplicable affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in an instant, Carolyn subconsciously averted her gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Johnson is so handsome... Oh my God! This is what a brave man looks like!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And when Jane saw it was Anthony, her beautiful big eyes immediately lit up. She </span><span>couldn't help but exclaim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gazed at Anthony in a trance as if she wanted to pounce on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow! Anthony is so mighty!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, in the bedroom of the safe house, Rose sat weakly on the bed, her naked body covered by a thin gauze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the passionate intimacy, Anthony was as lively as ever, but Rose's legs were weak, her whole body powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The soft, big bed was tossed into a mess with a glaring red mark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A large area of water stains made her particularly shy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bedsheet was almost half-soaked, and she didn't know why. In short, there was a lot of water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose blushed, moved her delicate body, and planned to clean up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she shuddered all over and gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Rose screamed, and the bedsheet slipped from her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She collapsed naked on the bed, her whole body drenched in sweat, with mist rising.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner? What' happened? Ms. Turner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen rushed in from outside, hurriedly covering her with a blanket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some reason, the rising mist quickly soaked through the blanket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen screamed in fright and hurriedly lifted the blanket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon closer inspection, the dense mist was gushing out of Rose's smooth skin pores, strange and terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner! Don't scare me, Ms. Turner! Mr. Johnson! Mr. Johnson, something's wrong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a panic, Helen screamed and was about to rush out to call Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Rose held her back, weakly saying, "No, it's okay. I'm fine... I think I'm about to arouse my superpower."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Superpower?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen looked at Rose in surprise. At this moment, the steaming mist had already melted the blanket she had just covered. Rose's delicate body became transparent, looking as if she was a goddess nurtured from water.</span></p></div>
