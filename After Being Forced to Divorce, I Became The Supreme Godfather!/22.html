        <h1>Chapter 22 A Heart Ailment</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony thought, "So, that's what it is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing the explanation from Devil Eye, Anthony felt a surge of excitement in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The 1.0 version of Devil Eye hadn't just enhanced his body to be as strong as a tiger and as agile as a cheetah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those were only superficial changes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The real transformation was that his physical constitution had been altered to become a "Solar Avatar"!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder, when he held Rose earlier, it felt as though he was embracing a fragrant ice flower on a sweltering summer day. It was comfortable, soothing, and impossible to let go of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His constitution and Rose's were complimentary!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This revelation gave him a newfound confidence. He now felt more certain that he could win Rose's heart and become her true companion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose's cheeks flushed, and though she appeared calm on the outside, inside, she was flustered and embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't believe that because of just one sentence from Anthony, she had embraced this stranger, someone she had just met, in front of so many people!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected herself to become so bold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she felt a twinge of regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at the same time, she found herself reminiscing about the warmth of Anthony's embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never felt so surrounded by warmth before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Anthony's arms, she felt herself relax completely, as though a wandering boat had finally docked in a peaceful harbor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unconsciously, she glanced at him from the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's sharp brows and bright eyes radiated a distinct masculinity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He really is handsome."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but marvel inwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After returning to the exclusive villa lounge set up by Dragon Guild for Rose, a diamond member, she immediately opened up to Anthony. They sat together, and she began telling him everything she found interesting, starting from her childhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony listened intently. He realized that Rose, the most noble girl in everyone's eyes, might appear poised and composed on the surface, but deep down, she was like an innocent little girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once she finished, Rose, curious, asked about Anthony's background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony began to share his story. He had been a street urchin since he could remember, fighting wild dogs for scraps of food. Eventually, he had been taken in by kind-hearted strangers and spent his childhood in an orphanage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose felt sorry for him, and tears welled up in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when Anthony spoke about catching fish in streams, grabbing crabs, climbing trees for bird eggs, and running wild in the fields with his friends, Rose couldn't help but feel a deep envy. She had never known that kind of life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're as free as the wind. If I could live just one day like that, I'd die happy," she said, her voice full of wistfulness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen was growing frustrated. "Ms. Turner, what are you saying? You're perfect: beautiful, talented, everything! Everyone would envy you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner, you need to rest. You can't chat with this guy anymore! Do you realize that today, you've talked to him more than you have in the last ten years?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen's voice was tinged with jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose playfully made a face and said, "I like talking! I'm going to keep talking!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, Anthony, is there anything you want to do or buy while you're here? I can help you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony shook his head. "I came here just to make some money. You've already helped me achieve that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose laughed. "So, you're short on cash? I've got more than enough. I'll transfer thirty million dollars to you right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony hurriedly responded, "No, no! We agreed I'd accompany you for three days. We can settle payment at the end of the contract."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose smiled again. "Tomorrow is the auction. There will be all sorts of strange and rare things. Maybe there's something you like, and you can bid on it with these money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, thirty million dollars was transferred into Anthony's account.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The money came so easily!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a moment ago, he had been a penniless man with only three thousand dollars to his name, and now, in the blink of an eye, he was a millionaire with thirty million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this money, he could buy many M9 Micro Submachine Guns and endless rounds of ammunition from the Dragon Ring Store.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he left Dragon Guild and lost his protection, and even if he was pursued by a hundred killers, he would be able to protect himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen, seeing that Rose needed rest, gave Anthony a pointed look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony quickly said, "It's getting late. You should go rest. I'll go with you to the auction tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then, see you tomorrow!" Rose had only just met Anthony, but she was already a bit reluctant to part.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, her body was frail, and after such an exciting day, she was tired. So, she got up and headed to her bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony turned to Helen and asked, "Ms. Turner doesn't seem to be in the best of health. Isn't the Turner family known for its medical expertise? Why hasn't she been </span><span>properly cared for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen's expression turned sorrowful. "It's complicated. Ms. Turner's illness is a heart ailment, one she's had since birth. Sigh, I only hope that tomorrow we can find a valuable elixir at the auction to cure her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally understood why Rose had come here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was searching for a cure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He silently vowed to help Rose achieve her goal at the auction tomorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To ensure he would be in the best condition to face the challenges ahead, he sat down and began practicing Energy-absorbing Breathing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the regular member's lounge, a conspiracy was unfolding against Anthony, led by Alvin and Anne.</span></p></div>
