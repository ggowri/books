        <h1>Chapter 161 A Test</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're late." As the crowd approached, the Black Cloak spoke without turning around, his voice sharp with frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne felt a chill run down her spine. After swallowing hard, she hesitantly stepped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After bowing respectfully, she stammered, "Please, </span><span>Archlord</span><span> </span><span>Iscairn</span><span>, forgive us. The mountain roads are treacherous, and we rarely come this way... That's why we were delayed..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne knew how important this mission was, not just for her family but for the future of several prominent families in Yoland. She couldn't afford to fail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she never expected they'd be late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Cloak</span><span> </span><span>let out an irritated snort and then finally turned to face her, scowling. "Because of your delay, </span><span>Archlord</span><span> </span><span>Iscairn</span><span> is displeased... and has already left."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's heart sank. This wasn't Lorcan, but the same messenger who'd delivered a letter to the Smith family before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his words left her shaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like the Evil Spirit Legion might be turning their backs on them now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur, standing among the crowd, furrowed his brow. Something felt off. He couldn't sense his informant nearby, and he wasn't sure if the </span><span>Archlord</span><span> the messenger referred to was the same one he'd been tracking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But one thing was clear. There was no trace of his informant in the area, which made him uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's hesitation, Anne spoke again, her voice trembling with urgency. "Please, Great Envoy, we didn't mean to be late."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please don't be angry. I'm truly dedicated to joining the Evil Spirit Legion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please give me another chance. I will do whatever it takes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She subtly signaled to the others with a glance, and they immediately caught on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir, we've learned our lesson..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We beg for your mercy..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others bowed their heads, pleading with all their might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne still hoped there was a way to make things right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Lorcan had truly left because of their delay, this messenger would have followed. But since he was still here, there must be a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The messenger let out a cold hum but then spoke again, his tone slightly softer. "Fine. Out of consideration for your sincerity, I'll give you another chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or perhaps... a test."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne breathed a sigh of relief. "Thank you! Please tell me what I need to do, and I'll get it done, no matter the cost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The task is simple. In three days, gather all the items on this list and ensure you have enough manpower," the messenger said, still cold as he handed Anne a piece of paper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood," Anne responded, bowing deeply and taking the list with both hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Arthur's mind raced as he moved closer, his eyes narrowing at the list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The items were all related to mining equipment for exploration, drilling, crushing, lifting, and transporting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur was familiar with most of the equipment listed, but he couldn't understand why the Evil Spirit Legion would need them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Envoy. We'll have everything ready in three days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we don't, I'll take full responsibility!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne gave it a quick glance and nodded confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Getting her hands on the equipment would be no problem for the Smith family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, anyone here could probably gather everything in a day or two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You may leave now," the messenger said, waving them off with a dismissive gesture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne blinked, caught off guard. "But... what about Anthony? And the Turner family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony has repeatedly opposed the Evil Spirit Legion, and three days ago, he tried to stop us from joining. He deserves to be punished!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Turner family has protected him on several occasions, and with their influence in Yoland, if the Evil Spirit Legion wants to establish itself here, the Turner family must be dealt with!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne loathed Anthony with every fiber of her being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first moment she had the chance to work with the Evil Spirit Legion, she wanted him gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family, too, was a thorn in her side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as they existed, her family couldn't truly dominate Yoland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The messenger smiled coldly. "Anthony? Just some insignificant fool."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. If we're being honest, the kid's probably dead by now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Anne could respond, Arthur's heart skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The messenger's tone was full of certainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sudden sense of unease washed over </span><span>him</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He instinctively glanced around the canyon. There was no sign of Anthony, and the familiar scent of his presence was completely absent.</span></p></div>
