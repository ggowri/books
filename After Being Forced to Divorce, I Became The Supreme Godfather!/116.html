        <h1>Chapter 115 Long-Awaited Desires</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose's husband?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Part of the Turner family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony Johnson?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne couldn't believe what she was hearing. Her mind was racing, filled with disbelief, confusion, and fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha!" she spat, her teeth clenched. "The Turner family? Oh, how terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Turner family is practically finished! What's the big deal with them? What is there to be proud of in being your husband?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's just trash&mdash;worthless. I don't care about him at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought you were the proud daughter of the Turner family. So pure and untouchable. But now I see you're no better than the rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've known him for how long? And already you're jumping into bed with him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The proud daughter of the Turner family, allowing a useless man to steal your innocence right before his death and then you are flaunting it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not even embarrassed? I'm embarrassed for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne continued her rant, her fury spilling out in every word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Rose could even open her mouth, Dariel's voice boomed. His anger was palpable, and he seethed. "You filthy woman! How dare you speak to Ms. Turner like that? I'll make you regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaped into the air, his strength restored, and in the blink of an eye, he closed the distance, ready to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne gasped in surprise, and shouted toward the werewolf army. "Look, they've recovered their strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you still waiting? Attack now, before it's too late!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we miss this chance, Mr. Foster won't forgive you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Charge! Kill Rose Turner! Destroy the Turner family&mdash;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The howl of the werewolf army echoed in the night as they surged forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the attackers quickly realized that Rose had an incredible power&mdash;the ability to heal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her power was so overwhelming that the members of the Turner family, who were on the verge of death, were recovering in mere moments, their faces returning to their normal color and their breathing stable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this continued, it wouldn't be long before the entire Turner family regained their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And once that happened, not even Mason could defeat them, let alone if he wasn't around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had no time to waste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang! Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the werewolf army was charging, a series of loud gunshots rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bullets were powerful, capable of piercing through multiple werewolves with a single shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any werewolf struck by these bullets would suffer devastating damage&mdash;some limbs severed, others shattered beyond recognition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take cover!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolves panicked, scrambling to find shelter as the bullets continued to rain down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne turned around, and her face went pale when she saw Anthony. He was shirtless, holding an Inferno Gatling, mowing down the werewolves with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne was taken aback. "Anthony? How... how are you still alive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!" she shouted. "You're attacking werewolves&mdash;Mr. Foster won't let you get away with this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the werewolf army scrambled to hide, Anthony lowered his weapon and looked at Anne with a cold smile. "Mr. Foster? What if I told you he's dead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason was dead?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words hung in the air, sending shockwaves through Anne and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The revelation stunned everyone. Some were already turning to look toward the </span><span>distant entrance, searching for any sign of their leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But outside the gates, there was only Anthony&mdash;no one else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's absurd!" Anne snapped, glaring at him. "You're trying to say you killed Mr. Foster? You think we're fools?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smirked. "Since you're still alive, there's only one explanation&mdash;you must have switched sides and joined Mr. Foster, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You came back to convince the Turner family to follow him, didn't you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I bet you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin chimed in with a mocking laugh. "Mr. Foster is invincible. You, a man who relies on drugs to stay alive, could never be his equal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused for effect. "Looks like Mr. Foster, being the magnanimous leader he is, spared your life and sent you back to bring the Turner family to his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now we know we made the right choice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The families from Yoland City had gathered for one reason: to divide the Turner family's assets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, hearing the words from Anne and Alvin, they couldn't contain their excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family had been one of the most powerful families in Yoland City for centuries, and its wealth was an enticing prize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they could take over, their power would grow exponentially.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin sneered, his gaze turning cold as he shouted toward the Turner family members in the distance. "Carolyn, Rose! What are you still standing around for?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony has already joined Mr. Foster! Are you still in denial? You'd better come over and kneel to welcome him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn and Rose exchanged glances before looking toward Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony gave them a reassuring smile, signaling them to remain calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't waste any more time with them," said Anne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that they hadn't moved, Anne grew impatient and shouted to the rest of the group. "Everyone, kneel now and show our loyalty to Mr. Foster!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once he returns, we will join the Evil Spirit Legion and rise to power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They have to admit that Anne's readiness to act as a sycophant was quite impressive.</span></p></div>
