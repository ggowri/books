        <h1>Chapter 120 The Beauty</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Drugs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose's words made both Anthony and Carolyn pause in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's possible," Carolyn responded, her mind racing. "Think about it, the Turner family's most valuable asset is their vast stockpile of pharmaceuticals."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pharmaceuticals are the foundation of the Turner family. The inventory is vast, priceless...," Carolyn continued before pausing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She frowned and added, "But if it's about pharmaceuticals, the Evil Spirit Legion wouldn't go to such extremes to attack the Turner family, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the Turner family's pharmaceutical supply might be incredibly valuable, it wasn't necessarily something the Evil Spirit Legion would make such a loud, aggressive move for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not impossible," Anthony said after considering it carefully. "Aside from the drugs, I can't think of anything else that would warrant such a large-scale attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever the Evil Spirit Legion's true intentions are, for now, pharmaceuticals seem like the most plausible reason."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The idea of the Evil Spirit Legion launching such a grand assault over drugs seemed illogical at first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as Anthony had said, it was the most likely explanation at this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long day of planning and fighting, everyone was exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dinner, they all retired to their rooms to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Rose's bedroom, Helen had considerately changed the bedding and prepared new slippers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The faint fragrance floating in the air was refreshing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she entered the room, before Anthony could take a move, Rose rushed over and kissed him passionately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They both enjoyed the kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose's initiative was beyond Anthony's expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Anthony didn't let her down. He responded to her kiss enthusiastically, picked her up by the waist, and strode into the bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the crazy and passionate kiss, Rose found herself melting in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Anthony, he became even more excited, and his blood boiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose felt as if she was wrapped in a ball of fire. Her whole body relaxed, and her blood boiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An invisible force in Anthony flowed into his meridians along with the blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she took off her clothes, Rose's skin was glowing under the light. She looked tender and juicy as a real rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was such a beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was filled with passion and hugged her tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they were enjoying the lovemaking, Anthony couldn't help but be distracted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remembered that in the chip Jane gave him, there was a 108-style dual cultivation technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, Anthony didn't care much about this, but now it seemed to be useful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the techniques in the chip are stored in Devil Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, it is stored in Anthony's memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he had not practiced it before, if he wanted to use it now, it would only be easy for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Anthony didn't hesitate to pull Rose up, who was sweating profusely, and adjusted his position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose exclaimed and then let out an uncontrollable moan, which made Anthony thrilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were 108 styles, and Anthony had only performed three. Rose cried out softly, and then she began to tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony knew it was the perfect timing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony smiled triumphantly, and instead of stopping, he sped up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose couldn't stop trembling and panting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Anthony felt relaxed all over. The boiling blood and energy turned into an invisible force and poured into his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was extremely surprised. He thought it was just a pure sex technique, but he didn't expect it to be a real technique that could help enhance his superpower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose was sweating profusely and still trembling slightly. The blush on her cheeks took a long time to fade away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After resting for a moment, Rose lay on Anthony's chest, drawing circles on his muscular body with her finger, while blushing and complaining.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you like it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony chuckled and reached out with his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blushing, Rose nodded and then said, "Anthony, don't you think... your superpower seems to have improved a little?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was stunned. He asked, "Your power has also increased? Was it just now or after the end?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Both, I guess."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose, still feeling a bit shy, blushed deeper and said, "But, after, it felt a bit stronger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of joy filled Anthony's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, on second thought, he secretly said that it was foolish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a dual cultivation technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since it was a dual cultivation, Rose's power will certainly be strengthened to a certain extent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kind of technique, which allowed one to indulge in romance with beautiful women while increasing one's strength, was exactly what every man dreams of!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a burst of joy, Anthony began his movements again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony wanted more, not only for power improvement but also for Rose's charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With such a beauty in his arms, wouldn't it be a pity to only have sex with her once?</span></p></div>
