        <h1>Chapter 76 Stubborn</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolves came together, well-trained and powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony seemed silent, but he was waiting patiently for Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was not too worried about Carolyn's situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the leader of the Turner family, Carolyn must have a trump card, and the werewolves couldn't do anything to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, a moment later, the werewolves exploded in a cloud of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, a giant sword condensed from yellow sand broke through the werewolves' blockade and soared into the sky, unstoppable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following the giant sword was Carolyn, who broke out of the werewolves at a breakneck speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone exclaimed, "Great! Ms. Carolyn Turner comes out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Carolyn break through the siege, everyone in the banquet hall exclaimed, and the Turner family members were so excited that they even burst into tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others were also excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For them, they didn't have to worry as long as Carolyn was safe and sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason said, "Do you want to run? Children, set up the formation again and make sure to trap her to death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn broke through with great force, and the werewolves rushed forward. The terrifying evil spirit swept across the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a strange blood mist spread and then covered an area of 109 feet in radius in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a formation, werewolves' formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, no!" Carolyn was horrified. The power of the formation was extraordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, given her current condition, she would be dead if she were trapped again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the critical moment, Carolyn waved both her hands, and the elemental power in her body flourished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The yellow sand turned into a giant sword, and the sword tip broke through the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn faced the three werewolves and chopped them down fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The giant sword fell, and the three werewolves were killed on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when the three werewolves fell, seven or eight werewolves immediately pounced up and blocked Carolyn's way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The giant sword was mighty, but it couldn't stop the werewolves from coming one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After several rounds, Carolyn failed to break through and was knocked away by the werewolves' sharp claws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a shocking scratch on her shoulder, a bloody mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Aunt Carolyn..." Rose was horrified and screamed subconsciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Carolyn Turner..." The other members of the Turner family were also terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd, who had been excited just now, suddenly fell silent and began to tremble with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolves' power was beyond their imagination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's expression gradually changed, and he asked Jane, "Do you know what formation this is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane did not hesitate and said, "Werewolves' Hematic Matrix. I have only heard of it before, and it is the first time I have seen it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is an evil spell unique to Evil Spirit Legion that sets up formations at the cost of burning blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Usually, three or more werewolves are needed to burn their blood together and set it up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The power of the formation varied depending on the number of werewolves and their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In short, once you are trapped, you can either use your super strength to forcibly break it, or wait for the werewolves to remove the formation on their own initiative or until their blood are exhausted."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the mortal enemy of the Evil Spirit Legion, Jane knew something about some of the werewolves' methods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Generally speaking, werewolves would not cast formations easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, it was the first time Jane had seen it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Burning blood?" frowned Anthony, and a bad premonition arose in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right." Jane nodded and continued, "If there are four or five werewolves, it will be easier to break the formation because their blood is limited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the formation set up by dozens of werewolves together is extremely powerful..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Jane was speaking, Alvin in the crowd sneered and said proudly, "Everyone, you </span><span>have all seen how ferocious the werewolf is, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Turner family's death is coming. Are you still stubborn? Anthony is just a damn bastard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Carolyn was willing to perish with the Evil Spirit Legion for him. What about you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just now, Carolyn had displayed her great power, so Alvin didn't dare to say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, seeing Carolyn in trouble, he immediately became excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne also laughed and said proudly, "The demise of the Turner family is almost a foregone conclusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you still going to be stubborn and follow the Turner family's lead?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I advise you to be sensible and draw a clear line between yourself and the Turner family and Anthony as soon as possible. Or, you'll die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Anne raised her head and looked at Rose and Anthony with a proud and complacent expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, Rose had announced in public that she would ban and terminate all cooperation with the Blake family and the Smith family and anyone who cooperated with them would be regarded as an enemy by the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a while, the Smith family and the Blake family had become the target of public criticism, and everyone avoided them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne thought, "If we had not been fortunate enough to encounter the Evil Spirit Legion, we would have been beaten to death by our family by now, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the situation has totally changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn and the Turner family are both in danger. I will not miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, Anne wanted to disgust Rose and vent her anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Second, she wanted to win over all the guests' hearts and isolate the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne really had a vicious mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone said, "What should we do? The Turner family is not really going to be destroyed, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another said, "It's hard to say. The werewolves are so numerous and powerful that I think Ms. Carolyn Turner probably can't handle them. If this continues, it won't be long before the werewolves rush in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd in the hall had already been somewhat at a loss because of Carolyn's defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, under the instigation of Anne and Alvin, the crowd became a commotion, whispering to each other.</span></p></div>
