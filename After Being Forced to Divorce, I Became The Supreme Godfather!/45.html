        <h1>Chapter 44 Going Solo</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a show of sincerity, Jane left the storage chip completely unprotected. The moment Anthony activated his Devil Eye and touched it, a wealth of information flooded his senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He found extensive materials including The Collection of Firearms Skills of the Special Forces, The Secret of Close Combat of the Royal Guards, and Disguise and Invisibility...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he stumbled upon a treasure trove. Without pausing to sift through the details, he quickly initiated the copying and storage process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the invaluable information from the chip was transferred to the Devil Eye and seamlessly integrated into Anthony's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a slight pressure in his head as he checked the remaining storage capacity of the Devil Eye. There wasn't much space left. The last time he had stored a vast amount of knowledge about spiritual medicine, and now these new skills took up 90% of the device's capacity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he wanted to absorb more information in the future, he'd need to upgrade the Devil Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had no idea how to do that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't dwell on it now; he needed to head back and digest this knowledge as quickly as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks, I'll take it. Bye!" Anthony said excitedly as he turned away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's eyes widened in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at the chip still in her palm, confused. Anthony clearly refused it, so why did he say he took it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pondered and realized he might just have appreciated her kindness. As for the </span><span>skills in the chip, he didn't care at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made sense to Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the immense energy, effort, and money she had invested in acquiring these skills, they meant nothing to Anthony, who was destined to become the Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt foolish for offering such a trivial gift and vowed to find something truly worthy for him next time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in Rose's room, Anthony eagerly opened his Devil Eye, ready to explore the knowledge he had just stored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alongside firearm and close combat techniques, he found an array of other valuable skills: Killing Kick, Invincible Punch, Eagle Claw Attack, and more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, one name stood out among the skills: Seduction Trap, Male Version.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What the hell was that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recalled Jane's enchanting dance that had mesmerized the werewolf and wondered, "Does Jane want me to learn the male version of Seduction Trap?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Do I need to perform a striptease to attract women?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The very thought of himself dancing and performing seductive moves in front of Rose made him blush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that wasn't the main issue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most shocking discovery lay at the end of the skill catalog: a section labeled "Practice of Sex."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony couldn't help swallowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitated but ultimately couldn't resist opening the directory. Instantly, vivid images surged into his mind&mdash;men and women, all looking blissful in each scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a collection of sexual techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Jane dropping hints?" Anthony wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Imagining the joy of using those 108 sexual techniques on Jane sent his heart racing, nearly causing him to lose his composure. He was tempted to rush to her for a little experimentation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he forced himself to stay calm and focused, diving into the study of these skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the assistance of the Devil Eye, he was a sharpshooter and a close combat expert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he knew those were the Devil Eye's abilities, not his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the energy of the Devil Eye ran out, he'd revert to being an ordinary person, vulnerable and easily defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood he needed to master these skills and not rely on external powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determined, he dedicated himself to learning them so that if the Devil Eye failed, he could still handle himself in a fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he encountered challenges, he wanted to be self-sufficient and not have to activate the Devil Eye, saving its energy for critical moments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Anthony was set to meet Rose at Turner Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unaware of the dangers that awaited him, he must prepare meticulously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He studied every minute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, when Jane learned of Anthony's plan to go to the Turner Manor, she felt worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Turner family has declared you the assassin who targeted Rose. Everyone sees you as a foe. It's too risky for you to go alone," she said. "It would be wise to wait until the werewolf wakes up, interrogate him, and clear your name before heading there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony recognized the wisdom in her advice; it was the best course of action at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet he shook his head. "I have a bad feeling that Rose is in danger or being wronged. I need to get there as quickly as possible to help her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's split up. You handle the interrogation of the werewolf and track down the four-fingered guy. I'll dig into things from inside the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's meet at the Turner Manor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane replied, "Today is Rose's 20th birthday, a significant day when the Turner family will announce her as the official heir and allow her to partake in family affairs. They've invited dignitaries from across Yoland for the celebration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The crowd will be diverse, and the situation will be complex. Mr. Johnson, you must be careful. I promise I'll arrive with the werewolf and answers before the party starts, and we'll regroup then."</span></p></div>
