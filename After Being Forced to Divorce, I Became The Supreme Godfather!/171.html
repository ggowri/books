        <h1>Chapter 170 Aggressive Approach</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even injured, Malakar's combat power remained formidable. The real problem was that Rose wasn't strong enough. She couldn't pull off long-range attacks like Carolyn. The limitations of Rose's elemental power were painfully obvious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose coughed up blood and collapsed onto the ground. Vincent waved a hand and ordered, "Take her</span><span> too</span><span>. Bring her back to the Mines."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weakly, she spat out, "Vincent... Anthony won't let you get away with this. Just wait. You'll never control the Turner family. Never..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony?" Vincent tilted his head back and let out a loud, arrogant laugh. "Give it a rest already. </span><span>Y</span><span>ou think I'd spare him? I </span><span>knew</span><span> he snuck off to Wolf Fang Valley</span><span>.</span><span> Let me tell you&mdash;Wolf Fang Valley is his grave. </span><span>He could never make it.</span><span> </span><span>So</span><span> save your words</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those words struck Rose like a bolt of lightning, and her expression turned to shock. Carolyn's face darkened as well. She thought, "Vincent knows Anthony went to Wolf Fang Valley? Does that mean this was all part of his plan? He orchestrated everything?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It made sense. Vincent had been colluding with the Evil Spirit Legion for ages. Anne and her crew had gone to Wolf Fang Valley just to align themselves with the Legion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the realization hit Carolyn, she was overcome with regret, but it was too late. She thought back to how Anthony had warned her something was off with the Mines and told her not to act recklessly. But she'd been blinded by her greed for the </span><span>Leyline</span><span> and ignored his advice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd underestimated Vincent's cunning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's regret weighed on her so heavily that she coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood and then collapsed unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent burst into uncontrollable laughter, exhilarated. With Carolyn taken down, the Turner family was as good as his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still laughing, he strode over and yanked the pendant off Carolyn's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Handing it to Sergio, he instructed, "</span><span>G</span><span>o inform the Elder Council of the Turner family. Tell them that Carolyn will hold her succession ceremony at the Turner family's Mines tomorrow at noon. That's when I'll announce myself as the next head of the Turner family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Vincent Turner." Sergio nodded respectfully, took the pendant, and hurried down the mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Rose was dragged to her feet. She glared at Vincent, her voice hoarse but defiant. "With the way you're pulling these dirty tricks, there's no way the Elder Council will ever back you as the head of the family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent scoffed dismissively, "Are you honestly still this na</span><span>i</span><span>ve? Do you think I need their support? </span><span>Accept it</span><span>&mdash;those who stand with me thrive, and those who oppose me die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those so-called Elder Council members? They're just a bunch of decrepit old fools. Inviting them to witness the ceremony is me giving them a shred of respect. If they're smart, they'll submit, and I might let them live. If not, I won't lose any sleep sending them to their graves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the words left his mouth, Vincent didn't drag things out. With a commanding wave of his hand, he barked, "Move out!" Leading the massive force, he marched back toward the Turner family's Mines in a grand, imposing procession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose clenched her teeth and fumed inwardly, "Vincent has lost it. He is completely insane." Too terrified to say anything out loud, she could only silently pray, "Anthony, please, you have to be okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the Turner Manor estate, Dariel hadn't slept a wink all night. Anthony had left, and so had Carolyn and Rose. Something felt off to Dariel, but he couldn't quite put his finger on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel had tried contacting Anthony a few times but couldn't get through. He figured Anthony had gone into the mountains to track Anne and probably turned off his phone, so he eventually gave up trying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As dawn broke and the sky turned faintly gray, the roar of engines pierced the early morning stillness. A convoy of over 10 armored vehicles, each bearing the Draconic Shield insignia, sped toward the estate and came to an abrupt stop right outside the gates of the Turner Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel, who had been resting with his eyes closed, immediately snapped them open at the sound. He spotted the Draconic Shield convoy through the window and furrowed his brows in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Draconic Shield was a big deal in Yoland. Their security forces had a hand in nearly every prominent family in the region, and the Turner family was no exception.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Draconic Shield was first established, Anthony had suggested that Carolyn bring in some of their personnel to bolster the Turner family's defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn had wasted no time implementing his suggestion, and now, a contingent of Draconic Shield operatives was stationed within the Turner estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, the arrival of a dozen armored vehicles and several off-road cars wasn't business as usual. Their aggressive approach made it clear they weren't here on friendly terms. Without hesitating, Dariel stepped out to investigate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Dariel stepped outside, Alvin climbed out of one of the armored vehicles with a smug grin on his face and muttered mockingly, "Looks like we showed up too early, folks. The show hasn't started yet..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right behind him came Anne, accompanied by a large group of people representing various families. The crowd was substantial, and every single person wore a smug, self-satisfied expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel's eyes widened in disbelief when he saw Anne and Alvin among the group. "Aren't they supposed to be in the </span><span>Virstino</span><span> Mountains?" he thought. "Judging by the time, they should be back by now, but why show up here? And with this much fanfare?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel stood outside the door and said in a deep voice, "What are you trying to pull this time, Anne? Don't think that just because you've latched onto the Evil Spirit Legion, you can waltz into the Turner Manor and act like you own the place. Here's my advice&mdash;turn around and leave. Now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd spent the entire night stewing in unease, and now his pent-up frustration boiled over. Seeing Anne and her entourage stroll up so arrogantly, clearly up to no good, only added fuel to the fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was no way he was going to greet them with anything resembling kindness.</span></p></div>
