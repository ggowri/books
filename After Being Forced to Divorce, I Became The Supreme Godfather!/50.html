        <h1>Chapter 49 The Master of Close Combat</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sergio felt humiliated and furious. He leaped up and spat blood, shouting, "No way! Switch to live ammunition!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His men, equally angry, immediately began loading live rounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!" Dariel bellowed, his face gloomy with anger. "Losers, don't you think you've embarrassed yourselves enough? You lost. Now get out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Sergio often disobeyed Dariel in private, he wouldn't dare challenge him openly due to Dariel's strength and standing. Glaring at Anthony, he ground his teeth and retreated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From that moment on, Anthony became Sergio's sworn enemy. He vowed to find an opportunity to kill Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was indifferent to Sergio's hatred; he had already undergone his transformation, and people like Sergio were insignificant in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's power had silenced any lingering contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne reluctantly spoke up, "Anthony, so you're a sharpshooter. You've been hiding your abilities for three years during our marriage. What are you really after?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin shouted, "Captain Stein, this guy must have some hidden agenda! Please investigate him thoroughly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel's gaze intensified as he addressed Anthony seriously, "You've truly impressed </span><span>me. Initially, I thought you were a space metahuman who could dodge bullets by manipulating space, but I see now that's not the case.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You countered while being flanked on three sides, predicting the bullets' trajectories and using your agile movements. You really do deserve the title of sharpshooter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony smiled in response. "Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel whispered, "But that alone won't cut it. Remember, your real opponent is me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on. If you can beat me, not only will I let you in, but I'll also fully support your investigation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel lowered his body slightly as he prepared for both defense and attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An overwhelming aura of menace radiated from him, making him appear vulnerable yet somehow untouchable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear he was a master of close combat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was what a werewolf was good at.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, Dariel was fighting Anthony as a regular Warrior, having not yet transformed into his true werewolf form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, for his part, didn't activate the Devil Eye. After consuming the mutant werewolf blood and essence extracted by the Seraph, his physical strength had reached Warrior level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, last night, he had acquired a vast array of skills from Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he assessed the secrets of close combat used by the Royal Guards, the blood in his veins began to ignite with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's over for him. When it comes to close combat, Captain Stein is unbeatable in Yoland!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, give it up! Just because you can shoot doesn't mean you can take on Captain Stein. You're asking for trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laughter erupted around him, disbelief evident in their voices.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of them thought Anthony stood a chance against Dariel in hand-to-hand combat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Dariel's expression grew increasingly serious. As an expert, he recognized that while Anthony appeared relaxed, he was actually poised for both offense and defense&mdash;a level of skill only a true master could achieve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel hadn't expected to face a tough opponent today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe such a powerful fighter existed in Yoland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, he planned to wait for Anthony to strike first, but the tension compelled him to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a roar, he sprang into the air, his movements a blur. In an instant, he was above Anthony, his fist descending like a diamond hammer, creating a gust of wind as it crashed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His first move was a swift, lethal strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed Anthony had anticipated this; he smoothly dodged to the side, narrowly avoiding Dariel's punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a resounding boom, Dariel's fist smashed into the ground, creating a massive crater and sending sand and gravel flying everywhere. The spectators screamed and backed away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Captain Stein is awesome!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's amazing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This punch is invincible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, is dodging all you can do? What kind of man are you? If you have any guts, fight Captain Stein head-on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted into wild shouts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like they had been transported back to an ancient arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony pushed aside all distractions and focused on his battle with Dariel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fists clashed, feet struck out, and the intensity of their fight filled the air with a fierce wind and an atmosphere thick with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, those who had looked down on Anthony fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strength he displayed before them erased any doubt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mockery that he was just a powerless freeloader, that he relied on drugs to unleash a fleeting potential, and that he was merely boasting&mdash;all of it was proven wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone had to concede one undeniable truth: Anthony was not just a sharpshooter but also a master Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a top-tier fighter, taking on Dariel, the captain of the Turner family guards, without faltering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible? When did this loser become so powerful? No, I can't accept this," Anne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she watched Anthony's commanding presence, she realized she had let go of a treasure. Her eyes misted with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she cast a glance at the shocked Alvin beside her, her regret deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne silently vowed that if Anthony truly defeated Dariel, she would publicly apologize to him and ask for a second chance at their marriage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She believed Anthony loved her deeply, and if she showed him kindness, he would surely come back to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Anthony's support, Anne felt confident she could elevate the Smith family to one of the top families in Yoland in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She imagined the admiration she would receive then, smiling mysteriously like a devoted wife gazing at her valiant husband on the battlefield.</span></p></div>
