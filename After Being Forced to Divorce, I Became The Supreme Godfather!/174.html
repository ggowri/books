        <h1>Chapter 173 Something's Gone Terribly Wrong</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Anne and her group erupted into cheers and shouts, Sergio threw his head back and laughed triumphantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smirked at Dariel. "See that? Mr. Vincent Turner will own Yoland. Fight him, and you die. Simple as that. Mr. Vincent Turner has made it clear&mdash;those who stand with him thrive, and those who oppose him perish."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if worried that Dariel might make a move, Sergio didn't linger after finishing speaking. With a wave of his hand, he ordered, "Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go, go, go! Let's all pay our respects to Mr. Vincent Turner and attend his succession ceremony!" Anne exclaimed in delight, eagerly leading the </span><span>other</span><span> families as they hurried to follow Sergio.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd dispersed in an instant, leaving Dariel frozen in place, completely at a loss. </span><span>"What the hell is this," he muttered, his voice tinged with disbelief. Everything had happened so quickly that it felt surreal, like a strange and fleeting dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The major families of Yoland siding with the Evil Spirit Legion didn't come as a surprise to Dariel and Abel. After all, the events at the banquet had already caused a scandal across the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they never expected </span><span>that Vincent had also allied himself with the Evil Spirit Legion&mdash;and not just recently. He had been working with them for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What made the situation even more critical was that Sergio had brought along Carolyn's pendant. This left Dariel and Abel deeply uneasy, wondering about her fate. Whether she was alive or dead, no one knew for sure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long silence, Abel finally spoke, "Let's go. We'll go convene the Elder Council." </span><span>H</span><span>e turned and headed back toward the Turner Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was </span><span>something big</span><span>, and they couldn't make decisions on their own. Whether they went to the Mines or not, they needed to notify the Turner family's Elder Council first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel swallowed nervously and followed Abel into the Turner Manor. As they walked, Dariel pulled out his phone and dialed Anthony's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the call could connect, the screeching sound of tires braking pierced the air. They turned around just in time to see Anthony stumbling out of a car, his steps unsteady and his body covered in blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel's face shifted instantly at the sight. Rushing over, he called out anxiously, "Mr. Johnson! Mr. Johnson, what happened to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner Manor looked quiet. Anthony let out a breath. "What about Carolyn and Rose? Are they okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle at the </span><span>Virstino</span><span> Mountains had left </span><span>him</span><span> severely injured. Despite his wounds, he had pressed on, trekking through rugged terrain in a desperate race to get here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well..." Dariel hesitated, biting his lip. After a brief pause, he steeled himself and began, "Ms. Carolyn Turner might be in trouble. Last night, she received a message from Vincent&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he continued, </span><span>Anthony's brows furrowed, a sinking feeling clawing its way into his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn and Rose had rushed to the Mines overnight and were now missing. Sergio had Carolyn's pendant. He had even summoned the Turner family's Elder Council to the Mines to attend Vincent's succession ceremony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And, to top it all off, Sergio had brazenly admitted in front of everyone that they were colluding with the Evil Spirit Legion while rallying the major families of Yoland to join him at the Mines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A whirlwind of revelations crashed down on Anthony, leaving him barely able to hold himself together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony thought grimly, "Something's gone terribly wrong. Vincent wouldn't dare make such a bold move unless he had something massive backing him. And Carolyn&mdash;she's a bona fide Level C elemental Metahuman. Most </span><span>E</span><span>xperts wouldn't even come close to matching her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That means Vincent must have more powerful </span><span>E</span><span>xperts by his side. In addition to the strong </span><span>Necros</span><span>, there must be another </span><span>E</span><span>xpert on par with a Level C elemental </span><span>Metahuman. The Evil Spirit Legion is playing for keeps this time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The </span><span>Leyline</span><span>! It's not hard to guess&mdash;the Evil Spirit Legion is helping Vincent for the Turner family's </span><span>Leyline</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The importance of the </span><span>Leyline</span><span> went without saying. Anthony knew the Evil Spirit Legion wouldn't take any chances, and he couldn't rule out the possibility of even more </span><span>E</span><span>xperts lying in wait. With the enemy lurking in the shadows while they stood exposed, acting recklessly would be a foolish mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abel moved with lightning speed. In less than half an hour, the </span><span>members of </span><span>Elder Council had gathered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a quick wash, Anthony sat down in a side seat in the hall. The reason he freshened up was simple&mdash;he didn't want to appear disheveled in front of the Elder Council. The Turners were in deep </span><span>trouble</span><span>. As their last hope, Anthony couldn't lose his cool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Anthony began, "Everyone, what are your thoughts on this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His question caused many to hesitate. They exchanged nervous glances, unsure of how to respond. "Well..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Elder Council consisted mostly of senior members of the family&mdash;advanced in age, with high status&mdash;but lacking both real authority and significant strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony followed up, his tone firm. "Ladies and gentlemen, the Evil Spirit Legion has committed unforgivable crimes. We cannot submit to them so easily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the elders spoke up, "That's right. The Turner family has stood strong for centuries. How can we cower before an evil organization?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another elder added passionately, "Exactly! What nonsense is the Evil Spirit Legion? If worst comes to worst, we fight them to the end, even if it means going down together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A scoffing voice cut in. "Fight? Fight with what? At this point, shouting slogans won't get us anywhere."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another elder chimed in, more cautious. "That's right. What do you even mean by going down together? Do you realize how many lives we're talking about? Do you know just how many people in the Turner family would be lost if we do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A more pragmatic voice joined. "Call it what you want, but knowing when to step back is sometimes the wiser choice. Don't get me wrong&mdash;I'm not afraid of dying, I just don't want to see countless innocent lives dragged into this mess..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But someone immediately snapped, "Shut your mouth. Are you suggesting we surrender to the Evil Spirit Legion? How dare you even say that? You call yourself an elder of the Turner family? You're nothing but a coward!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pragmatic elder retorted with a sneer, "Ha! That's rich coming from you. If you're so fearless, why don't you lead the charge against the Evil Spirit Legion? Why yell at me about it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For a moment, the hall fell into brief silence&mdash;only to erupt into chaos seconds later. The once dignified council room turned into a war zone, with elders shouting over one another. Their wrinkled faces were flushed with anger, and it seemed as if their dentures might fly out at any moment, straight onto each other's faces.</span></p></div>
