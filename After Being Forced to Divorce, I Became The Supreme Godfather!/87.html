        <h1>Chapter 86 The Time Is Ripe</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the perfect time to attack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony couldn't bear to hesitate. In a situation where he could hardly defeat Mason with his fists, he couldn't afford the slightest bit of slack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So he took a step forward, still moving straight ahead at an incredibly fast speed and punched hard at Mason's chest!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ouch!" Mason howled in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Anthony coming after him, Mason growled furiously. "Damn it! You dare to toy with me? I'll definitely tear you up..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason, caught off guard for a moment, took a solid punch from Anthony and found himself at a disadvantage. He also felt humiliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Mason discerned that Anthony had been hiding his true power after being punched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then a surge of uncontrollable ferocious aura erupted from his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, before he could finish his curse, Anthony rushed over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His iron fist, brimming with terrifying power, relentlessly pounded down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Mason cursed, quickly clamping his mouth shut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He forcefully took a step back to stabilize his body and hastily retaliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his hasty punch could not possibly withstand Anthony's fierce strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Anthony attacked again, Mason retreated several steps once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And with each step he took back, the ground beneath his feet would quake violently, which manifest how powerful Anthony's punches were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People exclaimed, "Why is this happening? Is Anthony really that strong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Mason retreated again, the onlookers were all shocked with their eyes widening in amazement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ts, don't be fooled!" Anne's face sulked as she reminded them, "Don't forget, he's just a drug-dependent loser.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the power of the drugs, not his own strength. The more powerful the drugs are, the faster he will die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait to witness how Anthony will surely die from ruptured blood vessels within fifteen minutes at most..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He relies on the power unleashed by drugs. Such immense strength will inevitably have a powerful backlash on his body."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This loser is truly courting death, daring to fight so fiercely relying on drugs; he deserves the end of death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! He's just a loser who relies on drugs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He actually intended to defeat Mr. Foster. What an idiot..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Anne's analysis, the onlookers all believed that Anthony was bluffing and began to gloat at him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! You son of..." As the crowd buzzed with discussion, Mason erupted in anger again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before he could finish his tirade, Anthony kicked him in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He really wanted to kick the hell out of this bastard's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, he bent down to dodge Mason's kick and then punched him in the back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Mason could counter back, Anthony circled around to his side and smashed his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's attacks were relentless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His punches had the speed of a bolt and came from unexpected angles!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a battle between strong opponents, a moment of carelessness could put one at an irretrievable disadvantage and even lead to death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason Anthony chose to provoke Mason was to wait for this very moment to press his advantage without giving him a chance to catch his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the intensity of the situation, Anne and the others couldn't help but fall silent in front of Anthony's daunting press.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Devastating as Mason, he was purely on the defensive, and his attempts to counterattack seemed feeble and ineffective.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An ominous presentiment struck Anne; Mason might lose! Then, she tried her best to calm down and drove this thought out of her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's dominance left Anne trembling with fear and deep concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For her, Anthony had to die. If he killed Mason, then the crisis for the Turner family would also be resolved, which would lead to the disaster for the Smith family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How... How can it be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne was not the only one concerned by the situation. Alvin and other onlookers were also terrified by Anthony's power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a momentary shock, everyone involuntarily took a few steps back to distance themselves from Mason and approached Rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Estimating the situation, they knew that if Anthony really defeated Mason, they needed to count on the Turner family for their prospects in Yoland.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far away, Rose noticed their intention and frowned at those waverers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she didn't bother to spare her attention to those irrelevant people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just fixed her eyes on Anthony with admiration and worries about his safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's fight tugged at Rose's heart. Every punch, every kick made her heart race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hoped that Anthony could defeat Mason without getting hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, as for Anthony, he had spotted the best chance to slay his enemy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the gate, after a series of relentless attacks, Anthony, seeing the right moment, flipped his wrist and decided to draw Dragonfang to slay Mason!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason's rage was almost bursting out of his Devil Eye!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And his raging anger was precisely the perfect opportunity Anthony had been longing for!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Onlookers saw only Anthony's ferocity but were unaware that his fists and feet alone were far from enough to defeat Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To put it mildly, after Anthony's consecutive attacks, Mason didn't even have a scratch. His howls were purely out of frustration from being hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to kill the werewolf with Dragonfang, and it was precisely because he knew this that Anthony hadn't used Dragonfang yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, the moment was ripe!</span></p></div>
