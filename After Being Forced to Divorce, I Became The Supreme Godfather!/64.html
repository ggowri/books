        <h1>Chapter 63 A Deadly Gift</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Carolyn stepped forward to personally welcome Jane, everyone else eagerly followed her lead, turning their attention toward the manor's gates with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rhythmic clatter of hooves and the creak of wheels filled the air as a horse-drawn carriage approached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane herself held the reins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat on the carriage shaft, a whip in her hand. Unlike her usual aloof demeanor, today she wore a flowing red dress with a begonia flower tucked behind her ear. Her expression was soft and gentle, resembling a tender woman from the countryside venturing to the battlefield in search of her husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze swept past Carolyn, the Turner family members, and the assembled guests, landing on Anthony seated in the head position. Her eyes instantly lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hyah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a joyful cry, she flicked the whip lightly, urging the horse to gallop faster. The powerful steed surged forward, carrying the carriage to the crowd in mere moments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Ronald's presence is a tremendous honor for the Turner family," Carolyn declared. "Rose, come forward and greet her at once!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose quickly stood up. Today was her birthday party, and Jane had been invited as an honored guest. As the host, she should have been the first to greet her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that she didn't understand etiquette; it was just that her hand was still holding Anthony's, helping him restore his energy. At such a critical moment, she didn't want to abandon him halfway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Carolyn's words, Rose made a move to stand, but Anthony tightened his grip on her hand. "Ms. Ronald," Anthony called out firmly, "Ms. Turner is indisposed. Please, make yourself comfortable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The boldness of his words stunned everyone. Even Carolyn, who had started to warm to Anthony, glared at him in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His earlier closeness with Rose had already caused a stir, but now, as a distinguished guest arrived, the two sat motionless, fingers intertwined, showing no intention of standing to greet her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was outright disrespect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, who the hell do you think you are to behave so rudely toward my goddess?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent roared, seething with rage. "I'll kill you where you sit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's voice was icy with disapproval. "Rose, have you forgotten even the most </span><span>basic etiquette? Anthony may be an unrefined hooligan, but must you follow his example?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Carolyn, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose's face flushed red as she struggled to find words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To everyone's surprise, Jane wasn't upset. Instead, she smiled warmly. "Ms. Turner and Mr. Johnson make such a lovely pair," Jane said softly. "It's only natural they'd want to spend a little more time together. It seems my arrival has interrupted their moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner, please take care of Mr. Johnson. Don't worry about me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose's face turned an even deeper shade of crimson, her heart pounding wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A part of her wanted to pull away from Anthony and hide in embarrassment. Yet the comfort of sitting beside him, their hands entwined, was something she didn't want to let go of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, while it seemed she was using her superpower to heal Anthony, she felt as if his very presence was mending her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Summoning her courage, she replied shyly, "Anthony is my friend. He's feeling unwell, and I need to care for him. Ms. Ronald, I'm sorry for my rudeness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's smile deepened. "That's quite all right. After all, we're family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her unexpectedly affable demeanor left everyone, including Carolyn, puzzled. Jane had always been known for her lofty airs and quick temper. Anyone who crossed her would usually face her wrath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But today, Jane seemed completely different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn couldn't help but wonder, "Why the sudden change?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew the Turner family's power alone wasn't enough to warrant this kind of respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought to herself, "Is it because of someone else?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who could that person be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but glance at Anthony but immediately shook her head. "Anthony is nothing special. How could Jane show him such respect?" she thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent suddenly brightened with excitement and said eagerly, "We're family? Jane, you mean we're family, does that mean you've agreed to my pursuit?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, everyone was stunned! It turned out that Vincent liked Jane, and he was pursuing her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all taken aback, but after thinking it over, they found it quite reasonable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Yoland, only a woman like Jane could make Vincent so infatuated and desirous beyond his wildest dreams. At the same time, everyone subtly felt that if Jane were to choose a partner in Yoland, Vincent would be the only one truly worthy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them together would be a perfect match and a strong partnership.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Jane had just said that she was part of the Turner family. They felt that she had already decided to marry Vincent and become a member of the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That explains it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the true embodiment of a perfect match, a union of talent and beauty, a strong partnership!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Congratulations to Mr. Vincent Turner! And to Ms. Ronald for finding such a fine </span><span>husband!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing this, Alvin quickly exclaimed his congratulations loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others also scrambled to flatter and praise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted in a chorus of praises and blessings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Carolyn allowed herself a smile. She knew Vincent harbored ambitions of becoming the family's patriarch but had always favored Rose due to Vincent's secondary lineage and lackluster attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, if Vincent could marry a woman like Jane, who could become a powerful ally, that would be a different story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn even thought to herself that if Jane really agreed to marry Vincent, she might have to support Vincent as the successor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Ronald," Carolyn asked hopefully, "do you truly see yourself as part of our family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Vincent, overwhelmed with joy, rushed to Jane, dropped to one knee, and declared passionately, "Jane, I offer my very life in this proposal. If you accept me, my life will be yours forever!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dramatic gesture left the crowd abuzz.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne, green with envy, whispered to Alvin, "Look at Mr. Vincent Turner. He is so romantic and devoted. You'd better propose to me like that someday!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin snorted. "Let's focus on watching Anthony lose his life first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane never imagined that a casual remark of hers would cause such a huge misunderstanding with Vincent. Feeling helpless, she said, "Vincent, what are you doing? I said I'm family with Rose, not with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent paused for a moment and asked, "You're family with Rose?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane replied, "Yes. Because I'm Mr. Johnson's person, and Mr. Johnson likes Ms. Turner. They're going to be a family, so Ms. Turner is my family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you say? You're with Anthony?" Vincent was almost speechless, his jaw nearly hitting the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then Jane's next words hit him like a thunderclap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold smile, Jane said, "But you're right to entrust your life to me today. Because the gift I gave you today could very well cost you your life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was stunned, and their eyes immediately turned toward the carriage behind Jane.</span></p></div>
