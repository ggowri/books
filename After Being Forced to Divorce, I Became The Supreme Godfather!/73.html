        <h1>Chapter 72 Giant Werewolf</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the captain of the Turner Guards, Dariel had the responsibility to protect the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading the crowd to fight, Dariel rushed to the front of the team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mutated werewolves were extremely ferocious. Dariel did not dare to be careless. His clenched fists were like wolf claws, unstoppable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill. Kill all these beasts." Rushing out, Dariel forced the werewolves back while shouting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them." The members of the Turner Guards were all tough guys. Seeing Dariel's bravery, they were unwilling to fall behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First of all, they were the Turner family's guards, and protecting the Turner family was their duty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Secondly, Carolyn had just said that there would be a reward of one hundred million dollars for killing a werewolf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There would always be brave men when there was a big reward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, the Turner Guards fought desperately, showing strong cohesion and combat effectiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a fierce battle, the werewolves, who had been so powerful that they broke through the gate, not only failed to invade the Turner Manor but were beaten out by the Turner Guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone exclaimed, "They're so strong. As expected of the Turner Guards, no one can match their strength."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another sneered, "Humph. Werewolves dare to act so recklessly in the Turner Manor. They are courting death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Turner family is indeed very powerful. Those werewolves seem to be so weak," said another man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle outside was projected onto the big screen. The desperate fight of Dariel and his men made everyone excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many members of the Turner family in the crowd couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief. It seemed that the werewolves would not break through the main gate in a short time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Anthony frowned slightly, feeling that something was wrong, thinking, "The werewolves came with great force. Is this all their strength? Something is wrong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the crowd talk about it, Alvin sneered, "It is just the beginning. You're happy too early.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Carolyn Turner, I still say the same thing. Hand over Anthony and the Turner family will be spared from death. If you insist on, this day next year will be the Turner family's memorial day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Alvin's words, everyone looked at Carolyn once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's expression was calm, and her deep eyes were fixed on the big screen, ignoring Alvin's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stubborn." Alvin was so angry that he yelled, "Just wait. You will regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Alvin finished speaking, the werewolves outside the gate launched another fierce attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike the previous one, the werewolves' attack this time was highly ferocious and powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few rounds, Dariel and his men, who had rushed out of the gate, were forced back by the werewolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shit. Damn beast." Outside the gate, Dariel couldn't help but curse angrily after being kicked back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Werewolves who had relied purely on drug mutation to stimulate their potential were indeed not as strong as a true metahuman like Dariel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, under the stimulation of drugs, the werewolves could burst out with powerful strength in a short period.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the help of drugs, more than a dozen werewolves' original Level A strength increased rapidly in a short period, approaching the terrifying Level B.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the critical moment, Dariel's body shook, and his muscles and bones crackled. In an instant, his body grew up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he transformed into a half-man, half-wolf giant werewolf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel had an awakening wolf nature and an orthodox bloodline, so he was a head taller than those mutant werewolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His whole body exuded a chilling aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the transformation was completed, Dariel slashed down with one claw, knocking out a mutant werewolf and making his body fill with blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel was a true beast metahuman, and his strength was far more potent than that of a </span><span>werewolf stimulated by drugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Dariel did not kill that werewolf with one blow but instead aroused his bestiality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That werewolf raised his head and howled, then rushed forward again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, more than a dozen mutant werewolves launched an attack on Dariel together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them." Seeing the werewolves gathering, the Turner Guards refused to be outdone and shouted, rushing forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle outside the gate entered a fierce stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the werewolves so ferocious, Anne couldn't help but sneer, "Ms. Turner, how long do you think he can last? The Evil Spirit Legion is very vengeful. You'd better hand over Anthony, or the werewolves will not stop until you die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I advise you not to kill everyone in the Turner family just because of a bastard like Anthony. Everyone, what do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne crossed her arms, looking at others with interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, everyone was frightened and worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin also sneered, "Ms. Carolyn Turner, the Evil Spirit Legion will not stop until you die. What are you still hesitating about?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you continue to be so indecisive, the Turner family will be ruined in your hands. Is it worth it for Anthony, a bastard?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone echoed, "Yes. Ms. Carolyn Turner, please don't hesitate. Anthony has no relationship with the Turner family. Why would you do that for an outsider?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another said, "In my opinion, we should capture Anthony and hand him over to the Evil Spirit Legion for disposal. We can even make friends with them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing what Alvin had said, many people could not bear it anymore and tried to persuade Carolyn fearfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the Turner family, handing over Anthony was the simplest and most direct way.</span></p></div>
