        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose gasped, a mix of nervousness and panic in her voice, which only made Anthony laugh harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd already spilled the beans and only now realized her slip of the tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it's okay..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Anthony doubled over with laughter, Rose smiled and added, "After all, I belong to you, Anthony. Eventually, you'll be running the Turner family anyway, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, yeah, of course..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony froze for a moment before quickly nodding his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run the Turner family?" he scoffed inwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His future was set as the Godfather! How could the mere Turner family ever contain his ambitions?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After some thought, Anthony asked, "So after all these years of development, have they found anything in the Mines?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose shook her head helplessly and said, "The Mines are in terrible condition. Plus, there are always poisonous creatures, dangerous animals, and traces of bandits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Development has been crawling along. If Grandfather hadn't specifically insisted, we would've given up on it long ago."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony mulled this over for a moment before saying, "Well, in that case, there's no need to worry about it right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When we have time, we can go check it out together. And if Vincent keeps being stubborn, we might as well kick him out of the family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose hesitated before speaking. "Let's wait until Aunt Carolyn gets back before jumping to conclusions. We don't know the whole story yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe Vincent was just blowing off steam. Give it some time, and things might settle down on their own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony didn't push the matter further after Rose's comment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he couldn't shake the feeling that it wasn't that simple. Vincent was the type who'd stop at nothing to get what he wanted. He wouldn't back down easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They rested for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon enough, Anthony got his second wind, and Rose recovered, too. They spent the next few hours lost in passion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Anthony advanced to the eighth position of his unique technique, and Rose was noticeably more confident and eager, wholly caught up in the pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After their exhausting night, Anthony and Rose slept well past morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen had no choice but to knock on their door, informing them that Carolyn had returned and had been waiting for them for quite a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After freshening up, they headed to the main hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, they found Aunt Carolyn, along with several Turner family elders, all wearing grave expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they entered, Rose whispered that the three elders seated below were previously in charge of the Mines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They took their seats at Carolyn's right hand, and Rose asked, "Aunt Carolyn, why the urgent summons? Is something wrong at the Mines?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether due to the crowd or something else, Carolyn shook her head. "No, the Mines are running fine for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vincent was just a bit too eager to prove himself. It's understandable&mdash;no need to worry too much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I called you here because of Anthony."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony stared at Carolyn, wholly puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes." Carolyn nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Late last night, we received solid intel that the Smith family has made contact with the Evil Spirit Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And Anne has been going around, swearing up and down to every family that the Evil Spirit Legion will definitely send representatives to this family banquet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've also heard that you're on their hit list, Anthony. Word is, they're not just coming for the banquet! They're planning to take you out while they're at it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn directed these last words straight at Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose jumped, startled by this news, and instinctively grabbed Anthony's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony just smiled and said, "Aunt Carolyn, are you trying to convince me to skip the Smith family's banquet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly!" Carolyn cut straight to the chase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After what happened last time, the Evil Spirit Legion won't be taking any chances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they're bold enough to send someone, it's got to be serious. That's why I want you to stay here with the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Turner family has weathered every storm in Yoland for hundreds of years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the Evil Spirit Legion is dead set on destroying the Turner family, then so be it! We'll go down together if we have to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bottom line is, this all started because of the Turner family, and we'll do whatever it takes to ensure your safety."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's words carried an unwavering resolve and dead seriousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony couldn't help but be deeply moved by Carolyn's dedication.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't even considered that if the Evil Spirit Legion attended the family banquet, it would signal their acceptance of other families' allegiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that happened, the Turner family would face an uphill battle in Yoland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be more precise, the Turner family would have no place left to stand in Yoland at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet despite all this, Carolyn's first instinct was to protect Anthony at any cost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for your kindness, Aunt Carolyn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Anthony continued, "But you don't need to worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I must attend the Smith family's banquet. Besides, given the current situation, staying away isn't really an option.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, I can promise you this, Aunt Carolyn. The Evil Spirit Legion won't find any foothold in Yoland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they don't show up, fine. But if they do, I'll take them down one by one, pair by pair!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was hoping the Evil Spirit Legion would show up. It would make things so much easier!</span></p></div>
