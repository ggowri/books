        <h1>Chapter 185 Submit or Die</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it all!" Anthony cursed inwardly as he struggled to make a decision. He couldn't waste time dealing with Mordred's charge. Instead, he channeled his power into the vine beneath his feet, causing it to explode and launch all three of them higher into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had to break through&mdash;there was no other choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mordred's return meant the other three Demon Lords couldn't be far behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on his earlier fight with </span><span>Necros</span><span>, Anthony knew he might be able to force Mordred back into a desperate battle, but it would take precious time they didn't have.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Breaking through their lines was their only shot at survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not getting away!" Mordred's voice boomed through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But their escape attempt was cut short. As they made their second jump, an </span><span>ear-splitting roar shattered the air around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A devastating blast of energy surged toward them from behind, sending chills down Anthony's spine. He didn't need to look back to know Mordred was right on their tail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His speed is insane," Anthony thought, shocked by how quickly their pursuer had closed the gap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With death breathing down his neck, Anthony had no time for hesitation. He let out a thunderous roar that sounded more dragon than human as power surged through his body. His bones cracked and popped as his limbs swelled with raw strength, transforming before their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Dragon Avatar!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's power exploded at its peak, launching him skyward like a mighty dragon taking flight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the </span><span>split second</span><span> Anthony dodged, Mordred's thunderous attack crashed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His devastating kick slammed into the supposedly indestructible cliff face, instantly shattering the solid rock and leaving a footprint several inches deep. The raw power behind that single kick was terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the settling dust, Mordred paused, looking up with surprise. "Well, well," he said, "looks like I underestimated you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been confident that kick would either kill Anthony outright or at least seriously injure him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that Anthony had managed to dodge it completely caught him off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Mordred didn't let his surprise slow him down. In one fluid motion, he flipped forward through the air, grabbing the red spear that was embedded in the cliff face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using the weapon as leverage, he launched himself upward, yanking the spear free as he went.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time he finished this sequence of moves, though, Anthony had already put significant distance between them, hovering well over a hundred feet away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of the Dragon Avatar was truly incredible. Anthony's limbs had become as strong as forged steel, allowing him to effortlessly punch handholds into the sheer rock face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scaled the cliff at an unbelievable speed, not even needing the vines for support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Holy shit!" someone gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way that's possible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I seeing things?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is he even human? Nobody can move that fast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd stood slack-</span><span>jawed,</span><span> their heads tilted back as they watched Anthony's impossible ascent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, Metahumans were known to possess extraordinary abilities, but this level of power was beyond anything a normal person could comprehend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This can't be real!" Anne's hysterical screams cut through the air. "There's no way Anthony is this powerful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was having trouble processing what she was seeing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her mind, Anthony had always been worthless&mdash;weak, useless, a nobody.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he have transformed into someone so incredibly powerful?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disconnect between her perception and reality was too much for her to handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mordred pursued Anthony relentlessly along the cliff's edge, somehow moving even faster than Anthony despite his enhanced dragon power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony sprinted across the thousand-foot cliff face and, upon reaching the summit, dove straight into the forest without a moment's hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dragon power had transformed his legs, making his muscles bulge noticeably larger than normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His speed was almost beyond imagination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what made Anthony's blood run cold was the fact that Mordred wasn't just keeping up&mdash;he was actually gaining ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's mind raced. What kind of opponent was he facing? Though Mordred was clearly a Level B Warrior, he possessed strength that left Anthony in the dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had to be the Blood Shadow technique. That fighting style was clearly more formidable than Anthony had anticipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Anthony could think further, Mordred launched himself through the air and landed directly in Anthony's path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his hands, he wielded a crimson spear that glowed with an eerie blood-red light, radiating dangerous power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony skidded to a stop, his eyes hardening with a deadly intensity he'd never shown before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keeping his gaze locked on Mordred, he carefully set Rose and Carolyn down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, without a sound, he gripped </span><span>Dragonfang</span><span> in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mordred let out a cold laugh. "I must admit, your talents are impressive. Your power is... remarkable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're nothing like the 'worthless fool' they described," he continued, his voice dripping with condescension. "</span><span>So</span><span> I'm willing to make you an offer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pledge your loyalty to </span><span>Archlord</span><span> </span><span>Iscairn</span><span>, and I'll not only spare your life but also guarantee the safety of the Turner family. With your abilities, you're more than qualified to lead them. </span><span>Archlord</span><span> </span><span>Iscairn</span><span> will place all of Yoland under your control."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your past won't matter. Swear allegiance to us, and you'll rise to power</span><span> </span><span>instantly&mdash;answering to only one while commanding thousands. You have nowhere to run. Submission is your only option."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mordred stood there, looking down at Anthony with an air of superiority, clearly expecting him to kneel in gratitude.</span></p></div>
