        <h1>Chapter 58 Such Deep Love</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A middle-aged woman, entirely shrouded in black, walked slowly into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her skin was smooth, and her petite frame seemed frail, as if a gust of wind could topple her. Yet, the oppressive aura emanating from her struck fear into everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Anthony had never seen her before, he instinctively knew&mdash;this was Carolyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was the leader of the Turner family, Rose's aunt, and the one whose power loomed over the estate like a shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A woman capable of managing such a massive entity as the Turner family, it was clear just how formidable she was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony had already felt her imposing presence earlier, even from behind closed doors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, seeing her in person, his heart raced uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Greetings, Ms. Carolyn Turner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Greetings, Ms. Carolyn Turner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Led by Alvin and Anne, the crowd collectively bowed, their voices loud and synchronized, creating an awe-inspiring scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Carolyn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent stepped forward first, calling out respectfully. "Aunt Carolyn, Anthony is of lowly status and deliberately approached Rose. He used a ruse to win her trust, harboring sinister motives. His crimes are unforgivable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rose, being young and naive, was deceived by him. Her behavior has been improper, disgracing the Turner family. I ask you to uphold the family's honor by executing Anthony immediately and confining Rose to study family rules as punishment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His reasoning was forceful and persuasive, winning nods of approval from many in the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's already icy expression grew colder. Her sharp gaze landed on Anthony </span><span>before shifting to Rose, where it settled on their tightly clasped hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without saying a word, the intensity of her glare made Rose feel as though needles were pricking her skin. Panicking, Rose quickly let go of Anthony's hand. "Aunt Carolyn, please, let me explain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need," Carolyn interrupted curtly. Fixing her piercing gaze on Anthony, she said sternly, "Young man, if you leave now, I will let bygones be bygones and spare your life. But if you insist on staying, the wager we made still stands. Find the true culprit before the banquet ends, or you will take your own life before Rose."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" Rose exclaimed, her voice anxious. "Aunt Carolyn, Anthony was just speaking out of frustration! Investigating the real culprit is no small task, how could he possibly accomplish it in such a short time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn sneered. "Anthony, those were your words."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony raised his voice. "That's right, they were. But don't forget, Carolyn, if I succeed, you made a promise to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's tone turned icy. "I always keep my word. If you win, you may pursue Rose. I won't interfere with your relationship again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Rose gasped, her expression a mixture of surprise and joy. "Anthony, so you risked all of this for me? You're crazy! Are you really willing to gamble your life?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony took her hand, his smile calm yet firm. "If the reward is worth it, no risk is too great."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heartfelt confession brought tears to Rose's eyes. She was deeply moved yet filled with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Biting her lip, she declared, "I believe in you! You can do it! Whatever you ask of me after this, I'll do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her impassioned response left the crowd stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What many had assumed was Anthony's one-sided pursuit turned out to be mutual, unwavering affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a love that defied expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent, his eyes red with fury, roared, "Anthony! Who is the real culprit? If you can't name them now, then kill yourself immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony turned to Carolyn, his voice steady. "Shall we begin?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's face remained stoic as she replied coldly, "The banquet has started. The wager is in effect. Rose, come with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Carolyn's strict order, Rose had no choice but to take her seat beside her aunt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With all the guests seated, the banquet began. Yet no one touched their food; every eye remained fixed on Anthony, waiting to see how he would investigate the case.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent sneered. "Well? Let's see what you've got, Anthony. I can't wait to see your head roll."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel, his expression tense, whispered to Anthony, "Do you have a plan? Any leads at all?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony responded calmly, "Ms. Turner's outings are always under strict security. Yet the moment she left Dragon Guild, there was no one to escort her, giving the assassin their opportunity. My first suspect is... the head of security, Dariel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Dariel's eyes widened in shock. He forced a bitter smile. "I've already </span><span>explained. I was delayed by other matters..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony interrupted firmly. "What could be more important than Ms. Turner's safety? Dariel, if you're innocent, explain yourself clearly in front of everyone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking into Anthony's authoritative gaze, Dariel suddenly understood that Anthony was not only investigating the case but also giving himself an opportunity to clear his name in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a determined expression, Dariel raised his voice. "That day, I was scheduled to lead a team to Dragon Guild to escort Ms. Turner back. But Mr. Vincent Turner informed me of an urgent matter at the mines that required immediate attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He assured me that he would assign someone else to handle Ms. Turner's escort. Acting on his instructions, I prioritized the mine issue. I never expected that Mr. Vincent Turner wouldn't arrange for anyone to pick up Ms. Turner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his words echoed through the hall, all eyes turned to Vincent, suspicion growing rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps Vincent's repeated attempts to obstruct Anthony's investigation were because he had deliberately orchestrated the assassin's opportunity.</span></p></div>
