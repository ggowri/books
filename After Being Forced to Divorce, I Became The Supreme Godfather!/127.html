        <h1>Chapter 126 No Rest Until Death</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Zodiac?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's interest was piqued, but Seraph paused deliberately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Anthony's impatient look, he continued, "The day before yesterday, they went on a rampage, taking down several security companies one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, just like challenging martial arts schools, they went from one to the next, beating them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The next day, they made a big show of establishing Draconic Shield."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But here's the kicker, the heads of those defeated security companies personally went to congratulate him..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur was indeed one of a kind. Only he could come up with such a plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Starting a security company by taking down another one... what a genius!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Anthony wasn't too concerned about that. Instead, he asked, "What about the situation in the Virstino Mountains? Any leads?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But we were wrong in our initial assumption.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The werewolf assassin you caught admitted he was from the Evil Spirit Legion's Southwest Camp and trained in the Virstino Mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That led us to believe the Southwest Camp was in the Virstino Mountains, but that's not the case.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our investigation shows only minimal Evil Spirit Legion activity in the Virstino Mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I later contacted Arthur, who confirmed several locations where they previously trained and hid out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To put it simply, while the Evil Spirit Legion had people hiding in the Virstino Mountains, the Southwest Camp itself isn't located there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And currently, there's almost no trace of the Evil Spirit Legion in the Virstino Mountains. They've either gone deep underground or left altogether."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three days had been enough time for Seraph to investigate the situation at Virstino Mountains thoroughly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, these findings weren't what Anthony had been hoping for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Seraph had mentioned, Anthony had expected to make some significant discoveries in the Virstino Mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd specifically warned Seraph to be careful, thinking there would be a large concentration of Evil Spirit Legion members there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, they were entirely off base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had all their efforts been for nothing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something wasn't right!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of deep thought, Anthony spoke up. "Based on what you're saying, has the Evil Spirit Legion given up on the Turner family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not like them to throw in the towel so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, the Evil Spirit Legion took quite a hit in the battle with the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They lost a bunch of assassins and their Virstino Mountains operation was exposed. Why would they just walk away from all that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well..." Seraph hesitated, at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's concern wasn't unfounded. The Evil Spirit Legion lived by one notorious motto. "No rest until death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw Seraph was speechless, Anthony let out a chuckle and waved his hand. "Alright, don't get too hung up on the Evil Spirit Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Having you investigate early was just a precautionary measure. It's great if you find something, but no big deal if you don't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since the Evil Spirit Legion never gives up, they're bound to make another move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what we need to do is actually quite simple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait and watch, let them walk right into our trap."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um..." Seraph looked confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Johnson, what do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony smiled wryly and explained, "Anne has not only rallied various families to her side, but she's also planning a grand banquet to announce her allegiance to the Evil Spirit Legion, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just imagine, if you were the Evil Spirit Legion, would you miss such a golden opportunity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone publicly pledging allegiance to an evil force... that's never happened before. The Evil Spirit Legion will definitely send someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So all we need to do is wait patiently for them to come to us. Get it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph paused for a moment before breaking into a flirtatious giggle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh Mr. Johnson, you're so brilliant at both strategy and combat. I'm absolutely crazy about you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go away!" Anthony waved his hand in disgust as Seraph tried to grab his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cut that out! Just keep your eyes peeled and let me know the second anything happens."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Johnson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfazed, Seraph grinned and latched onto his arm again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her generous assets pressed against him shamelessly, making his blood boil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony had planned to stop by the Dragon Guild, but Seraph's antics had put him in such a foul mood that he decided to head straight to the Turner family instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That bastard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Screw him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing but trash talk from that lowlife!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A worthless piece of garbage, talking big like that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, at the Smith family residence, Anne nearly smashed her phone after hanging up, cursing up a storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't stand Anthony's condescending tone and the way he'd dismissed her ultimately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after everything that had happened, she still saw him as nothing but a worthless fool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give it a rest," Alvin said lazily from his spot on the couch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why waste your energy on a dead man walking?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In three days, Anthony better not show his face. If he dares to come, he's as good as dead!"</span></p></div>
