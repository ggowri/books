        <h1>Chapter 75 Werewolves' Formation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone said, "Captain Stein, please retreat first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another said, "Let's go! Kill these beasts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Dariel was about to faint, the Turner family's reinforcements arrived in time, someone protecting Dariel and the others rushing towards the werewolves without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, a large number of werewolves also appeared in the distant corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolf army was coming with great force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From all directions, they rushed over while howling, at least dozens of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, the howling of wolves sounded everywhere and was terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The murderous aura spread in every direction, almost covering half of the Turner Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them!" Outside the gate, the Turner Guards were horrified, but they all raised their arms in unison and stood in formation in a fight-to-the-death attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On top of the Turner Manor's high walls, bursts of fire were flying, and bullets were flying towards them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family had seen how ferocious werewolves were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of werewolves were attacking, so the Turner family no longer held back and went all out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolves were not afraid of the Turner family's firepower, but instead aroused a brutal beast nature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With terrifying roars, dozens of werewolves, regardless of the dense bullets, rushed madly toward the Turner Guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner Guards still fought desperately to stop them and refused to give in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a while, the two sides fought back and forth. Blood spurted, and dust filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tragic wails resounded everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The banquet hall was full of guests, but there was dead silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's eyes were focused on the screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bloody and brutal scene made many of them feel cold and tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason is missing." Rose frowned and ordered, "Switch the surveillance of the north gate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the north gate, dust rose, and sand filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn, wrapped in the sand, fought against more than thirty werewolves on her own through the diffuse dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone exclaimed, "Wow! As expected of Ms. Carolyn Turner, she has such strong fighting ability."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another said, "Of course. She is a Level C elemental metahuman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The screen flickered, and the crowd exclaimed in amazement. Everyone had just witnessed the power of the werewolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than a dozen werewolves almost broke through the Turner Manor's main gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Carolyn was fighting against more than a dozen werewolves on her own and was not at a disadvantage. Her power was terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose breathed a sigh of relief at seeing that Carolyn was safe and sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anthony frowned because Mason was nowhere to be seen while Carolyn was fighting with the werewolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony thought, "He's not at the main gate nor the north gate. Where could he be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!" While Anthony was thinking, outside the north gate, Carolyn shouted and waved a giant yellow sand sword in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a few loud bangs, the giant sword carried an unrivaled momentum, sweeping across the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gathered werewolves were instantly torn apart and flew dozens of feet away, wailing. After they landed on the ground, their bodies were covered in blood and flesh, and they utterly died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn killed a dozen werewolves in a single second with a single stroke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone said, "Great! Ms. Carolyn Turner is too powerful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another said, "Ms. Carolyn Turner is indeed a heroine. I admire her so much. With her guarding the Turner Manor, the werewolves will never set foot in the Turner Manor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the banquet hall, the crowd cheered excitedly, and their previous worries were entirely replaced by excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless of the others, Carolyn's fighting power was almost invincible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, what did they have to worry about?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, no one knew what price Carolyn had paid for killing a dozen werewolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If there were only a dozen werewolves, they would not be enough to make Carolyn desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in her haste to get here, she had been caught off guard by the werewolves' trick and trapped in a strange formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolves' formation was bizarre and extremely powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn had never seen it before, so she had fought tooth and nail after being trapped in the formation before getting out of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To others, she just fought against a dozen werewolves alone. But in fact, she had also broken the werewolves' formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after breaking the formation, Carolyn was exhausted, and all the strength in her body was almost used up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the werewolves were killed. Carolyn breathed a sigh of relief, straightened her back, and turned her head back, casting a reassuring glance at the surveillance probe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew well that it was necessary to stabilize the family's spirit and boost morale when the enemy was at the gates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how exhausted she was, she would not show any sign of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just when she was relaxing, she heard the howling of wolves again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn was shocked and looked back subconsciously, and her expression changed drastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From an alley not far away, werewolves jumped out one after another, and there were </span><span>at least thirty of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone said, "What? There are so many werewolves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another said, "How could that be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the banquet hall, the excited guests seemed to be poured with cold water, and they were all dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great! Let's see how she can stop them this time." In the crowd, Alvin smiled coldly and muttered with gloat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" Rose was distraught. After she angrily scolded him, she didn't want to pay any more attention to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the gate, Carolyn, who was at the end of her strength, couldn't help but curse inwardly, "Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "How could I, exhausted as I am, fight against dozens of werewolves?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as the person in charge of the Turner family, I cannot retreat, not even a single step. Not only must I not retreat, but I must take the initiative to attack."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Carolyn thought of this, a strong wind suddenly blew all over her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she leaped forward, with the yellow sand all over the sky, and rushed towards the werewolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolves were filled with murderous intent, baring their teeth, and pounced on Carolyn from all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Carolyn was alone and outnumbered, and the werewolves instantly overwhelmed Carolyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was only dust and sand filling the sky, but there was no trace of Carolyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the banquet hall, Rose and the Turner family were all worried about Carolyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were too many werewolves, and Carolyn was alone.</span></p></div>
