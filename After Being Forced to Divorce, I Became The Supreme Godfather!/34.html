        <h1>Chapter 33 Into the Inferno</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chilling realization dawned on Anthony, compelling him to reassess the dire circumstances unfolding around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused to himself, "Could they really be here just to kill me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To take me out, would they really muster such an overwhelming force?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he doubted that any underworld gang possessed the clout to cordon off an entire block, let alone jam all communication signals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze shifted to Rose, a dreadful suspicion taking root.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook off the thought as quickly as it came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family, the sole nobility in Yoland, wielded unmatched power. Rose, with her beauty, kindness, and unparalleled medical prowess, was the anointed heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would dare move against her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He preferred to believe that these adversaries were after him alone, not Rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen, gripped by the adrenaline of a situation she'd never faced before, clutched the steering wheel and cried out, "Anthony, what's our next move?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony snapped back to focus. "Take the shortcut! Just keep driving forward. I'll handle the rest!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless of the enemy's true intent, Anthony knew he had to clear his mind, focus, and navigate through this perilous moment. If not, it wouldn't matter who they were targeting; he would meet his end tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen, relying on sheer instinct, veered the SUV onto a narrow path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From every direction, compact cars devoid of license plates swarmed towards their SUV, reminiscent of a school of piranhas closing in for the kill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every now and then, a sniper would emerge from a car's roof, and if they ventured even slightly closer, he wouldn't hesitate to pull the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bullets whizzed towards Anthony, one after another, like spectral harvesters of souls in the dead of night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone with even slightly lesser abilities would have been riddled with bullets by now. Fortunately for Anthony, he had the assistance of the Devil Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Devil Eye's calculations and alerts, Anthony needed only to exert minimal effort and move the optimal distance to evade each bullet with precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His retaliatory fire was merciless, silencing the gunmen one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the SUV distanced itself from the urban sprawl, it transitioned onto a quieter suburban road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen exclaimed with excitement, "If we take this route, we'll hit the main road to Turner Manor. Once we're there, those killers wouldn't dare follow, no matter how bold they are!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her foot pressed down, the engine roaring with newfound vigor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This ordeal was unprecedented for Rose, who, since birth, had never encountered such peril. Her face was ashen, and she repeatedly urged, "Anthony, are you alright? Please, be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's upper body protruded through the sunroof, serving as a vigilant watchtower, scanning for threats ahead, behind, and on either flank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He resembled a general at the helm of his central army, exclaiming with high spirits, "Don't worry. We'll be safe soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No sooner had he spoken than the air was split by the scream of incoming artillery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony couldn't afford to glance behind as the Devil Eye began to signal frantically. "Rocket attack from the rear!" Urgent warning! Immediate danger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rocket!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never anticipated that the opposition would resort to deploying something as formidable as rockets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, the target wasn't him; it was the rugged off-road vehicle he was navigating through the terrain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he managed to dodge, Helen and Rose, still inside the car, would surely be shattered to pieces as the vehicle erupted into a fiery oblivion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that heart-stopping moment, his eyes caught sight of an abandoned castle to the left. With urgency cracking his voice, he shouted, "Quick, head left!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen's nerves were strung tight as a bow. Hearing his command, she yanked the </span><span>steering wheel almost on instinct. The SUV, like a wild beast unleashed, smashed through the decrepit gate and barreled into the castle's forsaken courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barely had they halted when a rocket detonated where they'd been, the blast wave rocking the world around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose, thrown by the force, landed in Anthony's embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony watched as the pursuing vehicles closed in. In haste, he wrapped his arms around Rose and screamed, "Helen, jump out now! Get to the room!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clutching Rose, he leaped from the vehicle and dashed towards the room ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They barely made it inside when another rocket found the SUV.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With an earth-shattering explosion, the SUV was catapulted into the air, only to crash down as a twisted heap of scrap metal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trio, huddled in the room, witnessed the destruction. Their faces paled, hearts pounding with terror at the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had they hesitated even a moment longer, they would've been reduced to nothing but ashes in the wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over a dozen chase cars screeched into the yard, doors flung open, and out leaped killers, fully armed, brandishing submachine guns with menacing intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do we do now?" Rose trembled with fear. "There's too many of them! We can't hold out here for long!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony let out a breath, steadying himself. "Don't be afraid," he said with a reassuring calm, "Leave it to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clutched the M9 Micro Submachine Gun firmly in one hand, inhaled deeply, and suddenly rolled, sliding across the ground with a fighter's grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he rolled, a burst of bullets erupted from his gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't even need to aim. Guided by the Devil Eye, each bullet he fired was a death knell, unerring and lethal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the distance, several killers dropped instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the enemy was numerous, closing in around Anthony with weapons that matched his own in lethality.</span></p></div>
