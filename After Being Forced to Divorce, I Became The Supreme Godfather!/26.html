        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ding!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Storage completed. Based on this newly acquired knowledge, you now have the ability to deduce advanced concepts in the field of spiritual medicine..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's heart surged with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until now, his understanding of the Devil Eye's capabilities had been woefully inadequate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this revelation opened a new horizon. In the future, he could absorb vast amounts of knowledge, feeding it into the Devil Eye. As its reservoir of information grew, so too would its deductive prowess, becoming ever more powerful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, absorbing such a massive amount of data in such a short span of time had its drawbacks. The spiritual energy of the Devil Eye depleted rapidly, leaving Anthony feeling slightly dizzy. Bidding farewell to Helen, he retreated to his room to hasten his recovery, practicing the Energy-absorbing Breathing to restore his energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Anthony accompanied Rose to the auction hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire group had already assembled, including Alvin and Anne, who were waiting impatiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Anne laid eyes on Anthony, a simmering anger bubbled within her. Memories of </span><span>the previous night, when she had been forced to disrobe in the wooden cabin and ultimately rejected by him, resurfaced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she masked her fury, offering Anthony a sly, meaningful glance. He nodded in response, which fueled her secretive triumph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was convinced that her performance the night before, an artful exhibition of her own anguish, had truly resonated with Anthony. Now, she could almost visualize the scene where he unknowingly ventured deeper into the delicate snare she had laid out with such precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She murmured, "Just you wait.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Soon, Rose will turn against you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When that happens, you'll be worthless, but you'll still kneel before me, begging to be my slave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others in the room cast hostile glances toward Anthony as well, though they remained silent, cowed by Rose's presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony and Rose took their seats in the private diamond members' section.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the host stepped onto the stage and briefly outlined the rules, the auction commenced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One peculiar item after another was paraded before the audience, with bids ranging from 100,000 dollars to as high as 10 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the lively atmosphere, there was a strange lack of fervor. Most attendees seemed content to spectate, waiting for something truly valuable to appear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose sat with an air of calm detachment, as if the outcome of the auction held no real sway over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt an irresistible urge to return home, to sit with Anthony and hear more about his tragic yet fascinating childhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing his intense focus on the stage, she couldn't resist the urge to inquire, "Is there anything you like? I can bid for it and gift it to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony smiled, "What I'm waiting for hasn't appeared yet. But the next item up for auction is mine. I wonder how much it will fetch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your item?" Rose's brows arched in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The host's voice boomed through the hall, "Lot 903, a classic submachine gun developed by the Godfather Research Institute: the M9. Equipped with two magazines and 200 special bullets, the starting price is 50,000 dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fifty thousand dollars?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A heavy silence followed the host's announcement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose gaped at Anthony in curiosity. "Your item is an M9 submachine gun, with two magazines and 200 rounds of ammunition? And the starting price is 50,000 dollars?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony frowned, anxiety threading his voice, "Is that too high?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honestly, I was just guessing. I don't really know the market value!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regret gnawed at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had purchased the gun in the Dragon Ring Store for 5,000 gold coins, with an additional 2,000 gold coins for the ammunition, a total of 7,000 gold coins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Setting the starting bid at 50,000 dollars had been a shot in the dark, and now, it seemed like he'd made a grave miscalculation. The silence in the room spoke </span><span>volumes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then Helen, standing nearby, whispered excitedly, "Products from the Godfather Research Institute never go for less than 100,000 dollars on the black market. And this classic M9 submachine gun? It could easily sell for over 500,000 dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you include the two hundred rounds of ammunition, it's not impossible to push it to one million."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's eyes widened in astonishment. "One million?" He had feared he'd overpriced the item, but now it seemed he had undervalued it drastically!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The silence in the room was due to shock at the unbelievably low starting price. Many probably thought it was a counterfeit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems you really don't know the market. But I'll help you." Rose chuckled, her eyes twinkling with amusement. Without hesitation, she raised the auction paddle and called out in a clear, confident voice, "500,000 dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of astonishment swept across the room when Rose placed her initial bid, the very first of the day, on the M9.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was completely unexpected, catching everyone off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was no secret that the M9 was powerful, but why would a refined young lady like Rose have any use for a submachine gun?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, her bid carried weight, and it signaled to everyone present that the M9 was no fake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The aura of her prestige seemed to lend credibility to the item. As if waking from a collective slumber, the room erupted into a flurry of bids.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time at all, the words "one million" echoed through the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's heart raced as the numbers climbed higher and higher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind whirred with calculations. Even after accounting for the 10% transaction fee paid to Dragon Guild, he was set to make a staggering profit of nearly 900,000 dollars!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He exclaimed, "It's nothing short of a windfall!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only he didn't have to fret over the limited stock at Dragon Ring Store or the risk of flooding the market with M9s, which could dilute the product's exclusivity, he could just flip this gun for a profit and sail into financial freedom without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One million and five hundred thousand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Anthony was lost in his daydream of wealth and success, Alvin stood near the back of the room as he shouted out the bid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One million and five hundred thousand dollars?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His bid soared half a million above the going rate on the black market!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the M9 was an exceptional weapon, this price was absurdly high. The others, though desirous, held onto their senses and ceased their bids.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't be keeping this gun for myself!" Alvin declared proudly. "I'll buy it and gift it to Ms. Turner!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, since you're so favored by Ms. Turner, shouldn't you be the one to offer her a gift? If you'd like, I can let you have this M9 for a little extra, of course.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Though I wonder can someone as poor as you afford it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony replied, "Oh, no need. This gun is my auction item, after all. I acquired it </span><span>through a special channel, and it only cost me 7,000 dollars in total. If Ms. Turner likes it, I'd be happy to give it to her myself. Thanks for letting me rake in such a haul."</span></p></div>
