        <h1>Chapter 70 Fight to the Death</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing everyone's shocked expressions, Alvin said excitedly, "Anthony, why are you still standing there? Why don't you commit suicide quickly so as not to implicate others?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The werewolf leader, Mason Foster, said that as long as you offer your head, he will let the people here go. Otherwise, they will all be dead with you. Are you going to drag them to hell with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, everyone looked at each other in panic. Someone couldn't help but say, "For the benefit of everyone, we can sacrifice Anthony."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another woman said, "Anthony, don't implicate us. We don't want to be dead with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another man said excitedly, "The werewolf killers of the Evil Spirit Legion are out in large numbers, and they are unstoppable. Anthony, commit suicide and apologize now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose hadn't expected that these people were so shameless. They had been trying to curry favor with Anthony just now, but they were taking advantage of her misfortune now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up." She said angrily, "You are going too far. The Evil Spirit Legion is ruthless and is our common enemy. We must unite and fight against them together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fight against the Evil Spirit Legion? Although everyone did not dare to refute Rose, they all showed disdain and dared not go against the army of evil spirits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They dared not even think about such a crazy idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that no one dared to contradict Rose, Anne snorted coldly, crossing her arms, "Ms. Turner, you are so young and have just inherited the position of successor of your family. Do you really want to ruin your future for a loser like Anthony? If I were </span><span>you, I would immediately offer Anthony to werewolves, make friends with werewolves, and expand my influence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose was furious and gritted her teeth. "Anthony is right. You are a shameless bitch. As a woman, I think you are embarrassing all women."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never scolded someone so harshly before, especially when the other person was also a woman, but she did it today in public, which showed that she was furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose continued, "You can sell your soul and body for vanity and profit. But I, Rose, won't. I declare now that I will firmly defend Anthony's safety as long as I am still alive. If you want to kill him, you have to step over my dead body."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing such a powerful voice from a delicate woman like Rose, everyone was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose was gentle on the outside but firm on the inside. She was indeed a top-notch woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In comparison, Rose was a phoenix rising from the ashes, while Anne was like a dirty chicken on the roadside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was very moved. He hadn't expected Rose to protect him so domineeringly in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt more and more that he had found his soulmate and secretly vowed to protect her well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne was extremely ashamed. Unlike before, when she had to be a coward, she had the werewolf killer as her backer now and felt that she could be on equal footing with Rose and even Carolyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Since you are still stubborn and want to go against the Evil Spirit Legion for a bastard like Anthony, just wait for your entire family to be wiped out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin also sneered, "What a pity. Ms. Turner, you just took over as the successor today and are going to ruin the future of the Turner family now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, listen up. Mr. Foster orders you to walk out within three minutes, surrender to the Evil Spirit Legion, and declare your loyalty. Otherwise, you will be regarded as Anthony's accomplices and will be killed without mercy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although everyone admired Rose's integrity, they were terrified when it came to their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't want to surrender and pledge allegiance to the Evil Spirit Legion because their lives and even all their property would no longer belong to them once they joined the Evil Spirit Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That way, everything they had would be dominated by the Evil Spirit Legion, so they could only look at Carolyn anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone whispered, "Ms. Carolyn Turner, please take charge of the situation. For the benefit of everyone, you can sacrifice Anthony."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another man said, "Yes, Ms. Carolyn Turner. Ms. Turner is young and ignorant. As the acting head of the Turner family, you must put the overall situation first. You must not sacrifice our collective interests for the sake of Anthony."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another woman said, "Ms. Carolyn Turner, you deliberately announced that Anthony was a killer in order to protect the interests of the Turner family, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Carolyn Turner, hurry up and kill Anthony to save everyone," said those guests </span><span>in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough." Carolyn could no longer bear it and shouted angrily, "You cowards, you are bringing shame to the celebrities of Yoland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before, due to a misunderstanding, I offended Mr. Johnson. Now, Mr. Johnson's character and strength have won my respect. He is a guest of honor in the Turner family and a great benefactor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I, as the acting head of the family, declare that I fully support the decision of the heir Rose. The Turner family will use all its strength to defend Mr. Johnson's safety and fight all invading enemies to the end."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her soul-stirring speech resounded throughout the audience, like a drumbeat of war beating in everyone's hearts, and many people showed a look of shame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared with Carolyn and Rose, they really had no integrity and backbone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin was angry and pointed at Carolyn. "Ms. Carolyn Turner, we have already told you what we should. Please think carefully. If you insist on being stubborn, we will report to Mr. Foster and ask him to launch an attack immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn roared, "I don't need you two to report anything. Listen to me, you bastards outside. I am Carolyn, the acting head of the Turner family. I'm giving you a chance now. Retreat immediately and promise never to offend the Turner family again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, I will protect Mr. Johnson and the interests of the Turner family to the death and fight you to the end."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was like the shout of a phoenix and the roar of a dragon, shaking the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, as the wind suddenly arose, the yellow sand gathered and formed a huge yellow sword in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most powerful woman in Yoland who was in charge of the Turner family, showed her full strength now and was ready to fight to the death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the atmosphere was solemn, and the war was imminent.</span></p></div>
