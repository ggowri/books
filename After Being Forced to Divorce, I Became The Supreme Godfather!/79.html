        <h1>Chapter 78 Cowardice</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"West gate? How many werewolves are there in total?" Rose was shocked and asked while supporting the guard who was about to fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, she just ignored Anne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"More than thirty. Mason is attacking the gate himself, and we can't stop him." The guard was seriously injured. He said it in a trembling voice and then fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Make a feint to the east but attack in the west?" muttered Rose and looked at Anthony subconsciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go." Anthony became serious and ordered Jane, "Ms. Ronald, please protect Ms. Turner. I'm going to meet Mason."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolves were coming with great and unstoppable force. Carolyn had even </span><span>gone into battle personally. How could Anthony just stand by and watch?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No. Mr. Johnson, you can't." Jane said, "The werewolves came for you. Perhaps he is attracting your action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason is just a werewolf leader. Let me go. We will feel at ease if you protect Ms. Turner personally."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, Jane felt at ease only when Anthony was in the Turner Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If anything happened to Anthony, she couldn't afford it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. Be careful. Mason is difficult." Anthony gave Jane a warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." Jane nodded and led a group of Dragon Guards to charge towards the west gate with great momentum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dragon Group regarded maintaining world peace as its responsibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, evil existences such as the Evil Spirit Legion had long been on the blacklist of the Dragon Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would kill one if they saw one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Anthony sat down again, Anne said disdainfully, "You coward, do you only let women protect you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, you are such a jinx.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are the one who the werewolves came to, but you dare not go out to fight it. You just hide behind a woman like a coward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you strong? Why don't you kill the werewolves yourself? Coward. You're a complete coward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, you saw it, right? The Turner family is trying so hard to protect such a coward. It's simply hilarious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne seized the opportunity finally. She looked at Anthony arrogantly and did her utmost to belittle him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that only in this way could everyone understand how wise it was for her to divorce Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anthony didn't even look at her and just stared at the screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, the screen was divided into three parts, showing the surveillance of the west gate, where the battle was already very tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolves came well-prepared and in large numbers. In the beginning, there were more than thirty guards of the Turner family at the west gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, there were less than ten left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground was covered with blood, and bloody bodies were lying in front of the gate, which was horrible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, there were still more than thirty werewolves left, so the guards couldn't hold on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them, my kids." Not far away, Mason occupied the high ground, raised his arms, and shouted, "Destroy the Turner Manor and capture Rose alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the command, the werewolves launched another fierce attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of werewolves madly rushed forward, unstoppable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane led her men and saw the blood all over the ground. She could not help but curse and waved her hand, saying, "Damn it! Go and eradicate the werewolves for our people."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them." Without Jane's order, dozens of Dragon Guards rushed forward at the first moment, shouting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dragon Guard were not only numerous but also much stronger than the guards of the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their participation, the unstoppable werewolves were stopped once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before they could breathe a sigh of relief, the werewolves who had been lying in ambush in the distance rushed over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of werewolves came running from all directions. For a moment, the dust was rising, and the sound was terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Mason, in the corner, retreated quietly again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the banquet hall, Anthony was stunned for a moment and thought, "What a cunning werewolf!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He feinted an attack on the south gate, then focused on the north gate, and then turned to the west gate. Now, it's time for the east gate, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this thought, Anthony sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he was about to say something, Alvin sneered, "Anthony, who can save you next?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I were you, I would have committed suicide long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So many members of the Turner family died because of you. Do you have a conscience?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you are still a man, you'd better fight the werewolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about letting us see your power, Mr. Johnson?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolf army was approaching, and the Turner family was in danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anthony remained silent, which was a sign of cowardice in the eyes of Alvin and Anne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it?" Anthony turned to stare at Alvin with a meaningful smile and asked, "Aren't you very clear whether I am a man or not?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And, if I remember correctly, you're not a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The screen here is big enough. How about I play that video again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You! How dare you!" Hearing this, Alvin instantly became furious and angrily cursed, "Anthony, you coward. I'm telling you. You're doomed today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The werewolves will rush in and tears you into pieces soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The video Anthony mentioned was the one that Alvin hated to the core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alvin hadn't been concerned about Anthony's strength, he would have killed him with his own hands.</span></p></div>
