        <h1>Chapter 66 A Little Upset</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unfortunate for the family. Thankfully, Mr. Johnson came to our aid, and Ms. Ronald personally delivered the true culprit, resolving a great threat to the Turner family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I, Carolyn, along with the heir, Rose, and all 400 members of the Turner family, thank Mr. Johnson and Ms. Ronald for their immense kindness!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please accept our gratitude!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's voice rang out with heartfelt gratitude as she spoke before she firmly grasped Rose's hand and, with a solemn expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, she had harbored hostility towards Anthony, displeased with Jane, and even went so far as to accuse Anthony of being the killer, calling for his execution throughout the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with the truth revealed, Carolyn had come to respect Anthony for his ability and courage. She was willing to admit her mistakes and in a rare display of humility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was an unprecedented act in the Turner family and even in Yoland's history. It also demonstrated Carolyn's maturity and her ability to put the bigger picture first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gesture of integrity and courage earned the respect of both Anthony and Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quickly, they stepped back. "Ms. Carolyn Turner, Ms. Turner, please don't say this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose, delighted, helped Carolyn rise. "Aunt Carolyn, Anthony and Jane aren't outsiders. Don't be so polite. Can we start eating now? I'm starving."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Rose, normally composed, revealed a rare playful side, as if she were a mischievous teenager.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn frowned slightly and scolded, "You're twenty now. From this point on, you must carry yourself as the heir to the Turner family. Be mindful of your image, especially in front of so many people!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose stuck out her tongue. "Got it! Anthony, let's go eat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took Anthony's hand and started walking toward the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony laughed. "Wait a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Carolyn Turner, this werewolf killer is a gift from Jane and me. We'll leave it to you to handle. He has special drugs injected into him by the Evil Spirit Legion, enhancing his mutation and explosive abilities. I'm sure this will be useful to the Turner family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's face lit up with excitement. "Thank you! This gift is invaluable. Mr. Johnson, your righteousness is something I will not decline!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone, take this werewolf to my laboratory. No one is allowed near him without my orders!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family, a medical family, had been researching substances that could enhance human abilities, making the drugs inside the werewolf's body extremely valuable to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, Carolyn hesitated to speak up because she believed that since Jane and Anthony had captured the werewolf, they would surely extract the drugs from his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Anthony had mentioned that his cooperation with the Dragon Group was part of testing a new type of drug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Anthony had gone above and beyond, directly offering this remarkable specimen to the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that the drugs Anthony had been using were far more advanced than what the werewolf had consumed. The werewolf's drug samples no longer held much value </span><span>to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood!" Dariel waved his hand and personally led a team to take the werewolf away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Rose had seated herself with Anthony, persistently serving him food and pouring drinks. Unlike before, when she had been somewhat impulsive, her actions now reflected the acknowledgment of Anthony's status, not just from her but also from Carolyn, the acting head of the family. Jane was equally affectionate towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was becoming clear that their relationship was not just cordial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Anthony became the center of attention, outshining even Rose, the host of the gathering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the end of the table, Alvin and Anne could barely contain their jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had schemed for so long to rid themselves of Anthony, yet not only had they failed, but they had inadvertently elevated him to a position of honor in the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing how close he was to Rose, she felt it was possible that he might even win her heart and become Rose's husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to being a part of the Smith family, if Anthony really became a member of the Turner family, he would soar to new heights!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne and Alvin would forever be in his shadow, struggling to curry favor with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne was once again filled with regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin, his eyes red with frustration, gritted his teeth. "No matter how glorious he looks now, in the end, he's just a man risking his life for a chance at success. Do you see how Jane is so concerned about him? That means the drug trial he's involved in is extremely dangerous. Jane's only worried about the risks of failure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if the trial succeeds, the harmful effects of such a dangerous drug will leave permanent damage on his body. He's probably already feeling the side effects, he just doesn't realize it yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I bet he won't survive the month."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne felt slightly better upon hearing this, seeing that everyone was lining up to toast Rose. She quietly whispered, "We can't lose face. Let's go pay our respects too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't miss the chance to get close to Rose and Ms. Carolyn Turner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right!" Alvin immediately raised a glass, and together with Anne, they approached Rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner, happy birthday! And congratulations on successfully taking over as the heir to the Turner family!" Anne flattered with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin nodded eagerly, "Ms. Turner, from now on, you'll be the leader of the business world in Yoland. I hope you'll keep an eye on us! We raise our glasses to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Together, they raised their glasses in respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose seemed not to have heard them. She wrapped her arm around Anthony's and said, "Anthony, I'm so happy. Are you happy too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony sneered, "I was happy earlier, but now that these two disgusting pests are here, I'm not so pleased."</span></p></div>
