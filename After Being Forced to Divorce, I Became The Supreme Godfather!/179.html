        <h1>Chapter 178 Breaking Their Spirits</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plans had changed abruptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring his injuries, Anthony quickly briefed Dariel before jumping into an SUV and heading straight for the </span><span>Virstino</span><span> Mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Crimson Canyon, Arthur arrived with his forces, cursing Anne under his breath the entire way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, a thought struck him &ndash; this might actually be the perfect opportunity to warn Anthony about some crucial information</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>He needed to tell </span><span>Anthony</span><span> </span><span>that </span><span>Vincent had four powerful Demon Lords under his command and</span><span>,</span><span> more importantly,</span><span> </span><span>Rose's location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent, ever the meticulous planner, hadn't left anything to chance. Before Arthur's departure, he'd been equipped with a wireless earpiece.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deployment wasn't just Arthur's men either&mdash;Vincent had made sure to include numerous members of the Evil Spirit Legion and his own personal guard in the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur had to admit that Vincent was meticulous in his planning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As noon approached, the roar of an engine echoed through the mountain road, growing louder with each passing moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aaron, you better not let me down!" Vincent's voice crackled through Arthur's earpiece as the engine sound drew closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trust me, Mr. Vincent Turner. Anthony's as good as dead." Though the words made him sick to his stomach, Arthur forced his voice to sound cold and ruthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep in the mine's secret chamber, Vincent laughed darkly. He turned the screen toward the cage with a sneer, "Ms. Carolyn Turner, Rose</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>Y</span><span>ou'll want to watch this.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your precious Anthony, the man you thought would save the Turner family? He's about to take his last breath."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony&mdash;" Rose cried out from behind the bars, tears streaming down her face as she watched the screen, consumed by worry and guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn stayed quiet, biting her lip, but couldn't hold back her tears either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew this mess was all on her. If only she'd listened to Anthony's warnings, if she hadn't let those damn </span><span>Leyline</span><span> cloud her judgment, none of this would've happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, Anthony was tough, but Vincent had the Four Demon Lords on his side!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of those Demon Lords could go toe-to-toe with a Level C fighter. What chance did Anthony really have?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that wasn't even counting Aaron, who was a force to be reckoned with all on his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two women felt their hearts sink deeper with each passing moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph!" Vincent smirked coldly at their reactions. This was exactly what he'd been hoping for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't dragged that massive screen into the secret chamber for nothing. This wasn't just about killing Anthony. It was about breaking their spirits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, so you think Anthony's the Turner family's savior?" he thought to himself with cruel satisfaction. "Perfect. Then you can watch him die trying to save you all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well," Anne sneered, noticing Rose's tears. "Look who's actually heartbroken!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She twisted the knife further. "Anthony's nothing but a smooth-talking loser. What else can he even do? I can't believe you fell for his sweet talk. Don't tell me you actually caught feelings for that guy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose ignored the taunts completely. Her tear-filled eyes remained fixed on the screen, desperately hoping her Anthony would prove them all wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tires screeched against the narrow mountain road of Crimson Canyon as the SUV came to a halt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right in the middle of the road sat Arthur, lounging in a single armchair with his legs crossed, looking like something straight out of a movie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight was so dramatic it caught Anthony off guard for a second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anthony was too sharp to be fooled for long. One look at Arthur's face told him everything he needed to know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh," Anthony scoffed as he stepped out of the SUV. "</span><span>So</span><span> you're Vincent's new lapdog?" His eyes blazed with killer intent as he glared at Arthur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That look sent chills down Arthur's spine, even though he knew Anthony was just putting on a show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch your mouth," Arthur sneered back. "Big talk from a dead man walking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spat out the insult, Arthur shot Anthony a subtle signal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't picked this spot just to look cool. He'd chosen it carefully. The nearby cameras could only capture his back, and while the distant ones could see his face, they weren't sharp enough to catch his subtle expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really think you can take me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony let out a cold laugh, instinctively scanning his surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When his eyes caught the security cameras, he feigned surprise, pausing for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, his gaze sharpened as he locked onto one of the cameras. "Vincent, if you're so eager to kill me, why don't you have the guts to do it yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Arthur wisely kept his mouth shut, deliberately avoiding looking at the cameras.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, Vincent's laughter boomed through the camera speakers. "Anthony, just worry about dying, would you? What does it matter if I'm there or not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, I want your head on a platter, but it doesn't mean I have to get my hands dirty to get it. Oh, and by the way, Ms. Carolyn Turner and Rose are watching your every move right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So do us all a favor, you piece of shit. Try to die gracefully. Wouldn't want to traumatize the ladies, </span><span>now</span><span> would we?" His laughter echoed again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At those words, Anthony's face turned dark as storm clouds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that split second, Arthur felt a murderous intent </span><span>that</span><span> nearly knocked him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The birds in the nearby woods scattered in panic, their wings beating frantically against the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"VINCENT!" Anthony roared. "I'M GONNA FUCKING KILL YOU!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, Anthony exploded forward. Though Vincent's name tore from his lips, it was Arthur who faced the full force of his rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Arthur nearly jumped out of his skin, but he still rushed forward without missing a beat.</span></p></div>
