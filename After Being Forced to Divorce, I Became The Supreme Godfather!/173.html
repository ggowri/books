        <h1>Chapter 172 Impossible</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sergio replied curtly, "Yes." Watching the shock written across Dariel and Abel's faces, he seemed satisfied and confirmed again, "The very Mr. Vincent Turner that we know of."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Sergio nodded, Dariel lost it, blurting out a string of curses, "No way. No fucking way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel pondered furiously, "What</span><span> happened in the Mines</span><span>? </span><span>That loser </span><span>Vincent, succeeding as the head of the Turner family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget his sketchy past or those rumors about working with the Evil Spirit Legion. </span><span>Even if he's clean, no way in hell would Ms. Carolyn Turner make him the next head of the family. Not with how he acts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abel couldn't help but frown and mutter, "Are you sure you're not mistaken, Sergio? Even if the succession ceremony is happening in the Mines, shouldn't Ms. Turner be the one taking over?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I mean, during the birthday banquet, Ms. Carolyn Turner publicly named her as the next head. How can something like that just be changed on a whim?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sergio sneered and retorted, "Your job is to follow orders. Who Ms. Carolyn Turner appoints as the next head of the family isn't something for you to question."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sergio's brush-off made Dariel's face go cold. "Cut the games, Sergio. What went down in the Mines? And Ms. Carolyn Turner's pendant - where'd you get it?" He stalked forward, voice turning deadly. "Start talking, or things get ugly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel frowned. "</span><span>This stinks</span><span>. I may be just a security captain, but I'm not stupid.</span><span> </span><span>Sergio shows up with Ms. Carolyn Turner's pendant, </span><span>and </span><span>now he's giving orders that make zero sense?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing </span><span>his</span><span> hostility rising, Sergio instinctively shrank back. "</span><span>You...</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of strength, Sergio was no match for Dariel. And he knew better than anyone that Dariel's loyalty to the Turner family was absolute. If it came down to it, Dariel wouldn't hesitate to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after a brief moment of panic, Sergio smirked and straightened up. With a hint of arrogance, he </span><span>sai</span><span>d, "Ms. Carolyn Turner's pendant is here, Dariel. </span><span>Think twice </span><span>before doing anything rash. Otherwise, your actions will amount to rebellion&mdash;an offense punishable by death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel spat on the ground and </span><span>replied</span><span>, "Rebellion? I've served the Turner family for ten years, with unwavering loyalty. </span><span>Everyone knows that!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If this really is Ms. Carolyn Turner's order, then fine. If she wants my life, she can have it. But I'm afraid this isn't her order at all. And the ones plotting treason aren't me&mdash;it's you and Vincent, isn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not too long ago, Vincent colluded with the Evil Spirit Legion, planning to assassinate Ms. Turner in secret. If it hadn't been for&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Dariel could finish, Sergio raised a hand, cutting him off with a sneer, "Enough! Watch your words, Dariel. Collusion? Mr. Vincent Turner isn't colluding with the Evil Spirit Legion. It's called cooperation. </span><span>U</span><span>nderstand? Cooperation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Sergio said that, Dariel, who had been burning with rage, suddenly froze. He wondered, "Huh? What's that supposed to mean? Did... did he just admit it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel, still in shock, demanded, "Wait, are you admitting it? And you... Are you saying </span><span>you're</span><span> part of this collusion with the Evil Spirit Legion too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel wasn't the only one floored; Abel's jaw droppe</span><span>d the second he heard it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Working with the Evil Spirit Legion? That was major. The Turners had been hunting for proof forever, and here's Sergio, confessing like he's talking about the weather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone in the crowd gasped, "</span><span>OMG</span><span>! Mr. Vincent Turner, the heir of the Turner family, also sided with </span><span>Archlord</span><span> </span><span>Iscairn</span><span>? And he's been with them for ages&mdash;way before any of us even thought about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another chimed in, "Yeah, no kidding. The Turner family heir has some serious </span><span>foresight..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone else muttered, "No wonder </span><span>Archlord</span><span> </span><span>Iscairn</span><span> said the Turner family is finished..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another added, "Such foresight. </span><span>Archlord</span><span> </span><span>Iscairn</span><span> is truly a visionary."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearby, Anne's crew was just as shocked, but they were buzzing with excitement. While Dariel and Abel stood there frozen, Anne's gang was practically high on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family had always been their biggest thorn, an insurmountable threat. But now, with Vincent joining the Evil Spirit Legion and about to become the next head of the Turner family, it felt like Christmas had come early.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sergio, however, didn't seem to care about the reactions around him. He chuckled and declared, "Well then, since it's all out in the open, let me spell it out for you. Mr. Vincent Turner has long been a part of the Evil Spirit Legion. And soon, the families of Yoland will officially join us as well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he said that, he turned his gaze toward Anne and asked, "What about you guys? Are you all going to declare your loyalty or not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?" Anne blinked in surprise but quickly recovered. Raising her arm in excitement, she shouted, "I announce that the Smith family, starting today, will officially pledge allegiance to </span><span>Archlord</span><span> </span><span>Iscairn</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From this moment forward, we swear our undying loyalty to him and vow to follow Mr. Vincent Turner's lead. We'll serve </span><span>Archlord</span><span> </span><span>Iscairn</span><span> with everything we've got!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, someone else in the crowd stepped forward. "The Blake family will also pledge allegiance to </span><span>Archlord</span><span> </span><span>Iscairn</span><span> starting today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another followed suit, declaring, "Me too! The Lewis family is with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone else stepped forward and exclaimed proudly, "And the Murphy family will gladly join as well!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Anne's declaration leading the way, the other families of Yoland scrambled to follow suit, eager to align themselves with the Evil Spirit Legion. For them, it seemed like the only option left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, the crowd erupted into cheers, shouting their oaths of loyalty. Dariel and Abel just stood there, completely dazed. It was clear this had all been premeditated. The families of Yoland had already united behind the scenes, leaving the Turner family as the ultimate target.</span></p></div>
