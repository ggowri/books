        <h1>Chapter 167 Vulnerability</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The long swords danced in the air, shattering with bursts of energy. Yet, several of them managed to slam into Malakar's body. Though the swords appeared no thicker than an arm, they carried an immense power that sent him staggering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought in shock, "A Level C elemental Metahuman! Carolyn's power isn't something ordinary at all. This technique of manipulating power from a distance is beyond Level B Metahuman's capability. Within a certain range, she can harness superpowers from afar and kill without a trace."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once all the swords were completely destroyed, Malakar, humiliated and furious, charged toward Carolyn with a roar. "Damn it! You piece of trash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately for him, before he could get close, Carolyn raised her hand in a sweeping motion. With a loud crash, yellow sand surged across the sky, blotting out the sun and stirring up violent winds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying part wasn't just the sandstorm&mdash;it was the countless swords forming within the sand. Though they were clearly made of sand, each blade emitted a sharp, chilling gleam that was nothing short of terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malakar froze mid-charge, his body trembling as his eyes widened in disbelief. "What the hell..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sand engulfed him, and the radiant swords swirled menacingly around him, hovering as if ready to tear him apart at any moment. It was crystal clear to him now&mdash;this was the terrifying power of a Level C elemental Metahuman, nothing short of extraordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn didn't hold back. Since she'd already made her move, she followed through with no hesitation. Another deafening boom resounded as her arm swept forward again. Countless swords then descended like a tidal wave, all converging on Malakar </span><span>at the center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clang&mdash;clang&mdash;clang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malakar, unwilling to be outdone, swung his sword with fierce determination. His movements were so fast and precise that the strikes created a dense, impenetrable defense. The clash of swords within the sandstorm lit up the battlefield, sending sparks flying everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent, watching from a distance, turned pale. He had always known Carolyn was powerful, but it was rare to see her in action. He never imagined that the Turner family could possess such overwhelming strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason he had such a thought was </span><span>that,</span><span> during the Evil Spirit Legion's attack on the Turner family, it had only taken a single Level B Metahuman to nearly level the place. Naturally, he assumed Carolyn couldn't be much stronger than that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent thought, "</span><span>Archlord</span><span> </span><span>Iscairn</span><span> was clear&mdash;the Four Demon Lords each possess unique skills and techniques. And yet, how is Malakar already at such a disadvantage after just one exchange?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among everyone, he was undoubtedly the most worried. He had risked everything this time. If he couldn't take down Carolyn and Rose, he'd be utterly doomed. Regret gnawed at him as he pondered, "If I'd known it would be like this, I would've never revealed myself so soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom&mdash;sword light exploded from the sandstorm, streaking out in all directions. The blades slammed into a nearby cliff, shattering the unyielding rock face. When the dust settled, deep, jagged sword marks scarred the cliffside&mdash;a chilling testament to the battle's ferocity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The road beneath their feet was already in ruins. Malakar's massive frame was nearly buried in the cracked pavement. And yet, the swords within the sandstorm continued to glow with unrelenting power, showing no signs of weakening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent was struck with a wave of dread, thinking it was all over for him. He couldn't wrap his head around it and wondered, "If Carolyn was this powerful, how had a Level B Metahuman managed to break into the Turner Manor in the first place?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he didn't know was that during the attack on the Turner family back then, Carolyn hadn't been able to assist because she'd been trapped in a formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that formation had been specifically designed for Level C Metahumans&mdash;more precisely, elemental Metahumans. After all, every strength comes with its own vulnerability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with Malakar fighting alone, he was just a Level B Warrior. How could he possibly harm a Level C elemental Metahuman? Never mind the gap in levels&mdash;even if they were the same rank, an ordinary Warrior would still struggle against an elemental Metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Vincent's worry deepened, a crimson glow flared within the swirling sandstorm&mdash;boom! In an instant, a ferocious force tore through the endless sands, scattering them into nothing more than loose grains falling to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the dust finally cleared, a towering giant over 32 feet tall</span><span> </span><span>stood proudly in the middle of the mountain road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Holy shit!" Vincent's head snapped up, his jaw dropping in shock. "What the hell is </span><span>this thing?" he wondered. "How can one person manage to block an entire mountain road?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The giant's face was grotesque, its features twisted unnaturally. Its muscles had ripped through its black clothing, bulging high like layers of jagged rock. Veins pulsed along its limbs, crisscrossing like vines in a dense forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? No way!" Carolyn gasped, her eyes widening in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew some Metahumans had the power to alter their body size, but that ability was exclusive to Metahumans. Malakar, on the other hand, was clearly a Warrior&mdash;and a Level B Warrior at that. There was simply no way a Level B Warrior could have powers that belonged to a Metahuman. For a brief moment, she was utterly dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Carolyn was frozen in shock, Vincent was over the moon. He cheered loudly, "Yes! You're incredible, Lord Malakar! Now, finish her off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his mind, he marveled, "The Dark Arts. So, this is the power </span><span>Archlord</span><span> </span><span>Iscairn</span><span> mentioned&mdash;so powerful, incredibly powerful. Joining the Evil Spirit Legion was the smartest move I've ever made. This is a guaranteed win."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After this, the Turner family will be mine to command. I'll lead them to heights no one's ever imagined</span><span>!</span><span>"</span></p></div>
