        <h1>Chapter 82 A Wise Action</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Mason smile, Alvin was overjoyed and nodded. "That's right! He is a test subject! Besides, this guy is conceited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Earlier at the banquet, Anthony had the audacity to say that he would wipe out you and your men..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Alvin was talking nonstop, Mason suddenly turned around, looked at him, and asked, "You? Who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was stunned for a moment, and his smile obviously froze, and he said with a wry smile, "Mr. Foster, it's me, Alvin, the heir of the Blake family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am your man. You just asked me to bring a message to the Turner family. Have you forgotten?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason realized and nodded subconsciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin was overjoyed and said, "Mr. Foster, Anthony has come out, and we have already drawn a clear line with the Turner family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You promised me before that as long as we draw a clear line with the Turner family, you will spare our lives. Can we go now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Alvin was speaking, the crowd not far away gathered around him with eager eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They did not want to stay in the Turner Manor for even a second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as Mason nodded, they would rush out of the Turner Manor as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The key point was that seeing Alvin's confident words, everyone believed him, and many people couldn't wait to get past Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, Mason's face darkened, and he said indifferently, "Who said you can leave?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Alvin was dumbfounded and said in a trembling voice, "Mr. Foster, didn't you promise me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Promise you what?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I only promised to spare your life, but when did I say I would let you go?" Mason sneered and questioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin was confused and asked blankly, "Mr. Foster, what do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason raised his head slightly, and with an extremely impassive gaze, he swept across the crowd and said in a deep voice, "Today is the Turner family's birthday party, and you are all invited to come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, you must be the Turner family's accomplices, so you all deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alvin!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard, you fooled us..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When these words were spoken, the crowd was shocked and immediately made loud noises. Many people directly cursed at Alvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seeing everyone like this, Mason nodded with satisfaction and said, ""Since you have chosen to take the initiative to sever your ties with the Turner family</span><span>, I can give you a chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you agree to one of my requests, I will let you go and spare your lives!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Foster, what is your request?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you are willing to forgive me, not just one request, ten will do..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Foster, if you have any request, just tell me, and I will do my best to help you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the crowd cried out in surprise and rushed over one by one, surrounding Mason to show their loyalty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that kind of anxious look, they probably wouldn't hesitate even if they were asked to kneel down and call him daddy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason laughed and sneered, "The requirements are simple. You should kneel down, swear allegiance to me, and join the Evil Spirit Legion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dedicate all your property and life to the Evil Spirit Legion unconditionally..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Join the Evil Spirit Legion?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as these words were spoken, the anxious crowd felt as if a bucket of cold water was poured over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The anxious expression froze on their faces, and the footsteps approaching Mason all retreated several steps away at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They really did not want to die and could do anything to stay alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the conditions for joining the Evil Spirit Legion were too unexpected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had to hand over all their property.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you want to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they were hesitating, Mason's tone changed, and he said in an impassive voice, "Or do you all want to die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family's birthday party gathered half of Yoland's people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If these people could be recruited at once, it would be a considerable force for Mason and the Evil Spirit Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The key point was that each of them had considerable wealth, and if they all got it together, it would be a very considerable amount.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Mason finished speaking, the werewolves in the distance suddenly howled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp howl was so loud and piercing that it made people feel scared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a demonstration and an undisguised threat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I do!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Foster, I do!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne was so frightened that her whole body trembled. She knelt on the ground neatly and swore, "Mr. Foster, I, Anne, swear that from now on, I will be loyal to you until death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am willing to give up my life and all my property, and obey all your orders unconditionally!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason nodded with satisfaction and said proudly, "You will know how correct today's decision is in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he turned his gaze to the others and asked in a deep voice, "What about you? Do you choose life or death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alvin still standing there in bewilderment, Anne said, "Alvin? What are you still standing there for? Why don't you kneel down? Submit to the Evil Spirit Legion and pledge allegiance to Mr. Foster. From now on, we will surely rise to prominence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And all of you, think carefully. It is wise to join the Mr. Foster!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you are stubborn and refuse to change, don't blame Mr. Foster for being rude!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After we destroy the Turner family, we will slaughter your entire clan!"</span></p></div>
