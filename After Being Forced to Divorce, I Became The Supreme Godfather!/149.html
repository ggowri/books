        <h1>Chapter 148 Fun</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the guards of the Smith family were ordinary people who came from major security companies or were trained by the Smith family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they could not be considered warriors, but they were a little stronger than ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not about strength but numbers!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's kill Anthony and split the money..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One hundred million dollars was a huge sum of money for many ordinary guards. How could they not be tempted?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the crowd rushed towards Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Anthony was chasing the Black Cloak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a Level B Warrior, the Black Cloak's strength and defense were impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he was seriously injured, it was still not easy to kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd rushed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Long swords flashing with cold lights stretched out from the crowd and slashed at Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their power was not strong, but Anthony did not want to be hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, he gave up the Black Cloak and turned to face the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel, who was not far away, looked gloomy and strode over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before he could make a move, Anthony shook his head at him, signaling him not to take action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel retreated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attack of so many people might have a little effect on people of average strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, for a strong man like Anthony, it was of no use at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel knew very well that Anthony's fighting ability was extraordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the very least, this group of people was far from enough to hurt Anthony!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd rushed forward, but Anthony handled it well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Muffled sounds followed one another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of ordinary security guards were vulnerable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's one move was enough to knock down several people. Soon, there were no less than ten people lying under Anthony's feet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The violent scene was jaw-dropping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being besieged by hundreds of people, Anthony was able to handle the situation with ease. Instead of being at a disadvantage, he became more courageous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd fell to the ground and wailed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could this happen? I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far away, Alvin was completely dumbfounded. His face changed again and again, and he took a few steps back in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but be afraid!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hundreds of people didn't even have the chance to get close to Anthony. In just a few moments, more than half of them fell down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way they could have cornered Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We are doomed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony is too strong. Who can stop him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at his expression. He will not stop until the Smith family is destroyed today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course. Anne slandered and insulted him before. Now that he has the chance, he must take revenge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can guarantee that if the Smith family can't stop him, Anthony will destroy them..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why hasn't the Evil Spirit Legion come yet? If they don't come, something terrible will happen..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was killing people in all directions with unstoppable force. Everyone was panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a lot of discussion. For a moment, many people didn't know what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is not appropriate to stay here for long..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Evil Spirit Legion has not arrived yet. There must be a problem. Let's leave..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. Innocent people might get hurt. Let's go..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people did not dare to stay and slipped away in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the first one, there would be the second and the third one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, most of the crowd had left, and the few people left were all hesitating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne was shocked!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The purpose of this family dinner was to enhance the cohesion of the Smith family and to unify Yoland with the help of the power of the Evil Spirit Legion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If all these people left, everything would be in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hastings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll give you what you want. Immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while of consideration, Anne didn't dare to delay. As she spoke, she started transferring money to Arthur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this case, even if she could save the Smith family, their prestige would plummet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur accepted the money very quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He inadvertently raised his head and looked at Anthony in the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony also glanced at Arthur. His hand movements quickened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just now, the reason why Anthony showed mercy was to wait for Arthur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The payment had been received. And the fun began!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lunatic!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be so presumptuous. Prepare your death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur suddenly rushed out. And with a loud shout, he landed on the ground with a bang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dust and smoke rose up and rushed in all directions with tremendous force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the crowd gathered around Anthony was shocked and took several steps back. Even Anthony couldn't help but take a step back.</span></p></div>
