        <h1>Chapter 24 The Best of Both</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Anthony realize that Anne was essentially begging him to speak on her behalf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was exactly in line with Anne's usual self-serving personality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her looking so pitiful, Anthony couldn't help but feel a twinge of smug satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He deliberately put on a stern expression, sneering. "I had a pleasant chat with Rose. It would be easy for me to say a few good things about you to her and help you get some projects, but the real question is, why should I help you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because you used me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because you publicly humiliated me and treated me like I was nothing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's face flushed as though she felt a pang of guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her lip and whispered, "I won't ask you to help for nothing. You'll benefit too. I know Ms. Turner is here to bid for valuable medicinal at the auction. You should also know that the Smith family has a thousand-year-old Eldergleam Fungus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony raised an eyebrow. "You want me to help you give the Eldergleam Fungus to Rose?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne shook her head. "The Turner family is prestigious, and Ms. Turner is a noble lady. If I were to send her a gift directly, she wouldn't accept it. But I've already arranged for the Eldergleam Fungus to be delivered here, along with a replica, to prevent theft. Tomorrow, two-thousand-year-old Eldergleam Fungus will be up for auction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can tell you which one is real, and then you can help Ms. Turner buy it at a lower price during the auction. That way, she'll be grateful to both of us, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll get the project I want, and you'll gain more favor from Ms. Turner. It's a win-win situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And once you have her favor, I'll also have enough leverage to persuade Alvin to call off the bounty on you. It will only benefit you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Anthony despised Anne, he couldn't help but admit that her plan was quite clever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been trying to find a way to secure valuable medicine for Rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had heard about the Smith family's thousand-year-old Eldergleam Fungus long ago. If he could get it at a low price, it would be a huge deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But agreeing to help Anne like this would feel like giving her too much of an advantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something about this whole situation still felt off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could this woman be scheming something?" he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It sounds good, but I still don't want to help you. If you just put the Eldergleam Fungus up for auction, I'm sure Ms. Turner won't mind paying a little more. You don't think Ms. Turner could tell the difference between the real one and the fake one, do you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why go through all this trouble, just to have Rose owe you a favor?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if she can't?" Anne said softly. "The two Eldergleam Fungus look identical. Only the Elder Council and I know which one is real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm confident that even Ms. Turner, with her abilities, can't tell them apart with 100% certainty. At that point, you'll tell her which one is real, and she'll be even more fond of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That reasoning was hard to refute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony looked at Anne, sneering. "I still don't want to help you. Unless you beg me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne felt a little embarrassed, but she forced a smile and said, "Alright, consider this me begging you! Please help me! For the sake of the three years we spent as husband and wife..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grabbed Anthony's hand, acting like a coquettish girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony shook his head. "I don't see any sincerity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a rare opportunity, and he didn't want to let this woman off easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he was going to make her pay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne looked a little uneasy. "What would make you think I'm sincere?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony sneered. "You always act so pure and aloof, right? Now, I want you to strip naked and beg me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's eyes flashed with a glint of anger. "Anthony, don't push me too far."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony chuckled coldly. "Not willing, huh? Then goodbye."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait!" Anne, realizing the true purpose of her visit, gritted her teeth and decided to throw caution to the wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She reached behind her and slowly pulled down the zipper of her dress, then began to </span><span>take it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this good enough?" she said, her face flushed as she looked at Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the moonlight, her body looked beautiful, glowing with an alluring sheen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony couldn't deny it; though her body no longer had the power to drive him wild as it once had, it was still undeniably tempting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said, completely naked."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spoke as if he were a hunter watching his prey, his smile chilling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne felt a rush of resistance in her heart, but under Anthony's gaze, she also felt an inexplicable thrill. She felt like Anthony had already been entranced by her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She believed that once she removed her last piece of clothing, completely exposed, Anthony would be unable to resist, would apologize, and beg her to take him as her slave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt a woman's most powerful weapon was her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, slowly, she unclipped her bra and removed her lace underwear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood tall, proudly, her chest out, facing Anthony, waiting for him to apologize and beg for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's gaze grew clearer as he smiled, "What I meant was, apologize and beg me."</span></p></div>
