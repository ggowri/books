        <h1>Chapter 45 The Birthday Party</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rose's birthday party?" Anthony exclaimed, his eyes widening in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder he sensed something odd about Rose's demeanor when she handed him the invitation. Helen had started to say something then but was quickly silenced by Rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that Rose was simply shy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't just a birthday celebration; it was also a coming-of-age ceremony where she would be officially recognized as the family heir, gaining the right to participate in family affairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the leaders of Yoland, this was a pivotal moment for the new leader to assume power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its significance was clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a bold thought struck Anthony: Rose was such a kind and innocent girl that few outsiders would wish her harm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what if the real threat lurked within the Turner family itself?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, while the struggle for inheritance in a large family might appear calm on the surface, it could easily be a hotbed of internal conflict.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose might not be adept at struggle, but her position forced her to endure battles she shouldn't have to fight. Beneath her composed exterior, she likely felt isolated and vulnerable, a situation that could explain a lot about her behavior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this bold hypothesis in mind, Anthony was resolute about attending the party.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he and Jane settled on a plan, he packed up, quietly slipped out of the Dragon Guild, and drove to the Turner Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way, he noticed that nearly all the vehicles were heading in the same direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, he spotted a familiar license plate&mdash;a Rolls-Royce that belonged to the Smith family, reserved for Anne, their heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the window, Anthony glimpsed Anne and Alvin sitting in the backseat, both </span><span>impeccably dressed and glowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was surprised that they had received invitations too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a small world!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Anthony was driving a car with a Dragon Guild license plate, which kept a low profile, so no one could easily identify him from the outside. Otherwise, if Anne, Alvin, or anyone else recognized him, it would undoubtedly cause a stir, considering he was now the most wanted man in the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about this made Anthony frown in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt incredibly unlucky; ever since his divorce from Anne, encountering the Godfather, and being selected for the Chosen Path, he had been pursued relentlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, he was hunted by both Anne and Alvin, with many eager to claim the bounty on his head. But this was nothing compared to the warrant issued by the Turner family, the oldest and most powerful clan in Yoland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Capturing him was no longer just about the bounty; it was also about earning the Turner family's favor and achieving rapid success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he pondered the implications of the Turner family's wanted poster while driving toward the manor, he could hardly believe his situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The path to becoming the Godfather was proving to be incredibly rocky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he found himself in a massive parking lot filled with luxury cars outside the Turner Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By chance, the staff directed him to park right next to Anne's Rolls-Royce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony sat in his car, planning to wait until Anne and Alvin left before making his exit, hoping to avoid any unnecessary confrontations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Anne and Alvin recognized the Dragon Guild car and assumed Jane was inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Yoland, Jane held a unique status. Alone, Jane and the Dragon Guild couldn't compete with the Turner family, but they were backed by the Dragon Group, widely known to be the Godfather's domain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Jane's identity incredibly prestigious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only Anne and Alvin but several other family heads gathered around, eager to take the opportunity to greet Jane and get closer to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even Ms. Ronald is here in person for Ms. Turner's birthday party! That shows just how influential Ms. Turner is. In Yoland, both Ms. Ronald and Ms. Turner are truly impressive role models for women," Anne remarked with envy, her eyes shining with jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but imagine how grand it would be if today's event were for her and she were one of the influential women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin chimed in enthusiastically, "Yes! Ms. Ronald is of noble status, and we must show respect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"ELet's line up to welcome Ms. Ronald, everyone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The business leaders responded affirmatively, forming two lines in respect, eagerly waiting for a glimpse of Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll open the door for Ms. Ronald!" Anne declared, excitement bubbling as she approached the car. Taking a deep breath, she respectfully pulled the door open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression shifted from anticipation to shock as she exclaimed, "Anthony? What are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief moment of confusion, she jumped back and shouted, "Everyone, Anthony's here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quick! Don't let him escape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd surged forward, surrounding Anthony and his car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family bodyguards stationed nearby immediately changed their expressions upon hearing Anthony's name, shouting and rushing toward him with submachine guns drawn.</span></p></div>
