        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to fight alongside you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was hesitant, and Rose said firmly, "If you can repel the werewolves and save the Turner family from the dire situation, from now on, everyone in the Turner family will follow your lead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we cannot defeat the werewolves, I'm willing to live and die with you, Anthony."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Rose took a step forward and stared at him with affection and love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In public, her affectionate expression was truly moving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was moved and said with emotion, "Okay, let's fight together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fighting together?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne looked at him with disdain and sneered, "You pretend to be calm because you know you're going to die, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are a bastard, a test subject, and you are so shameless as to accept the challenge. This is really ridiculous..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin raised his head, laughed, and said proudly, "Since you are going to die anyway, you might as well want to pretend and die with dignity, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This little trick of yours can only fool a naive person like Rose, and how could you have the strength to fight?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you don't piss your pants when you walk out of this door, I'll consider you a man..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the door, Mason became impatient and roared, "Get out and accept death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony took Rose's hand, ignored Anne and the others, and strode out the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are truly brave to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go! Let's go together and see how long this bastard can keep pretending..." Alvin stared at him indifferently and waved his hand, saying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go together..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Smith, you just said that you can protect us. Is that true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have drawn a clear line with the Turner family, so can we leave early?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Blake, we are not in the mood to join in the fun. Can you ask the werewolves to let us go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin waved his hand, and the crowd followed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, many people were already frightened and had no mood to watch the fun. They only wanted to leave the Turner Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin looked proud and said, "Don't worry. Who am I? My word is my bond! Do you think I am a shameless person like Anthony?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since I said I would keep you safe, I can definitely keep you safe!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I meet Mr. Foster later, I will say a few words for you, and you can leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's great."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Blake..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Blake, you are indeed a rare talent. From now on, I promise to follow your lead..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, as long as you can guarantee our safety, I promise to obey your orders, Mr. Blake..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was flattering him, and Alvin became confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked so domineering that people who did not know him might think he was Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regarding this, Anthony and others who were anxious in the front completely ignored it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Helen turned around inadvertently and sneered at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner is here..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner is personally supervising the battle. Let's cheer up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I swear to protect Ms. Turner, kill these damned beasts, and protect the peace of the Turner family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The east gate was not far away, and a group of people hurried over. As the terrified guards saw Rose coming, all raised their arms and shouted, and their morale was greatly boosted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Rose said, as the heir of the Turner family, she was almost equivalent to Carolyn and was the spiritual pillar of the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she hid, the morale of the Turner family's guards would definitely plummet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, she chose to stand up, which was also an encouragement to the morale of the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Anthony appearing, Mason sneered, "Anthony? You coward, you finally come </span><span>out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought you would wait until all the women in the Turner family were dead before you dared to stand up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason's voice was a little hoarse and contained a murderous aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A loose dark robe covered his entire body, revealing only a pair of eyes emitting green light, impassive and fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony stepped forward and asked in confusion, "I really don't understand that Vincent has been exiled to the mines, and why is the Evil Spirit Legion still pestering us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, as early as the first time he met the werewolves, he guessed that they were coming for Vincent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was indeed the case.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person who hired the werewolves was Vincent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, his conspiracy had been discovered by Anthony, and Vincent had pleaded guilty and voluntarily exiled to the mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logically speaking, the werewolves should stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they became more ferocious and were determined to break into the Turner family at all costs. This was obviously abnormal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for Mason to reply, Alvin sneered, "Coward! Aren't you afraid of death? What do you mean the time has come? Why do you come out and talk nonsense?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you still asking why? Isn't this simple? You killed Mr. Foster's men, so you should pay with your life. Is there anything wrong with that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are not only a waste, but also a fool!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After angrily cursing at Anthony, Alvin turned around and flattered Mason. "Mr. Foster, Anthony is just a test subject.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The reason why he was able to kill you men before was because he used the special medicine from the Godfather Research Institute."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The test subject?" Mason smiled and looked at Anthony meaningfully.</span></p></div>
