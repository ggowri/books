        <h1>Chapter 123 Changing One's Appearance</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph, personally dispatched by the Godfather and tasked with closely assisting Anthony, was far more than just a pretty face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, she knew that since Anthony had recruited such a large group of people like Arthur, he must have some plan in mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony merely smiled and said, "For now, you don't need to get involved with establishing Draconic Shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just a security company. If he can't handle this small task, how could he be trusted with more important responsibilities in the future?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned his gaze to Arthur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur was shocked, and he immediately replied with a serious tone, "Mr. Johnson, please be assured. I have a plan. Within three days, Draconic Shield will definitely be officially established."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps due to the soul contract, Arthur didn't dare to defy Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he was afraid of doing anything that might displease him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony wasn't particularly concerned about these matters and instead said, "Establishing Draconic Shield is just the first step and the easiest one at that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The next phase is to control Yoland's prominent families secretly. That's the real key.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are your thoughts on this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well..." Arthur hesitated for a moment, then said, "I believe the most critical issue right now is manpower."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not interested in ordinary people, so my plan is to find an opportunity to recruit from the Evil Spirit Legion..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Arthur hesitated again, nervously glancing at Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh?" Anthony raised an eyebrow, intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You mean continue undermining the Evil Spirit Legion?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Anthony wasn't angry, Arthur let out a sigh of relief and explained, "Since Mr. Johnson wants to use Draconic Shield as a stepping stone, the strength of Draconic Shield is crucial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Evil Spirit Legion doesn't know about my situation yet, which is a golden opportunity we can't miss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I plan to contact as many of my old acquaintances as possible within three days and select suitable personnel from among them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good." Anthony nodded with satisfaction, then turned his attention to Arthur's facial scars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of consideration, he asked Seraph, "Can these scars be removed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur's scars crisscrossed, covering half his face, making him look particularly grotesque.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The critical issue was that this hideous appearance was highly distinctive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The establishment of Draconic Shield held immense significance for Anthony, so he had to be extremely cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Changing one's appearance was the most prudent solution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Arthur's plan was clearly to operate covertly, and his face would make stealth impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Child's play," Seraph said casually, glancing over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget a few scars, even if his entire face were destroyed, I could restore it to its original state."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather Group possessed the world's most cutting-edge technology and the most exceptional, comprehensive research team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scar removal was child's play for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You...you mean the scars on my face can be removed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news that his facial scar could be removed initially stunned Arthur, but then he was overcome with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a large scar was indeed hard to accept, and judging by his facial features, Arthur wasn't a bad-looking guy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His reaction suggested he'd long been self-conscious about the mark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would be best to remove it, especially since he would be in the public eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony smiled and said to Seraph, "Go ahead and make the arrangements. The sooner, the better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," Seraph replied with a nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood up, her curves swaying as she gracefully exited the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur couldn't help but stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony snapped his fingers, bringing Arthur back to attention. "Seven days," he declared. "You have only seven days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?" The sudden declaration took aback Arthur, then quickly bowed. "Yes, Mr. Johnson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Within seven days, I will ensure Draconic Shield makes a name for itself in Yoland."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony shook his head. "If you're just looking to make a name, you only have three days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Within seven days, I want Draconic Shield fully established, with a comprehensive security system and a team of top-tier security personnel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only then can Draconic Shield be ready to accept mission assignments and officially provide services to Yoland's families."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur scratched his head helplessly, nervously saying, "But, Mr. Johnson, Yoland's </span><span>families already have specific security companies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're a new company with no reputation and no connections. I'm afraid we might not..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, Anthony cut him off with a wave of his hand. "Seven days from now, the Smith family will host a gathering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They'll invite representatives from all of Yoland's major families. This is our opportunity. I'll personally work to dismantle the existing security teams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So in seven days, Draconic Shield must have enough strength to replace other security companies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for reputation, I'll negotiate with the Turner family. With the Turner family backing you, isn't that reputation enough?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wow!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After this speech, Arthur was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur was stunned by these words. If what Anthony said was true, he would barely have to do anything himself and focus on recruiting and building his strength!</span></p></div>
