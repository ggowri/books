        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Catch Rose and make amends!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, you useless guy, from now on, you can rise to prominence..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph! You bastard, you're not still dreaming of clinging to the Turner family, are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Turner family is about to be ruined, and this is your only chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't you catch Rose and make amends?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne denounced her angrily, and others followed suit, criticizing Anthony seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason why Anthony remained silent was not because he was afraid but because he was considering what the real purpose of the Evil Spirit Legion was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at present, he knew too little about the Evil Spirit Legion and not much about the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, Anthony was baffled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After gathering his thoughts helplessly, he said, "I don't think I'm a hero, but I will never sell out my dignity and soul."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Werewolves belonged to the Evil Spirit Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane had said before that the werewolves and the Evil Spirit Legion had signed a soul contract.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kind of soul contract could make the werewolves unconditionally loyal to the Evil Spirit Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was precisely because of this that Anthony had warned those people headed by Anne that once they chose to join the Evil Spirit Legion, there would be no turning back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he was deep in thought, he could hear them shouting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He ignored them, stared at Mason, and said, "First of all, I am not a hero, but I will not sell my soul and surrender to any evil organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Secondly, Ms. Turner is my friend. Anyone who wants to hurt her must kill me first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, did you say I was a test subject?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about you? Didn't you also use drugs to awaken your superpowers?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe the medicine from the Godfather Research Institute is stronger than yours, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying that, Anthony deliberately put on an overconfident attitude, staring at Mason with an arrogant look and disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Mason believed Alvin's lies, Anthony didn't mind taking advantage of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought he was a test subject, so he was. There seemed to be nothing wrong in showing weakness to the enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Mason flew into a rage, shouted, and rushed out in one step, "Um? "Asshole! You're looking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two were less than 109 feet apart, and Mason was furious, moving at an incredibly fast speed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black shadow was like a thundering whirlwind, and in an instant, it crossed a distance of 109 feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dark arm stretched out from under the dark robe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His five fingers were as hard as wolf claws!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason came with great force, and the wind was blowing loudly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he rushed straight toward Anthony's throat. This claw was enough to break the stone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was fine if he did not make a move, but once he made a move, it was a killing move, brutal and fierce!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This claw was enough to pierce Anthony's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come and attack me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's eyes flashed. In fact, the reason why he said that was to deliberately provoke Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level B metahuman was very powerful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Anthony's current strength, he may not be a match for Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not a wise move to confront him head-on. Provoking him was also a strategy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a fierce punch, delivered with swiftness and force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, such a direct and powerful punch also exposed many weaknesses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A swift and powerful punch was powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ordinary people could not capture and master this kind of weakness in such a short time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony could not do it either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he had the Devil Eye!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The punch was as fast as lightning, but in his eyes, its speed slowed down a lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the speed was slow, the weaknesses would be exposed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony flashed and easily avoided the fierce claws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he bent down, gathered power in his right fist, and flew past Mason's fist, hitting him hard in the heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was also a straight and extremely ferocious punch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the speed and angle of Anthony's punch were obviously stronger than that of Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of strength, Mason was far superior to Anthony, but he was careless and </span><span>underestimated Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, this seemingly fierce punch was not thrown with full strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other hand, Anthony's punch was well-prepared, and it was full of power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He attacked Mason at the best time and at the best angle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It happened in a flash, and the two fists landed almost at the same time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Mason's punch was missed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's punch, on the contrary, hit Mason's heart solidly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A punch landed, with a huge impact force, rushed toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason groaned, and his body under the wide dark robe trembled. He retreated a few hundred feet away along with the stirred dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How come?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell? Am I dazzled?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible? Anthony, a loser, actually forced Mr. Foster to retreat?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With one punch, Mason was thrown back a few hundred feet, and the crowd was in an uproar, shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected that Anthony, a jerk like him, could burst out with such powerful strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony threw a punch, and his eyes fixed on Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he took a few steps, without waiting for Mason to stand firm, he rushed over quickly, taking advantage of the situation and pursuing Mason with great momentum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Anthony crazy? He, he dares to take the initiative to attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Foster was just careless for a moment and didn't really think Anthony could defeat, did he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph! The development of things is not subject to human will but has its own objective laws. That bastard is going to die..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Foster, there is no need to show mercy, kill him..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! Kill him. Mr. Foster, kill him..."</span></p></div>
