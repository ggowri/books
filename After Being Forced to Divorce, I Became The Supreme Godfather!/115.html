        <h1>Chapter 114 Destiny</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sickly weakling?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That wasn't far from the truth. Rose was the eldest daughter of the Turner family, but everyone in Yoland knew that Rose was frail and prone to illness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she possessed a powerful healing power, she was unable to heal herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do you know it won't work if you don't try?" Rose wasn't bothered by the comment; in fact, she smiled, a smile that could topple empires, elegant and mesmerizing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet beneath her charm, there was an air of composure and mystery, as if she were beyond the reach of others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." Anne froze, momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Buzz!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Rose didn't give her the chance to speak. She slowly raised her arms, her fingers moving rapidly as she formed an intricate series of hand signs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As her fingers danced in the air, a white mist began to rise around her, its faint green hue glowing softly within the mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air itself seemed to shimmer with the ethereal energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn was completely taken aback, her eyes wide with shock as she stared at Rose in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Rose stood where Anthony had once stood, amidst the ruins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slowly, she raised her hands above her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she did, the mist began to spread, flowing outward in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is this...?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's happening? What's she doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? What is Ms. Turner doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene left not only Anne dumbfounded but many members of the Turner family also completely confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mist, like something out of a divine realm, floated up around Rose, enveloping her in a dreamy, almost celestial haze, as if she were stepping through clouds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My injuries..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is... Is that the healing power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Her healing power... It's so strong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the mist spread through the air, it seemed like something from a celestial prophecy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, the crowd was confused, unsure of what was happening. But then, a wave of astonished exclamations rose from the members of the Turner family as they realized what they were witnessing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within the thick mist, there was an almost tangible healing power radiating from Rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if they were being bathed in a mystical elixir, restoring strength and healing wounds at a miraculous rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sensation of rapid recovery was indescribably strange yet wondrous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rose&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a distance, Carolyn's voice broke through the air, her eyes filled with tears as she trembled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had done it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose had broken through!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was now a Level B Metahuman, specializing in healing powers!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Is she... healing them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is that possible? How could her powers be so strong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family members were in an uproar. Nearby, Anne was seething, her eyes wide with disbelief as she shouted. "Impossible! This can't be real! How could one person heal so many at once?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the mist, Rose slowly stepped forward, her gaze fixed on Anne. "For someone like you, how can you truly understand what is possible and what is not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne was livid, practically foaming at the mouth as she snapped. "Rose, don't get arrogant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what if you've broken through? So what if you can heal them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think one person can save the Turner family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dream on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After Mr. Foster kills Anthony, he'll come back, and the Turner family will not escape its doom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm telling you, the moment you foolishly chose to help that worthless Anthony, your family's fate was sealed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't save the Turner family. That useless Anthony can't save them either..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's voice was laced with venom, filled with rage and despair. The words spilled from her in a wild frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart was filled with hatred, fury, and a deep sense of injustice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why? Why should Rose, a sickly girl, be allowed to become so powerful?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family was on the verge of collapse&mdash;why should she be the one to save them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rose&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Carolyn stood up in shock, her voice trembling with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rushed to Rose's side, pulling her out of the mist as she asked breathlessly, "You... you and Anthony... you two...?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn stammered, almost unable to process what she was hearing. Rose, however, remained calm and confident. "I just... shared a special moment with Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony is my destined soulmate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I love him more than anything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words sent a jolt through everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel and Jane, nearby, were stunned into silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel was more surprised and in disbelief, while Jane's beautiful eyes widened in shock, quickly giving way to an unusual emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You wretched woman! Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose turned to face Anne, her voice sharp with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Anne continued to shout and hurl insults from afar, Rose's expression hardened. "Let me make something clear, Anthony is my husband, and from this moment on, he is a part of the Turner family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you dare insult my husband again, I promise, I will make your Smith family pay an unimaginable price!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was an orphan&mdash;at least, that was how Rose saw him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, now that they had shared a marital bond, it was only natural for her to consider him part of her family, the one closest to her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose's protective declaration stunned Anne, who had been shouting in rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony Johnson?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A worthless nobody, someone Anne had dismissed as beneath her, was now the Turner family's honored guest, and on top of that, Rose's husband?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could this be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was nothing but trash that should have rotted away in the streets!</span></p></div>
