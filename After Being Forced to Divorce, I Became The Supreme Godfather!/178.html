        <h1>Chapter 177 Ambush Him</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne never missed a chance to cozy up to powerful figures. With Vincent about to take control of the Turner family and already aligning himself with the Evil Spirit Legion, he was, in her eyes, the most influential person she could latch onto.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Vincent turned around and saw her, he didn't seem surprised. "Anne?" he said casually. After all, </span><span>h</span><span>e'd already told Lorcan how she'd been kissing up to the big shots and selling out to the Evil Spirit Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, Vincent had his own agenda. By doing this, he could completely bring Yoland under his control. From now on, Yoland would revere the Turner family, and the Turner family would answer to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After giving Anne a quick glance, Vincent asked, "You said we don't need our Lords to take action. What do you mean by that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne straightened up, not daring to waste a word. "I know someone who can completely defeat Anthony, maybe even kill him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? You? You know someone like that? If that's the case, then why isn't Anthony dead yet? Weren't you the one who hated him the most?" Vincent </span><span>chuckled,</span><span> his tone laced with skepticism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne froze for a moment before quickly explaining, "Well... that's because I didn't know this person before. Have you heard of Draconic Shield, Mr. Vincent Turner?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent raised an eyebrow. "Draconic Shield? I've heard a little about it. That's a rising security company and a rising star in Yoland, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's face lit up and nodded. "Exactly. The person I'm talking about is Aaron Hastings, the head of Draconic Shield. Not long ago, Anthony crashed the Smith family banquet, and Aaron beat him to a pulp. If it weren't for Dariel protecting Anthony, he would've been dead on the spot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent's expression brightened with interest. "Oh? Is that so? Where is </span><span>this</span><span> Aaron? Bring him to see me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne quickly replied, "Aaron is </span><span>already </span><span>here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alvin stepped through the door, pulling Arthur along with him. "Greetings, Mr. Vincent Turner," he said with a polite nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur, on the other hand, was cursing inwardly, "Why did you have to drag me into this? If you want to butter up Vincent, leave me out of it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had assumed this would just be a routine escort job, but now things had escalated&mdash;straight into the Turner family's Mines, no less. This was far beyond what he'd expected, and he knew it was equally unexpected for Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, Arthur had tried to discreetly contact Anthony while waiting outside, but his efforts had failed. The Turner family's Mines clearly had some kind of signal-jamming equipment in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Vincent wasn't entirely wrong&mdash;Anthony would definitely show up to rescue Rose. </span><span>So</span><span> Arthur figured he had to do something before that happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the binding of the soul contract, Arthur couldn't help but instinctively think about how to ease Anthony's burdens. Deep down, he didn't want to help Vincent, especially if it meant going against Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Arthur was silently cursing his luck, Vincent sized him up, seeming quite pleased. "Hah. Not bad... So, you're the one who defeated Anthony?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur didn't hesitate and nodded. "Yes, Mr. Vincent Turner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you confident you can kill him?" Vincent asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ninety percent sure," Arthur replied, standing tall and proud. Though he claimed ninety percent confidence, his demeanor made it seem like he had the situation completely under control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent burst into laughter and nodded. "Good. If you manage to kill Anthony, I'll reward you with 100 million dollars. No, let's make it 300 million dollars. On top of that, you'll be my right-hand man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, what Vincent's crew lacked most were </span><span>E</span><span>xperts. The Four Demon Lords were powerful </span><span>E</span><span>xperts, sure, but they were Lorcan's men, not his. Vincent was eager to cultivate his own </span><span>team</span><span>, and Arthur seemed to fit the bill perfectly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur responded humbly, "Thank you for your trust, Mr. Vincent Turner. I'll do everything in my power to solve your problems." Though bound by a soul contract, he played the part well, exuding respect and sincerity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne was dumbfounded when she saw Arthur act this way&mdash;he was hers! Or at least, that was what she'd thought. But now, with just one offhand comment from Vincent, one of her </span><span>men</span><span> had turned his back on her and joined Vincent instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustrated, she cursed inwardly, "If I'd known it'd turn out like this, I wouldn't have </span><span>said a damn thing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unaware of Anne's inner turmoil, Vincent was overjoyed. He clapped his hands and said, "Alright. I have a mission for you, which will also serve as a test. In 9.32 miles south of the Mines lies Crimson Canyon. That is the only route through here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take a team, ambush Anthony there, kill him, and bring me his head. Do that, and I'll make sure you're second only to me. But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice suddenly hardened as he continued, "If you think about lying to me or can't finish the job, then bring your own head to me. Got it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur nodded firmly and replied, "Got it. You have my word, Mr. Vincent Turner. Anthony's head will be yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent's grin widened with excitement as he waved Arthur off. "Good, go on now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Arthur left, Vincent leaned back and pondered, "If I don't use the Four Demon Lords to kill Anthony, I could prove my capabilities to Lord </span><span>Iscairn</span><span> myself. This is a two-birds-one-stone plan&mdash;it'll also be a chance to test Aaron's strength."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Aaron proves himself, then I'll gain a powerful new ally. If he dies, so be it&mdash;the Four Demon Lords can handle it later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The reason Vincent had chosen Crimson Canyon wasn't just its strategic location as the only route to the Mines. The area was also covered </span><span>by</span><span> surveillance systems connected to the Mines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From the safety of his headquarters, Vincent could monitor the entire battle. Plus, the fight wouldn't damage any part of the Mines itself. As these thoughts swirled, Vincent couldn't help but smirk, pondering, "I really am a genius."</span></p></div>
