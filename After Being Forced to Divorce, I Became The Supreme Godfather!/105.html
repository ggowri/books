        <h1>Chapter 104 Wreaking Havoc</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bullets rained down relentlessly, sending the werewolf army scattering in panic and howls of pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when they took cover behind walls, those walls would explode in an instant, obliterating the werewolves along with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they hid behind trees, those trees would be shattered at the trunk. And if they sought refuge beneath boulders, those rocks could hardly withstand the immense power of the bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the werewolf army had nowhere to hide, suffering heavy losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Anthony, you coward!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason roared in a mix of rage and desperation, "If you're still a man, drop your weapons and fight me one-on-one. Do you dare?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony laughed scornfully, his voice echoing. "One-on-one? Are you out of your mind?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why would I fight you one-on-one? I'm going to blast you to oblivion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a barrage of bullets shot towards Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, a large ornamental rock exploded into smithereens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason was taken aback. He rolled on the ground in a disheveled scramble, barely dodging the bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Anthony, you piece of trash! Coward!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another round of bullets came his way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bastard! You're not a man! Coward!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bullets kept coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony paid no heed to Mason's howling. He continued to wreak havoc without restraint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason was furious yet helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing the relentless onslaught, Mason could only leap and dodge, looking utterly disheveled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, all possible cover was pulverized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason was left with nowhere to hide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this continued, despite his speed and strength, he was bound to be blasted into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason thought to himself, "Should I retreat? Never! We're just one step away from annihilating the Turner family. If I retreat now, all my efforts will be in vain. We've withstood a hail of bullets, Carolyn, and even level-C metahumans. Are we to be defeated by Anthony, this good-for-nothing? But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony stood atop the ruins, holding the Inferno Gatling, commanding the high ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter which direction the werewolf army attacked from, they would be met with fierce and powerful bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Foster, look!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Mason hesitated, several werewolves dragged what looked like "corpses" from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason turned to look closely, and his eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were not corpses but rather several members of the Turner Guards, severely wounded and barely clinging to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, stop it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason grabbed one of the guards, placed a blade against his neck, and stepped out from the cover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From his vantage point in the ruins, Anthony aimed his gun, only to find that they were his men. He was taken aback and released his grip on the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Anthony dared not fire, Mason laughed maniacally, taunting, "Coward, shoot! Have the guts to shoot again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's face darkened, but he dared not act rashly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Inferno Gatling's power was immense. The slightest mistake and the guards held captive by Mason would be blown to bits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, if he dared to act recklessly, the werewolves would show no mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man looked severely injured, on the brink of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, Anthony hesitated to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason laughed wildly and said triumphantly, "Drop your gun! Or they all die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, several werewolves emerged from cover, each holding a Turner family guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle had been too chaotic, and many had been injured. The Turner family had not had time to conduct a rescue operation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The injured had to hide on their own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they were discovered by the werewolves and dragged out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Johnson, don't! We're not afraid to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right! Mr. Johnson, don't lower your gun..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Johnson, we're not afraid to die. Kill them! Kill these beasts..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Anthony could respond, the guards, under duress, shouted at him with bloodshot eyes, all ready to face death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up! Do you want to die?" Mason bellowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pressed the blade down harder and shouted at Anthony, "Anthony, I'm giving you ten seconds. If you don't drop your gun, I'll kill one person every ten seconds. Ten, nine... six, five..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Johnson, don't!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're all dying. We're not worth the risk..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guys, let's fight these beasts to the death! Kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Anthony could make a choice, the Turner family's guards, their eyes filled with desperation, shouted out. They struggled fiercely, ignoring the blades against their throats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some even threw their necks back, ready to embrace death, as they lunged towards the sharp edges.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was taken aback by their actions. Mason and the other werewolves were also startled, moving their blades away on their own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These men couldn't die easily. Otherwise, how could they threaten Anthony?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn you all! Get down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolves reacted just in time. The guards didn't die but were forced to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, you have three seconds left."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason raised his blade and slashed a guard's neck, blood gushing out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason pressed the blade further down, cutting into the neck of one of the guards, blood flowing freely.</span></p></div>
