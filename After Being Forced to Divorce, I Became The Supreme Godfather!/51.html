        <h1>Chapter 50 Transformation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Anne and those around her were captivated by the intense battle, holding their breaths in anticipation, a sudden loud bang echoed across the field.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was jolted, as if roused from a dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that Anthony and Dariel had collided directly. The tremendous shockwave created a sonic boom, and the air within inches of the two was instantly compressed into a vacuum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sand and debris were sent flying, and the wind howled ferociously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone screamed and instinctively recoiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, both Anthony and Dariel staggered backward simultaneously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony retreated seven steps, while Dariel took eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How was this possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it seemed like a stalemate, Dariel had ultimately lost ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony is the best! Go, Anthony!" Anne couldn't contain her excitement and cheered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people around her turned to look at her in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was supposed to be Anthony's sworn enemy. To eliminate him, she had allied with Alvin and even placed a bounty of 100 million dollars on his head. So why was she cheering for him now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin, noticing her jubilant expression, quickly deduced her thoughts. His face paled, and he gritted his teeth. "Bitch, are you planning to betray me and go back to Anthony?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm warning you. Anthony is nothing but a powerless loser. He stands no chance against my family. If you dare to betray me, you'll regret it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, I'll leak all those sex tapes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words struck a nerve with Anne, and terror flickered in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly clung to Alvin's arm, forcing a smile. "I was just cheering for Captain Stein. I hate Anthony! I must've shouted the wrong name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Betray you? How could I do that? We're engaged!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shouted again toward the battlefield, "Come on, Captain Stein! Anthony is just a loser! He won't last much longer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin smirked, satisfied. He had to keep Anne firmly by his side. If she turned against him and went back to Anthony, he would lose all his dignity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wrapped his arm around her waist, and they appeared to be a loving couple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But inside, Anne was growing to hate Alvin. Yet, this wasn't the right moment to act on her feelings. She still needed to leverage Alvin and the Blake family's power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, she knew Alvin was right. No matter how formidable Anthony might be, he was alone. If he angered the Turner family, it would be his end. She couldn't risk offending Alvin, her support, for Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, to please Alvin, she had done things she regretted, and he had recorded their intimate moments&mdash;some of which were downright scandalous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had to protect her reputation. If those videos got out, she'd never be able to show her face again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin began shouting too. "Go, Captain Stein!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill that bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd joined in, their voices rising in support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst the uproar, Dariel felt his fighting spirit surge. It had been ages since he faced such a strong adversary or experienced a fight this exhilarating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gradually lowered his stance, placing his hands on the ground, and began to transform into a four-legged beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes turned a fiery red as cracks appeared along his back, and green fur sprouted forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the audience fell deathly silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew Dariel was about to undergo a transformation, summoning his awakened wolf form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stared in awe, riveted by this extraordinary spectacle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, his clothes ripped apart as his muscular frame expanded, morphing him into a </span><span>massive half-human, half-wolf creature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bared his fangs at Anthony, letting out a low, menacing howl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, Anthony sensed a grave threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never felt so on edge, even when facing three mutated werewolves before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the stark contrast between a drug-stimulated werewolf and one who had truly awakened their primal nature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel was a genuine beast Metahuman, with pure blood and immense power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing he couldn't rely solely on his own strength, Anthony also crouched down, mimicking a beast's stance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he didn't transform, he unleashed a roar that echoed like a leopard's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden sound of the cheetah's roar drowned out Dariel's howl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force of the sound struck everyone like a death knell, knocking some weaker people to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How was that possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stared at Anthony in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could he also be a beast Metahuman and a leopard, which was even more fearsome than a wolf?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel's expression shifted dramatically. Fear filled him as the momentum he had built up instantly deflated, and his confidence began to crumble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never imagined that Anthony was also a beast Metahuman&mdash;and a leopard at that, more powerful than himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel panicked, like a lone wolf confronted by a leopard king in the wild. He wanted to flee, but there was nowhere to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that he had unexpectedly crushed Dariel's fighting spirit, Anthony felt a surge of exhilaration. He took a step forward, using his hands like forepaws, and released an even more thunderous tiger roar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground trembled beneath the power of his roar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The innate dominance from his bloodline caused Dariel to collapse to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The audience erupted in screams, many of them staggering and falling down.</span></p></div>
