        <h1>Chapter 74 Unstoppable</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the banquet hall, Alvin showed no remorse and sneered, "Anthony, you will definitely die this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner is so beautiful. If such a good woman dies because of you, wouldn't it be a pity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apologize to me and call me grandpa. If I am satisfied, I can ask the Evil Spirit Legion to spare your life. How about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's intention of personally participating in the battle was to boost the morale of the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in Alvin's view, it was the Turner family's last gasp. Otherwise, why would the leader of the Turner family take action personally?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Carolyn had taken away all the personal guards, so Alvin was arrogant once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing his words, everyone looked at Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you tired? Sit down and rest for a while," said Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He ignored Alvin and pulled Rose to sit down, comforting her. "Don't worry. The power of the Turner family is enough to resist the Evil Spirit Legion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose nodded. "Anthony, don't worry. As long as you are in the Turner Manor, no one can hurt you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony also nodded, and Rose once again took the initiative to hold his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enemy was at the gates, but the two were still not in a hurry but comforting each other in public, which made Alvin furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony. You bastard, you are about to die, and you still dare to bluff," said Alvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He jumped up and continued angrily, "Everyone, the Evil Spirit Legion outside has gathered because of this bastard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Carolyn... Ms. Carolyn Turner was worried about the Turner family's reputation and couldn't say it out loud directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you going to watch as such a bastard destroys the Turner family? Besides, look. How long Dariel can hold out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing his words, many people looked at the big screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, Dariel and others outside the gate were utterly unable to withstand the werewolves' attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation was critical, and it wouldn't be long before the werewolves broke through the gate if it continued like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing how ferocious the werewolves were, many members of the Turner family became a little restless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing everyone's expressions, Alvin continued, "Everyone, once the Evil Spirit Legion breaks through the gate, we will all be in trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony is a bastard. His death is not a pity. But what about us? Why should we die because of him? Why should we be buried with him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In my opinion, we should capture him and hand him over to the Evil Spirit Legion for disposal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can guarantee that the Evil Spirit Legion will not hurt the Turner family as long as you hand over Anthony."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone present thought his words were correct.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was a bastard, and his death was not a pity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Anthony had just met the Turner family by chance. Why should the Turner family die with him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner..." Finally, a middle-aged man stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you!" Rose's eyes became angry, and she scolded, "Are you still a member of the Turner family? Wasn't what my aunt said just now clear enough?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As the heir of the Turner family, I declare once again that the Turner family swears to stand together with Anthony and live and die with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If anyone dares to shake the morale again, don't blame me for being rude."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose, who had been soft, was furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the Turner family was frightened by her words and dared not say another word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin was still unwilling and wanted to say something else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Rose turned around and said, "If this pair of bastards dare to spread rumors and confuse the public again, beat them to death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it." A dozen of Rose's guards stepped forward, staring at Alvin and Anne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing such a scene, Alvin finally stopped and dared not speak anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that as Rose's guards, these people had probably been dissatisfied with him for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking Alvin was just a clown, Rose ignored him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she turned around, she found that Anthony was staring at the big screen with a frown. So she asked, "What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing." Anthony retracted his gaze and smiled at her, signaling her to be at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Mason, outside the gate, had disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose was about to say something when the Turner Manor suddenly trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The considerable movement was like a mountain collapsing and the earth splitting apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the big screen, they could see thick smoke and blood mist outside the gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking closely, the guards had used a powerful weapon, and a shell hit the werewolves hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amid the smoke, blood and flesh were scattered, and wailing was heard everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the smoke cleared, only three of the dozen werewolves were left, and they were missing limbs and suffered heavy losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them!" Seeing the werewolves were frustrated, Dariel rushed forward first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a fierce battle, only a dozen of the thirty or so people brought by Dariel were left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they hadn't used their most powerful weapon, they wouldn't have been able to stop those werewolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, using the most powerful weapon was, to a certain extent, a humiliation to them and a denial of their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel thought, "Damn it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them!" It was not just Dariel who had red eyes. The few remaining guards also had red eyes and rushed toward the remaining werewolves with roars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as they were about to kill, another wolf howl was heard from the corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately afterward, more than a dozen ferocious-looking werewolves rushed up with bared fangs and claws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel was horrified and shouted, "Retreat! Retreat now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolves had planned it long ago. More than a dozen of them were like tigers descending from the mountains, unstoppable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cloud of blood mist flew up, and more than half of the dozen or so guards left were </span><span>killed tragically in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it. You bastards. I'll fight you to death," roared Dariel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were red, just like a wild beast. He tore the werewolf apart with his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, there were too many werewolves.</span></p></div>
