        <h1>Chapter 153 Virstino Mountains</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just three days, Anne, using the guise of the Evil Spirit Legion, went all out to recruit the families of Yoland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within such a short time, she managed to bring almost ninety percent of the families in Yoland under her control, making a huge splash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, the Smith family's status skyrocketed, and now, they were the most respected family in the entire city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other hand, the Turner family, once an old powerhouse, had completely fallen off the radar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Turner family didn't seem to care. For the past few days, there had been no word from the Mines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Vincent went there, it was like he disappeared into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn sent someone to check, but there was still no update.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more she thought about it, the more uneasy she felt, like something just didn't sit right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had originally planned to go herself, but with the Smith family stirring up trouble, she had her hands full with family matters and couldn't make the trip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That afternoon, Anthony wrapped up his cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, no news at all?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The people we sent, they just... vanished?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony frowned when Rose filled him in. Something definitely felt off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it's just Vincent. Does he have the guts to pull this off?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trying to take control of the Turner family's Mines all by himself? With just a handful of guards?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on a sec..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wasn't it Vincent who secretly brought in those werewolves to attack me and Rose?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And didn't Arthur confirm that Vincent has ties with the Evil Spirit Legion?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Turner family's mines are right in the </span><span>Virstino</span><span> Mountains... Could this be connected?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Anthony was piecing things together, his phone rang. It was Arthur, telling him that Anne and the heads of the other families had set off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rose, the situation with the Mines doesn't feel right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to step out for a bit. When Carolyn gets back, tell her not to do anything stupid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what happens, wait for me to come back. Don't make any moves without me, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony gave a few final instructions before hurrying out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Mines could wait for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Vincent was working with the Evil Spirit Legion, it wouldn't cause any big waves just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Arthur's informant was key.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Anthony could catch this informant, he'd finally understand what the Evil Spirit Legion was up to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to that, Vincent's little schemes didn't matter much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Anne, her group was a force to be reckoned with, at least three hundred people, made up of core family members and their security staff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of all the security personnel, nearly seventy percent were members of Draconic Shield, around a hundred people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the families in Yoland had signed long-term contracts with Draconic Shield, though the number of people varied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A convoy of over a hundred off-road vehicles sped through the winding mountain roads, their headlights bright and blinding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a distance, the convoy looked like a fiery dragon winding its way into the </span><span>Virstino</span><span> Mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the distant forests, Anthony moved like a sleek predator, keeping pace with the convoy as they traveled through the rugged terrain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the front of the convoy, a Draconic Shield's armored vehicle led the way, well-equipped and ready for anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mountain path was tough, so the convoy wasn't moving very fast. It seemed like they had started a bit later than planned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time they entered the </span><span>Virstino</span><span> Mountains, the sun had nearly set, and as they went further, the darkness took over, soon enveloping the entire landscape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they reached the mountain range, the convoy came to a halt. The path ahead was too treacherous to continue by vehicle, so everyone got out and started walking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the vehicles, there had been lighthearted chatter, full of excitement and anticipation for what was to come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as they stepped out into the pitch-black wilderness, the mood shifted. The surroundings were eerie and desolate, with sharp rocks scattered all around, and the cold wind cut through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were the pampered children of aristocratic families, used to leisurely strolls through parks and scenic spots, not trekking through an uncharted mountain range at night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Anne and Alvin were on edge, instinctively pulling closer together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the group grew increasingly uneasy, Arthur gave a commanding shout, and bright white lights suddenly illuminated the pitch-black sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Relax, everyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Draconic Shield's got everything covered. With these lights, it's practically daylight. You're safe with us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his voice again, encouraging them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the showdown with the Smith family, Arthur's reputation had soared, and his strength was now widely respected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words had a calming effect on everyone, and they visibly relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the path lit up, Arthur took the lead. "Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Arthur so confident gave Anne the boost she needed. She waved her hand, signaling everyone to hurry. "We're already late. Don't keep </span><span>Archlord</span><span> </span><span>Iscairn</span><span> waiting. Move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If anyone's scared, they can go back. I'm not about to let anyone embarrass us in front of </span><span>Archlord</span><span> </span><span>Iscairn</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words had the desired effect. This was their big chance, and no one was about to back out now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group quickly set off down the steep mountain path, heading deeper into the </span><span>Virstino</span><span> Mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony stayed close, moving silently on the outskirts, keeping an eye on the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, Anthony suddenly slowed his pace, instinctively turning to look behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night was pitch-black, and the surrounding forest seemed endless, silent, and abandoned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Devil Eye, can you scan the area?" Anthony asked, his instincts tingling with suspicion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm on it. Scanning now..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Completed. There's evidence of human activity 600 feet ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's mind started racing. "This is still the outskirts of the </span><span>Virstino</span><span> Mountains. Could it be an outpost of the Evil Spirit Legion?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No... this is too far out for that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if they've been watching me, then who are these people?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did Anne hire someone? Or is this the Evil Spirit Legion?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With these thoughts in mind, Anthony picked up the pace, but his path started to veer off, separating from the main group.</span></p></div>
