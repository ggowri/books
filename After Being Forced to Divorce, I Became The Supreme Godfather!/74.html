        <h1>Chapter 73 Stand By</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up." Carolyn became angry and said righteously, "I said, Mr. Johnson is a distinguished guest and benefactor of the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Turner family has been developed in Yoland for hundreds of years. How could we be ungrateful and afraid of death? The Turner family swears to stand by Mr. Johnson till death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's eyes were sharp, and her attitude was firm. Then, she said in a deep voice, "Besides, the Evil Spirit Legion has committed many evils, and everyone has the right to kill them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what the reason is, if anyone dares to attack the Turner family, we will destroy them all, even if we have to die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Carolyn Turner, you're indeed a heroine worthy of admiration." Alvin smiled coldly and teasingly, "I'm just afraid that the Turner family can't stop it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For a bastard, a family that has stood for hundreds of years is sacrificed. What a pity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin was very proud because he knew that Anthony would definitely die this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had thought that facing the siege of the Evil Spirit Legion, the Turner family </span><span>would hand over Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he hadn't expected Carolyn, a woman, to be so stubborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alvin was not worried because the Evil Spirit Legion would fight to the death and had more methods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "No matter how strong the Turner family is, they cannot protect Anthony. In the end, the Turner family will sacrifice their lives."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin didn't mind it at all. Instead, he was looking forward to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "If the Evil Spirit Legion can really destroy the Turner family in one fell swoop, it will be an opportunity for the Blake family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without the Turner family, the Blake family can join forces with the Smith family to replace the Turner family and become the top wealthy family in Yoland."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this thought, Alvin became more and more proud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Carolyn Turner." A guard rushed over in panic and shouted, "Bad news. A large number of werewolves are coming to the north gate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? North gate?" Everyone in the Turner family was shocked and obviously panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin's remarks just now had already caused panic among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that guard like this and hearing that werewolves were attacking the north gate, how could everyone not panic?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Carolyn was relatively calm and asked, "Don't panic. How many werewolves are there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not sure. At least thirty. Ms. Carolyn Turner, the guards at the north gate can't hold on any longer... Poof..." Before the man could finish his words, blood spurted out of his mouth, and he fell to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did everyone see that there was a bloody wound more than a foot long on his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn thought, "More than thirty? There are more than a dozen werewolves at the main gate, which is enough to make Dariel and his men fight desperately. But there are surprisingly more than thirty werewolves at the north gate. hoe could it be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She became angry and shouted, "The Evil Spirit Legion is so bold. Are they determined to go to war with the Turner family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin laughed with great satisfaction and said proudly, "Carolyn, the enemy is at the gates. It's not too late for you to regret now. If you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bah." Carolyn turned around and shouted angrily, "Who do you think you are? How dare you call me by my name? Slap him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Alvin could react, a guard walked over and slapped him several slaps in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Alvin's skin was torn, and his face was covered in blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Turner Manor, and how dared he disrespect Carolyn?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After teaching Alvin a lesson, Carolyn ordered, "The rest of you stay and protect Mr. Johnson and Ms. Turner. Everyone else follow me. I will guard the north gate myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the Turner family was in a panic, Carolyn knew very well that she had to boost morale, and the best way was for her to fight in person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, this battle concerned the Turner family's dignity and status, so the Turner family couldn't lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn thought, "We must fight quickly and decisively to eliminate the invading enemies to prevent the support of the Evil Spirit Legion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the person in charge of the Turner family, even though the situation was urgent, Carolyn's mind was still clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Carolyn Turner, wait a moment." Anthony stopped her and said, "Ms. Carolyn Turner, the situation at the north gate is unclear, you should bring all your guards with you. I will protect Ms. Turner. I promise to protect her with my life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well..." Carolyn hesitated for a moment and subconsciously looked at Rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose didn't say anything but held Anthony's hand tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. Thank you, Mr. Johnson." Seeing Rose like this, Carolyn no longer hesitated and said solemnly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, she knew that Anthony was stronger than Dariel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, it was in the Turner Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless the Evil Spirit Legion broke through the Turner Manor's gate, Rose would not be in much danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the north gate, more than thirty werewolves attacked fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The twenty-plus guards outside the gate were no match for them at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn hurried over and saw the guards were already on the verge of collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bastards. You dare to hurt the Turner family. You are seeking death." Carolyn became furious when she saw that the Turner family had suffered heavy losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She leaped from a distance, carrying with her a cloud of dust, and landed with a loud bang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn landed on the ground in an instant, with the dust rising and the earth trembling. There was a dull rumbling sound that was deafening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her violent force knocked all the gathered werewolves out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far away, Mason grinned and said, "Carolyn is here. Set up a formation, trap her to death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he finished speaking, more than thirty werewolves howled to the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, a weird blood mist emanated from their bodies and merged towards Carolyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? What are you doing, you bastards?" Feeling a dangerous aura quickly enveloped her, Carolyn changed her expression slightly.</span></p></div>
