        <h1>Chapter 34 The Real Battle</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The firing commenced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or, to be more precise, Anthony found himself alone, confronting an endless wave of assassins closing in from three sides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bullets hailed from three directions. To shield Helen and Rose from the onslaught at the back, Anthony stood his ground alone at the doorway, a solitary bulwark against the storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His movements were like a ghost's, defying the normal constraints of time and space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every twist of his body was to dodge bullets from multiple angles while retaliating with precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each volley he unleashed cut down assassins with ruthless efficiency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By his own strength, he managed to hold off the relentless tide of killers advancing from three sides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner, who is he? How can anyone possess such terrifying power?" Helen asked, her voice trembling as she watched the scene unfold from the safety of the </span><span>room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose let out a long breath, a relieved smile breaking through her pale face. Her beautiful eyes glimmered with admiration. "I knew he wasn't an ordinary person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen glanced at Rose in surprise. In all her years serving Rose, she had never heard Rose speak so highly of a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Rose yelled, "Not good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen's heart skipped a beat as she whipped her head around to look outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation had shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The assassins, unable to land a shot on Anthony, had abandoned their attempts at precision shooting. Instead, they adopted a brutish but effective tactic: using shields designed to resist high-explosive bullets. Advancing slowly, they held their shields in front of them like mobile covers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's sharpshooting skills were rendered almost useless. Bullets pinged harmlessly off the shields.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was filled with the staccato of relentless impacts, reminiscent of a fierce rainstorm, where each bullet met the shields and fell to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The assassins, inching closer under the protection of their shields, began to close in on him from three sides, tightening the noose around their prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, hide in the room!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose shouted, unable to contain her worry any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen added her voice, "Once your gun loses its advantage, you can't take on so many by yourself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, don't be stubborn. Retreat inside!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anthony only smiled, his eyes gleaming with a feral excitement, "Don't be afraid. That was just the warm-up. Now, it's time for the real battle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he tucked away his M9 submachine gun and drew Dragonfang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of assassins surged forward. Seeing Anthony stow his gun, they thought their moment had come. Like wolves scenting victory, they rushed him, weapons raised high, ready to hack and slash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose's heart leaped into her throat. If Helen hadn't pulled her back, she would have thrown herself into the fray to fight alongside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen pleaded, her voice shaking, "Ms. Turner, calm down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're no match for them. If you go out now, you'll only distract Anthony and make things worse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose frantically tried her phone again, but there was still no signal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fury bubbled up inside her. With a curse, she hurled the phone to the ground. "Damn Dariel! This is all his fault! If he hadn't been sent to pick me up, none of this would have happened! If anything happens to Anthony, I'll never forgive him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen's brows furrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel, the most trusted security captain, was usually reliable and fiercely loyal to Rose. His absence today was glaring and troubling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dark suspicion formed in Helen's mind, but she dared not voice it aloud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, she could only pray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She murmured, "Please let Anthony hold out just a little longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please let the Turner family discover what's happening here and send reinforcements soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The assassins had abandoned their guns, switching to close-quarters combat with cold, brutal weapons. And in a twisted way, that played right into Anthony's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't wanted to waste any more bullets. After all, every round cost money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with Dragonfang in hand and Leopard Avatar granted by Devil Eye, he was more than ready to test his true abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pack of black-clad assassins surged toward him, weapons gleaming in the dim light. But Anthony was a whirlwind of death. His body moved like a cheetah, fluid yet deadly, darting left and right through the crowd. He feinted to the east, only to strike decisively in the west.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp Dragonfang sliced through the air, each strike finding its mark with deadly precision. Every cut was like the kiss of death, reaping lives as easily as a farmer harvesting wheat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony let out a roar of pure, savage joy. He didn't evade the oncoming punch; instead, he confronted it directly, his hand colliding with the assassin's in a ferocious strike, like a tiger's lethal swipe. The assassin's fist shattered beneath his might, bones splintering like brittle twigs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was unstoppable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was strength, speed, or sheer ferocity, Anthony dominated the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a one-man army facing down dozens of enemies, yet he moved with such grace and precision that it was as if he were the one doing the besieging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose and Helen, watching from the room, could hardly believe their eyes. Their astonishment was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't expect that he's not just a sharpshooter but also a great warrior..." Helen murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose's eyes twinkled with a fresh gleam of respect and admiration. "And there's more," she whispered. "He's a maestro in spiritual medicine identification and adept in psychology. He has this uncanny ability to see right through people. He truly understands me. He talks a lot, sure, but he's thoughtful and genuinely kind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart raced as she pieced it all together. Anthony was almost perfect, like her ideal partner.</span></p></div>
