        <h1>Chapter 157 Dragon Avatar</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere around Anthony grew thick with a savage energy that seemed to press against his chest. A dark, oppressive aura hung in the air, and it made his heart race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, </span><span>Necros</span><span>' body trembled, and from every pore, blood mist began to seep out, searing through his black robes. The mist clung to him, swirling eerily in the air around him, almost like a living thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the mist enveloped him, Anthony heard the sickening crack of bones stretching and shifting. It was like firecrackers going off in rapid succession, with every snap followed by another explosive burst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each crack, </span><span>Necros</span><span>' body grew larger, swelling until it seemed like a mountain had risen in front of Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell?!" he gasped, his mouth hanging open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in front of him was no longer human. He was a giant, towering over 30 feet tall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His legs were like thick stone pillars, and his arms were as thick as tree trunks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face twisted into a brutal, terrifying grimace, his eyes glowing blood red like some monstrous creature straight out of hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was frozen in shock, unable to speak, as </span><span>Necros</span><span> let out a deafening laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't the laugh of a man but the howling roar of a beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kid!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm </span><span>gonna</span><span> eat you</span><span> alive</span><span>!" </span><span>Necros</span><span> bellowed, his voice booming like thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The giant's hand swung through the air, massive enough to swallow Anthony whole if it landed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It moved with terrifying speed, faster than it had any right to be given its size.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony barely had time to react, instinctively retreating as the hand came down toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he moved, </span><span>Necros</span><span>' colossal foot slammed down from above, blocking his path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The giant was a blur of power. His clothes ripped apart under his growing form, leaving him barefoot and monstrous, every movement like the crushing force of a landslide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't slow, not by a long shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally, the bigger someone was, the slower they'd be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite towering like a small mountain, </span><span>Necros</span><span> moved with a terrifying speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony barely had a chance to think before the giant's hand ripped through the air, shredding trees like tissue paper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wind from the swing was like a violent storm, sending debris flying in every direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony didn't even see it coming. The next moment, </span><span>Necros</span><span>' palm crashed into his chest, and the force sent him flying through the air like a ragdoll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He soared more than 100 feet, smashing through trees and finally crashing to the ground in a heap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything inside him felt like it had been rearranged, his blood surging violently. Anthony gasped for breath, struggling to make sense of what had just happened. Every inch of his body screamed in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!" </span><span>Necros</span><span>' roar shattered the air as his massive hand slammed down, sending Anthony hurtling through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before Anthony could even steady himself, </span><span>Necros</span><span> was already on top of him, leaping like a mountain crashing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony barely had time to register the danger before the enormous foot came bearing down on him, promising a quick and brutal end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think I'm an easy target?!" Anthony's voice was low, filled with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the words left his mouth, a deep, dragon's roar erupted from his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body trembled with raw power as a massive force surged through his limbs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His muscles swelled, his skin shimmered, and scales began to form, dark and hard, gleaming like dragon armor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Anthony's transformation was complete. He stood firm, his body glowing with an otherworldly aura, as </span><span>Necros</span><span>' foot came crashing down with the force of a falling mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground trembled under the impact, and the sheer power of the blow sent shockwaves through the mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rocks cracked and splintered as if they were made of paper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But </span><span>Necros</span><span> wasn't done. He kicked harder, with all his might, each stomp like a hammer blow, as if trying to turn Anthony into </span><span>a </span><span>paste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when the final kick came down, </span><span>Necros</span><span> let out an unexpected, blood-curdling scream. "Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood surged from beneath his foot, and he staggered back, his eyes wide with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strange blue light flickered in the massive footprint he'd left behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with a roar, Anthony shot out from the rocks, </span><span>Dragonfang</span><span> still gripped tightly in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was he still alive, but he was completely unharmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Necros</span><span> could hardly believe his eyes. After all those stomps, he figured even a bull would have been reduced to nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anthony, empowered by the Dragon Avatar, was no ordinary man. His defenses were insane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just the dragon scales alone were enough to make him invulnerable. No weapon could touch him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Dragon Avatar could withstand anything. He was certain that not even a nuclear blast could break through his defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A nuclear bomb might be a bit of an exaggeration, but regular artillery wouldn't even leave a mark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the power bestowed by the 2.0 version of the Devil Eye. The 1.0 version had granted him Leopard Avatar. Back then, with nothing more than a roar, he had nearly </span><span>made Dariel beg for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Leopard Avatar was terrifying, the Dragon Avatar was a force of nature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of sheer power, Anthony now stood untouchable by any superpower. However, his transformation depended on the Devil Eye, and their power had its limits. He couldn't wield it indefinitely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The duration of the Devil Eye was tied to his own vitality and spirit. To prolong their effect, he had to continue refining his energy through the Energy-absorbing Breathing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was why the Chosen Path's third task, finding the </span><span>Leyline</span><span>, was so crucial. With the </span><span>enormous </span><span>spiritual energy from the</span><span> </span><span>Leyline</span><span>, his vitality could continue to grow without limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was with this resolve that Anthony entered the </span><span>Virstino</span><span> Mountains, determined to succeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blood Shadow, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anthony spat out the grit from his mouth and sneered. "If I kill you, that technique will be mine."</span></p></div>
