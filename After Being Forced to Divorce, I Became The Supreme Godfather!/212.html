        <h1>Chapter 211 Overestimating Yourself</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the sound, everyone turned their heads, and their faces turned pale with shock!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my God, what is that thing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got to be kidding! What kind of monster is that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is... is that Astaroth? How is that even possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst the rising dust, a monstrous figure appeared, standing dozens of feet tall with a body covered in a greenish-black hue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The creature's legs were as thick as stone pillars, with bulging veins snaking across their massive girth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its arms were as thick as a grown man's waist, and its muscles swelled in exaggerated arcs that left everyone speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It stood slightly hunched, its limbs and back bristling with sharp, rigid spikes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Roar!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The monster let out a deafening roar, shaking the ground as it rose to its full height.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the roar came an overwhelming bloodlust that sent chills down everyone's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to the towering behemoth, Anthony looked like an insignificant ant at its feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of its massive feet alone was larger than Anthony's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer disparity was glaring&mdash;one step from the giant could crush Anthony as easily as squashing an insect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This... this is...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blood Shadow? Is this the Blood Shadow that </span><span>Archlord</span><span> </span><span>Iscairn</span><span> mentioned?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Vincent was visibly shaken, his voice trembling as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind fixated on one thought&mdash;Powerful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Incredibly powerful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief moment of shock, Vincent burst into laughter, his tone arrogant. "Just now, who said Anthony was going to win?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You </span><span>fools</span><span>, do you still think Anthony can save you at this point?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I warn you, drop any silly ideas you might have. After I kill Anthony, I'll settle accounts with each and every one of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elders, meanwhile, were utterly paralyzed with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's earlier display of strength had shocked them, and they had believed victory was within reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no one had expected Vincent to have such an ace up his sleeve. In an instant, the Astaroth who had been helpless against Anthony had transformed into this monstrous creature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it was no ordinary monster. Its terrifying size and strength seemed</span><span> </span><span>insurmountable. Even if Anthony were a celestial being, he might not stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony! What do you have to say now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mountainous Astaroth looked down at Anthony, its voice a low, menacing growl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its tone was hoarse and bone-chilling as if its vocal cords were being torn apart with every word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing so close, Anthony could clearly feel the violent, oppressive aura radiating from Astaroth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Astaroth had also mastered Blood Shadow. After all, he was one of the Four Demon Lords, all of whom shared this terrifying ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This fact didn't surprise Anthony much. However, it was clear that Astaroth's body was far larger than </span><span>Necros</span><span>'.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony thought to himself, "Astaroth used to be no more than 32 feet tall, but now he's far beyond that!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>What a sinister technique!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This ability seems to multiply their strength several times over!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's no wonder the Blood Shadow gives the Four Demon Lords the power to fight far beyond their level. If I could get my hands on this demonic technique..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the thought crossed his mind, Anthony's expression tightened. There was a </span><span>reason techniques</span><span> like this were called demonic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he didn't know exactly why, he could sense its sinister nature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were simple, countless people would have mastered it by now. Yet, only these four had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Setting his thoughts aside, Anthony let out a calm smile and said arrogantly, "I'll say it again, nothing impressive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, I will kill you, and no one can stop me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Astaroth could respond, Anthony leaped into the air, soaring dozens of feet high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, he clenched his fist and aimed a devastating punch at Astaroth's massive head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his fist swung forward, an immense force gathered around it, forming a glowing imprint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The imprint shot forward, tearing through the air. In the blink of an eye, it transformed into a three-foot-long burst of energy, flying straight at Astaroth's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Petty tricks!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Astaroth laughed, completely unfazed by the approaching attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The imprint struck with a resounding crash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming force of the punch seemed unstoppable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as the blow landed, it shattered instantly, leaving Astaroth's head completely unharmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Overestimating yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the dust settled, Astaroth sneered, "Is that all the strength you've got? It's not even enough to scratch an itch!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Killing you is as easy as crushing an ant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Astaroth lifted one of its massive feet. Its shadow loomed over Anthony, ready to stomp him out of existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The oppressive aura grew even stronger as the foot rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as Astaroth's foot was about to descend, it paused mid-air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking down, Astaroth noticed something strange. Anthony had inexplicably closed his eyes, his body exuding a faint, unfamiliar energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beneath his swelling muscles, a faint crimson glow flickered. His veins pulsed unnaturally, twisting and writhing like living things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a series of crisp cracking sounds emanated from within his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anthony's muscles expanded rapidly, his bones elongating inch by inch. His once-yellowish skin now gleamed with a mysterious golden light.</span></p></div>
