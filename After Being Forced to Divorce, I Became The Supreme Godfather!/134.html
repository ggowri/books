        <h1>Chapter 133 Catastrophe</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur half-leaned on his chair, eyes fixed on Anne as he pulled a cigar from his pocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man in black stepped forward from his position beside Arthur and lit the cigar with a practiced hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His movements were deliberate and unhurried, his demeanor calm and collected, yet an undeniable aura of arrogance and dominance emanated from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This display of power only made Anne's heart beat faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who said a new player couldn't dominate established territory?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron had stormed into Yoland and swept aside its security companies in a single day, proving his strength and ruthless efficiency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she could bring him under her wing, the Smith family's influence would reach new heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As these calculations ran through Anne's mind, her gaze grew increasingly fixated on Arthur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Anne's reaction, Arthur smirked inwardly and retorted forcefully, "Ms. Smith, do you really think I need someone to back me up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His simple question sent another jolt through Anne. What an overbearing attitude!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But did he really not need backing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne couldn't agree. "Mr. Hastings, your prowess and capabilities are extraordinary. It is already well-known throughout Yoland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However," she continued, "that's just within Yoland. Is Mr. Hastings unaware that from now on, the Evil Spirit Legion will also be involved in Yoland's affairs?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And after tonight's family dinner, we'll all be joining forces with the Evil Spirit Legion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With the Evil Spirit Legion's support, the Smith family commands respect throughout Yoland. Perhaps Mr. Hastings doesn't need a patron, but wouldn't you agree a partnership could be... beneficial?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne raised her wine glass with a seductive smile, her crossed legs deliberately brushing against Arthur's under the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur smiled, his fierce eyes brazenly appraising Anne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze traveled up from her long legs, lingering for a moment on her ample chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he stared directly into Anne's eyes and smiled. "You seem pretty confident about this alliance, Ms. Smith?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course," she replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Arthur's steady gaze, Anne nodded proudly. "To be frank, the Evil Spirit Legion has already reached out to us. They're willing to accept the Smith family, along with other families who wish to join them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just a matter of going through the motions now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Mr. Hastings is willing to cooperate, I can guarantee you'll be well rewarded..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emboldened by his response, Anne grew bolder. Under the table, she reached out with her delicate hand, running a finger across Arthur's knee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh..." Arthur drew out the word meaningfully as he rolled his cigar between his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Anne was waiting expectantly for his nod of approval, Arthur suddenly changed tack. "Do you know why I came here today, Ms. Smith?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because I believe the Smith family is about to face a catastrophe. That's why I'm here to make a deal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Catastrophe?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Make a deal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's smile finally faded as confusion set in. "Mr. Hastings, you must be joking. Does my family look like we're headed for disaster?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll see about that soon enough," Arthur replied with an enigmatic smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Smith, if you hire Draconic Shield, I guarantee the Smith family's complete safety."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The fee is five hundred million dollars per year. During our protection period, Draconic Shield will cover any and all losses Ms. Smith might incur..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five hundred million? Are you out of your mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Alvin walked over. Upon hearing the figure, he exploded, "You're just a newly established company! Who do you think you are?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even Yoland's top security firm only charges thirty million a year. The combined security budget for both the Smith and Blake families barely reaches a hundred million!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Draconic Shield? A company that's barely a few days old, and you dare ask for five hundred million?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hastings, do you think we're made of money, or are you treating us like kids?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne remained silent throughout this exchange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her silence indicated agreement with Alvin's sentiment. Indeed, Arthur's price was outrageous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur didn't seem bothered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a drag from his cigarette and casually replied, "It's just an initial offer. No hard feelings if we can't make a deal. Feel free to think it over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Alvin exploded. "Think what over?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin pressed his lips in disdain and declared arrogantly, "Aaron, is it? Let me warn you. It is the Smith family's turf and this is Yoland. You don't get to throw your weight around here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We invited you here as a courtesy. Don't push your luck!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pledging allegiance to the Evil Spirit Legion is the only way forward. Those who stubbornly resist will only find a dead end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike Anne, Alvin laid all his cards on the table, glaring at Arthur with open hostility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne frowned at Alvin's impulsive outburst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Arthur disagreed, she hadn't planned to show their hand so early.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or rather, she had other ways to bring Arthur on board.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur just smiled faintly, ignoring Alvin completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he looked toward the main entrance and said, "Looks like your trouble's arrived. Maybe handle that first, then we can talk business."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the door, Anthony strolled up casually with Dariel, hands in his pockets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trouble?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne turned to look and burst out laughing. "Mr. Hastings, you're giving him too much credit. Today, he's not stepping foot in the Smith Manor unless he's on his knees!"</span></p></div>
