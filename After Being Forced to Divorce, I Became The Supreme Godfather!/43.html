        <h1>Chapter 42 The Dance</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Anthony was wondering why Jane was approaching the wall, she reached it and waved her hand. A hidden door swung open, revealing a massive underground palace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a fortress-like structure built from granite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It became clear that this was the true heart of the Dragon Guild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enormous dragon-shaped pillars resembled ancient trees, and beside each stood a Dragon Guard draped in black robes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing Jane, they all bowed their heads in unison, saying, "Greetings, Ms. Ronald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane puffed out her chest, pointed at Anthony, and declared with pride, "Everyone, listen up! This is Mr. Anthony Johnson. You will take your orders from him from now on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she led the way and bowed deeply before Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dragon Guards responded with a loud, "Yes, Mr. Johnson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their voices echoed powerfully throughout the underground palace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony nodded and said, "Jane, you're doing an excellent job managing the Yoland branch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane flashed a slight smile and replied, "Thank you, Mr. Johnson. Please come with </span><span>me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly led Anthony deeper into the palace. After turning a corner, they entered a corridor lined with prison cells on either side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they walked further, Anthony suddenly heard the distant howling of a wolf from a cell at the end of the hallway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That sound was all too familiar to him, a reminder of the chaos that followed the assassination attempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you catch the escaped werewolf?" he asked Jane in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had thought Jane brought him here for some confidential briefing, never expecting such a significant surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane nodded and explained, "The Evil Spirit Legion has always been the arch-nemesis of the Godfather Group. Every member of our organization has the authority to eliminate any trace of them without asking for permission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When you and Rose were attacked, I detected the presence of werewolves and led the Dragon Guards to the scene. I managed to capture one just in time, but I didn't have a chance to interrogate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was going to ask my superiors to send someone to escort him back to headquarters, but now that you're here, we can interrogate him together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perfect! Now that we've found the murderer, not only can I clear my name, but we can also uncover the mastermind behind this," Anthony replied enthusiastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following Jane's lead, they soon arrived at the end of the corridor, where a heavily reinforced cell awaited them. As the eight-inch-thick steel door slowly creaked open, a wave of bloodthirsty energy surged out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the center of the cell, the werewolf who had escaped the previous night was suspended in mid-air, shackled by special alloy chains around his neck, hands, and feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of Anthony intensified the werewolf's fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You! You killed my companions! I'm going to devour you!" he roared, thrashing wildly against his restraints, causing the chains to rattle ominously, as if the entire cell were about to collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you speak to Mr. Johnson like that! You deserve a beating!" Jane shouted angrily, grabbing a whip reinforced with steel wire from the nearby rack. She began to strike the werewolf mercilessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each crack of the whip left bloody gashes on the werewolf's skin, tearing it apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were an ordinary person, he would be dying or dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, shockingly, the creature seemed oblivious to the pain, taunting, "Good job! Hit me harder!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The more you hit me, the more I enjoy it! Why don't you let me go and I'll make you feel good?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Missy, I'm going to fuck you hard sooner or later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes gleamed with a predatory hunger as he leered at the graceful Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His constant lewd words and insults to Jane infuriated Anthony. Although he hadn't yet slept with Jane, he subconsciously viewed her as his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't stand to let a werewolf insult her like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked up a mace from the torture rack and began to pummel the werewolf mercilessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the werewolf only grew more incensed, cursing wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Exhausted from the beating, Anthony let out a sigh and gritted his teeth. "Tell me who hired you to assassinate Ms. Turner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolf spat blood at him, laughing maniacally, "Are you tickling me? Go ahead, why don't you kill me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keeping secrets is the honor of the Evil Spirit Legion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fuming, Anthony clenched his fists. "Fine, we'll see about that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he pulled out the Dragonfang dagger, ready to inflict pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane said, "Every member of the Evil Spirit Legion has signed a contract and typically won't confess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But don't worry, Mr. Johnson. I have a plan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's that?" Anthony asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I plan to dance for him," Jane replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dance?" Anthony blinked, taken aback. Was she serious?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane flashed a sultry smile and added, "But Mr. Johnson, you might want to look away while I perform. I fear you won't be able to control yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't control yourself?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony felt more confused and intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a mysterious smile and a wink cast at the werewolf, Jane began her dance.</span></p></div>
