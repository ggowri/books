        <h1>Chapter 111 True Intentions</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's power had surged, and the Devil Eye had evolved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alongside this transformation, his mindset shifted as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was no longer the destitute orphan wandering the streets or the live-in man under someone else's roof.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he was a bona fide metahuman, a powerful Warrior, and a man destined to rise as the next Godfather!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he couldn't even handle someone like Arthur, how could he dream of claiming that title?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur's heart skipped a beat. He hesitated but finally said, "If... if you truly have a way to help me avenge my wife and daughter, then I, Arthur Hastings, will pledge my loyalty to you and follow your every command!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I must ask&mdash;what proof do you have?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur's voice carried anger&mdash;not toward Anthony but toward the Evil Spirit Legion and himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beneath the anger simmered guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He yearned for revenge, yet he knew deep down that such a goal was nothing more than a fool's dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good," Anthony said with a satisfied nod. "But first, I need you to tell me one thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why has the Evil Spirit Legion mobilized such a massive force this time? Their goal to destroy the Turner family cannot be as simple as targeting me or Vincent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because the Evil Spirit Legion wouldn't mobilize such a massive force just because I killed a single werewolf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nor would they recklessly launch an all-out assault on a centuries-old powerhouse simply over someone like Vincent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony had pondered this question endlessly, yet he couldn't piece it together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh..." Arthur let out a wry chuckle. "You're certainly different&mdash;sharp and wise beyond your years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, this siege on the Turner family is not about you or Vincent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vincent was merely the spark..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony waved his hand impatiently. "Enough with the nonsense. Get to the point. Speak."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know..." Arthur shrugged helplessly, his tone apologetic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you courting death?" Anthony's face darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur remained calm and shook his head. "I genuinely don't know. Before this, we had been stationed deep within the Virstino Mountains, lying low.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our orders come from our superiors. We are not allowed to contact them proactively, nor can we leave our designated positions without permission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We received this mission three days ago: infiltrate the assassins sent to kill you and seize Rose alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Capture her alive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony frowned, recalling that the werewolf assassins had indeed tried to capture Rose rather than kill her outright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why? Why capture Rose?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Arthur confirmed. "The original mission was to take her alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But when that mission failed, we were given new orders&mdash;to eliminate the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for the exact reason, I truly don't know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony nodded thoughtfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His suspicions were confirmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Evil Spirit Legion had clearly been planning this for some time. The siege on the Turner family wasn't a spur-of-the-moment decision; it was a meticulously crafted scheme.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what could their true motive be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it all about Rose?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, their goal was to capture Rose alive. When that failed, the directive shifted to annihilating the Turner family entirely&mdash;Rose included.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In essence, they began with a plan to capture one person, only to pivot to wiping out the entire family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given Arthur's current state, he didn't seem to be lying. In fact, there was no reason for him to lie. It appeared he truly didn't know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief moment of thought, Anthony Johnson pressed further. "This superior you mentioned&mdash;can you find a way to contact them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur shook his head helplessly, repeating. "We cannot contact our superiors </span><span>proactively. That is a strict taboo in the Evil Spirit Legion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony frowned. "Then surely you've seen this person? You must at least know what they look like."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur shook his head again. "They wore the same black robe as I do and always hid behind a demonic mask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their voice was raspy, and they had a fiery temper. However..." He hesitated, frowning deeply as if trying to recall something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's patience was wearing thin. "However, what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think it might be a woman..." Arthur muttered. "Even though the voice was low and rough, and the temper volatile, there was a distinct scent about them. Something unique. Strange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's hard to describe, but once you smelled it, it stirred something inside you. A sort of... inexplicable restlessness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Arthur seemed lost in thought, his face betraying a trace of lingering nostalgia, as if he were savoring the memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A woman?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony wasn't particularly surprised by the revelation, but Arthur's expression made him frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's with you?" Anthony asked, his tone laced with irritation. "Even if it's a woman, you've never even seen her face. Is there really any reason for this dreamy look?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?" Arthur blinked, startled out of his reverie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He appeared momentarily disoriented, as though unaware he had zoned out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony didn't dwell on it. He didn't have the patience for such trivialities. Instead, he cut straight to the point. "If you want revenge, it won't be easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First, you'll need to accomplish something for me. Do it well, and you might have your chance at vengeance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you fail, not only will you never avenge your wife and daughter, but I'll personally end your life."</span></p></div>
