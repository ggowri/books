        <h1>Chapter 18 Ms. Turner's Mission</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Jane's guidance, Anthony arrived at her villa. It was a beautifully decorated, cozy little home. The moment he stepped inside, a fresh, pleasant fragrance greeted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was filled with blooming flowers, and every piece of d&eacute;cor was exquisitely crafted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, Jane wasn't just a charming woman; she also knew how to enjoy life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Johnson, whatever you need, I can make it happen," Jane said with a captivating smile as she gestured for Anthony to sit on the plush sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony caught a whiff of her alluring perfume and couldn't help but notice the sparkle in her eyes. He swallowed hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This woman was unbelievably attractive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a fleeting moment, he felt an overwhelming urge to pull her into his arms and hold her close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he knew he couldn't act on that impulse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was his subordinate, and he was still in the midst of the heir's trials. He couldn't afford to act inappropriately with someone under his command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing that staying any longer might cloud his judgment, Anthony quickly found an excuse to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he left, he asked Jane not to reveal his identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane thought for a moment, then smiled. "Mr. Johnson, since you'd prefer to keep your identity a secret, I'll tell others that you once saved my life. That's why I treated you with such respect. Now that the favor has been repaid, we're even."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony nodded, agreeing to her suggestion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the villa, Alvin and Anne, who had been trembling with fear after offending Anthony, had resolved to pack up all their wealth and present it to him, hoping for forgiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then they overheard someone saying that Jane's respect for Anthony was merely her way of repaying a life-saving debt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought Jane was a grateful person, so she had gone to greet Anthony in person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne fumed. "So Anthony used his so-called life-saving favor to threaten Ms. Ronald? I can't believe I thought he was really the Godfather's grandson. What a shameless trick!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do we do now, Alvin?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin replied, "Ms. Ronald has repaid her debt. She has nothing to do with Anthony anymore. Let's stick to the plan. Let's go in and issue the kill order!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That day marked the first trading day of the Dragon Guild, primarily serving as a platform for various transactions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Anthony entered the trading hall, he saw people signing contracts under the supervision of Dragon Guild staff. None of these transactions interested him, so he headed straight to the mission board.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The walls were plastered with mission notices. Some were about finding missing people, some about assassinations, treasure hunts, or seeking partnerships. The rewards ranged from one million to ten million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony scanned the board but didn't find anything suitable. Just as he was feeling disappointed, a commotion erupted nearby. Looking up, he saw a crowd surging toward a transaction booth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had to be a high-reward mission!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony quickly moved closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his dismay, when he managed to squeeze through the crowd, he saw Alvin and Anne sitting behind the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Disgusted, Anthony turned to leave, but Anne's sharp eyes spotted him. She pointed at him and shrieked, "Anthony! Stop right there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take a look at this!" she declared. "Alvin and I, representing the Smith family and the Blake family, are offering a 100-million-dollar bounty for your head!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You pathetic loser, if you kill yourself right now, the 100 million is yours!" she sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin smirked coldly. "With Dragon Guild as a witness, this bounty is legitimate. Every penny will be paid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony glanced at the bounty notice. It did indeed offer 100 million dollars. He was almost tempted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only he could still spend money after dying, he might have chopped off his own head to claim the reward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One hundred million dollars to kill a nobody? That's easy money! We, the Shadow Tiger Gang, accept this mission!" a burly, bald man shouted as he pushed to the front.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can the Shadow Tiger Gang even handle 100 million dollars? Raul, don't bite off more than you can chew. This mission belongs to the Dark Flame Crew," said a man </span><span>in black, his voice dripping with mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raul, the leader of the Shadow Tiger Gang, scowled. "Jorge, are you trying to steal my bounty?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jorge sneered. "It's simple. Whoever kills Anthony first gets the money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! Let's compete fairly. The Serpentine Gang accepts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And the Scorpio Gang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Count us in. We're Azure Gang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Infernal Alliance will join!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mafia Gang too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The one-hundred-million-dollar bounty sent the crowd into a frenzy. Leaders from various gangs attending the event scrambled to register.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To them, Anthony was already as good as dead. Within the Dragon Guild, they couldn't touch him due to the rules. But once the trading day ended, they would all hunt him down like predators going after prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, eighteen gangs had signed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Together, they represented nearly the entire underworld of Yoland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's face darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin and Anne's earlier threats had been empty talk. But now, by officially issuing a kill order in the Dragon Guild, they had made it real. Everyone took it seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would be hard for him to survive in Yoland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony began to feel uneasy. He couldn't possibly stay in the Dragon Guild forever. The greater the danger, the more he needed to arm himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And to do that, he needed money, a lot of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earning that money had just become his most pressing challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Anthony worried and the crowd roared with excitement, a clear voice suddenly rang out. "Ms. Turner has issued a mission."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice wasn't loud, but it carried clearly to every corner of the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone turned to look. Standing at the entrance was a woman dressed in red. Her noble demeanor left everyone momentarily speechless.</span></p></div>
