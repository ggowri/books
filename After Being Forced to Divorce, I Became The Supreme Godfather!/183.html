        <h1>Chapter 182 Draw Them Away</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony? How... how are you even here?" Rose asked in disbelief, still wrapped in Anthony's protective embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn, leaning against his other shoulder, was just as confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had both watched the security footage showing Anthony getting his ass kicked by Aaron, running away like a scared rabbit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd thought all hope was lost, that no one could save the Turner family now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then Anthony had swooped in out of nowhere, rescuing them in the most incredible way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, at Crimson Canyon...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent and his men had finally caught up with Arthur after their chase, only to find him badly injured and unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent didn't mess around. He smacked Arthur awake and barked, "Where is he? Where the hell is Anthony?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck!" Arthur immediately dropped to his knees, trembling. "Please, Mr. Vincent Turner, spare me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That bastard Anthony&mdash;he's sneakier than a fox. He played me, acting all hurt before jumping me when my guard was down. I screwed up, fell right into his trap, and then&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" Vincent cut him off, his patience wearing thin. "Just tell me which way Anthony ran!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well..." Arthur hesitated before continuing, "Before they knocked me out, I saw him running south. He's probably headed back to Yoland."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know I screwed up. Please, show some mercy, Mr. Vincent Turner." Arthur begged </span><span>desperately, ignoring his bloody wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After him!" Vincent barked, waving his hand dismissively at Arthur. "We're not stopping until Anthony's dead!" He was too focused on the chase to deal with Arthur now. Anthony was wounded&mdash;he couldn't have gotten far!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold up&mdash;" Just as they were about to leave, Mordred's eyes narrowed as he grabbed </span><span>Necros</span><span> and Malakar's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mordred turned to Vincent with a serious look. "</span><span>Anthony's</span><span> always got something up his sleeve. What if he's trying to bait us into leaving?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Vincent froze for a moment before asking, "Lord Mordred, are you suggesting Anthony plans to rescue Rose from the Mines alone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A slight smirk played across his face as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mordred ignored Vincent's expression and pressed on. "It's not out of the question."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh! No way." Vincent shook his head with absolute certainty. "First off, Anthony isn't nearly strong enough for something like that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And after taking such a beating? You really think he'd risk going to the mines alone? Lord Mordred, we're wasting time here. We need to go after him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No." Mordred shook his head again firmly. "I'm not taking any chances. I'm heading back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Astaroth. "You take the men and go after him. I'll keep watch at the mines."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it." Neither of them paid any attention to Vincent as they made their decision. Astaroth nodded in agreement, and without so much as a glance at Vincent, Mordred strode away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent knew better than to argue when they were like this. He could only bow respectfully to Astaroth and say, "Lord Astaroth, let's move out and catch up to him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Vincent could finish speaking, Astaroth's body tensed like a coiled spring before he shot forward with ghost-like speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, </span><span>Necros</span><span> and Malakar darted off in different directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The</span><span>y</span><span> moved so fast that it was almost impossible to track them with the naked eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were going all out, searching the area for any trace of Anthony at breakneck speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four brothers worked together like a well-oiled machine. Once Mordred suggested Anthony might be trying to draw them away, they didn't waste another second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anne! Get to the secret chamber right now! I think Anthony's trying to bait us away from there. Move it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing how worked up the Four Demon Lords were </span><span>getting,</span><span> Vincent wasn't taking any chances. He immediately called Anne and ordered her to check the chamber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Got it. I'm on it! Everyone, to me, now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Anne hung up, she sprang into action, gathering a group of men and rushing to the valley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The timing couldn't be more perfect. There was Anthony, helping Rose and Carolyn out of the secret chamber, supporting them on either side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The valley wasn't huge, and with only one way out, Anthony had barely taken a step </span><span>when he came face to face with a gang of black-clad figures charging toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony? You actually had the guts to show up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes met, and Anne's surprise quickly turned to a cold smirk. "Well, well. You're not just useless. You're a sneaky little bastard too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good thing Mr. Vincent Turner was smart enough to see through your little scheme."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But tough luck for you. You walked right into my trap, and now I get to claim all the glory for taking you down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, black-clad figures swarmed in quickly, blocking off the exit. A rough count put their numbers at no less than three hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd wasn't just Evil Spirit Legion members either. There were people from the Smith family and other major </span><span>familie</span><span>s too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they'd headed to the </span><span>Virstino</span><span> Mountains earlier, Anne and the other families had brought their elite bodyguards&mdash;all of them skilled fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with all these forces combined, they made one hell of a threatening army!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Anthony's face darkened. Ignoring Anne completely, he turned to Carolyn. "Aunt Carolyn, we need to bust out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I..." Carolyn furrowed her brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that she didn't want to fight. Vincent had injected her with some kind of drug that suppressed her elemental powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Right now, she couldn't even fight off a kid.</span></p></div>
