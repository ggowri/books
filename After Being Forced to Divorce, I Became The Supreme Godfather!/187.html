        <h1>Chapter 186 Kneel</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The offer seemed tempting on paper. Not only would Anthony escape death, but he'd also gain control of the Turner family and become Yoland's leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mordred's proposal was the kind of fast-track to power that would make most people's heads spin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent and Anne</span><span> had proved that</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Anthony, it meant nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the grandson of the </span><span>Velmor</span><span> Godfather and heir to the Godfather Group, Anthony knew better. The Evil Spirit Legion and the Godfather Group were mortal enemies, like oil and water, they'd never mix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Asking him to join the Legion was like asking a cat to swim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, Mordred didn't know any of this. That explained his smug confidence in making the offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony let out a soft chuckle, tightening his grip on </span><span>Dragonfang</span><span>. "You know what?" he said with a hint of mockery in his voice. "I might consider joining the Legion... if you sweeten the deal a bit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh?" Mordred raised an eyebrow, taking the bait. "What else could you possibly want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony walked forward with casual confidence. "Kneel before me and swear your loyalty. Maybe I'll think about it," he said with an exaggerated drawl, his mockery becoming even more obvious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're </span><span>asking for death</span><span>!" Mordred's face twisted with rage before Anthony could even finish his taunt. He charged forward like a bull seeing red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each footfall from Mordred's massive frame thundered against the ground like war drums. As he charged, waves of murderous intent rolled off him, growing stronger with each step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony threw his head back and laughed, standing his ground. His grip tightened on his weapon as he rushed to meet Mordred head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside him, his dragon power surged desperately, pushing itself to the limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A silvery-white glow spread across Anthony's skin, shimmering like scales in the sunlight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, they closed the gap. Mordred swung his blood-red spear in a deadly arc.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony met the challenge, his whole body tensing as </span><span>Dragonfang</span><span> burst with an icy blue light. He thrust the blade toward Mordred's midsection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was a dangerous difference in their weapons. </span><span>Dragonfang</span><span> was barely eighteen inches long, while Mordred's crimson spear stretched nearly ten feet. In a weapon clash, reach could mean everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing he was </span><span>outmatched,</span><span> Anthony couldn't risk a head-on clash. As the spear descended, he executed a Whirlwind Step, his body twisting </span><span>at</span><span> an impossible angle to avoid the deadly thrust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the spear missed his vital points by inches, Mordred managed to deflect Anthony's </span><span>Dragonfang</span><span> in the same instant. Anthony saw his chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a split-second decision, he made his </span><span>Dragonfang</span><span> vanish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fingers clenched into a tight fist, which began to glow with an otherworldly light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mortal flesh channeled an incredible burst of power and speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surprise attack caught Mordred off guard, landing squarely on his shoulder. "Damn," Anthony thought. He'd been aiming for Mordred's heart, but his opponent was just too fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even more frustrating, Mordred's massive frame barely swayed from the impact. His defense was absolutely insane!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You fight without honor!" Mordred growled. "Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At such close range, however, Mordred's spear had become more of a liability than an advantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spear in his hand vanished as his massive fist came crashing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anthony had anticipated this move perfectly. Before the punch could land, he pivoted sharply, driving his elbow straight into Mordred's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lightning-fast counter caught Mordred completely off guard. The elbow strike, even more devastating than a punch, forced him to stumble backward. Yet Mordred managed to keep his footing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Mordred could retaliate, Anthony spun into action again. He launched himself into the air, rotating a full 180 degrees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His right leg whipped around like a steel cable, cutting through the air as it aimed for Mordred's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed and fluid connection of his moves left Mordred stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air crackled with electricity as Anthony followed up with another strike. His fingers spread wide like a tiger's claws, sparks dancing at his fingertips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slashed across Mordred's chest, tearing through his shirt and leaving bloody scratches on his dark skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Killing Kick!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony seized his moment, launching himself into a perfect 360-degree spin before unleashing a devastating roundhouse kick aimed straight at Mordred's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The powerful strike connected, finally sending Mordred's massive frame flying through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer force behind the blow carried Mordred through three massive trees, each thicker than a man's body, splintering them like toothpicks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without missing a beat, Anthony gripped </span><span>Dragonfang</span><span> and charged forward with incredible speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sword gleamed with an eerie blue light while his eyes burned with unmistakable killing intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though his relentless attacks hadn't broken through Mordred's defenses yet, they had him completely overwhelmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If bare hands couldn't crack that defense, Anthony reasoned, maybe </span><span>Dragonfang</span><span> would do the trick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Anthony had predicted, his flood of attacks had pushed Mordred into a corner. His fury was building. One moment of carelessness had put him at a disadvantage he couldn't overcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was it&mdash;time to end this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony rushed in for the kill, his murderous intent reaching its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Argh!" Mordred's voice boomed across the battlefield. "You bastard. I'll tear you apart!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as Anthony closed in, Mordred let out an earth-shattering roar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, a mysterious force exploded within him as the crimson mist began to rise from his body.</span></p></div>
