        <h1>Chapter 1 Birthday Gifts</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Yoland's hottest nightclub, the VIP room was buzzing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin Blake, the heir to the Blake family fortune, had gone all out for his birthday bash. The air was thick with designer perfume and brown-nosing, everyone trying to catch the golden boy's eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Check it out</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>a</span><span> limited-edition Lambo for Mr. Blake! May you always stay in the fast lane!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got a Rolex Daytona, Mr. Blake. Here's to crushing it for years to come!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"1945 </span><span>Roman&eacute;e</span><span>-Conti, straight from Sotheby's. Happy birthday, Mr. Blake. May your life be as smooth as this vintage!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The one-upmanship was real, each gift more extravagant than the last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the back, Anne</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>draped in a red evening gown that hugged her figure like a second skin</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>hissed at her husband Anthony Johnson. "Where's the gift I told you to get? Move it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony shuffled awkwardly, clutching a tiny package. "Got some, uh, premium coffee beans. A friend hooked me up from Hanker City. Wish Mr. Blake... good health and all the best."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Some cheap coffee beans?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room went dead quiet. Every head swiveled toward Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His little package looked like a joke in a sea of luxury watches, supercars, and thousand-dollar wines. Side-eyes and smirks spread through the crowd like wildfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bro, you seriously thought coffee beans would cut it with Mr. Blake? That's straight-up pathetic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For real. What a typical loser!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room exploded with laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Alvin couldn't help but snicker. "Are you kidding me, Anthony? A box of coffee beans? That's some dollar store bullshit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The laughter got louder, and Anthony felt his face burning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a trophy husband living off his wife's measly three hundred bucks a month allowance, he couldn't exactly ball out on gifts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you really </span><span>wanna</span><span> impress me," Alvin lounged back, smirking like the cat that ate the canary, "I know exactly what I want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's eyes flashed with desperate determination. "Name it. Whatever it takes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Anne was thirsty for that Blake family connection, and Alvin was the key. For his wife's happiness, he'd do anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin's smirk turned predatory. "Oh yeah? What if I want... your smoking hot wife?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's face went dark, fists clenching. "The fuck did you just say? Don't you dare talk about my wife like that! I won't&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Count me in!" Anne's voice sliced through the tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She strutted toward Alvin like a cat on the prowl, eyes locked on his, rocking that sex kitten smile. "Since Mr. Blake's interested, I'm all yours - your birthday present. Here's to more money and... better times in bed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony froze, heart hammering. "Honey, what are you saying? How can you&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind short-circuited. His wife, his supposedly pure, faithful wife, was offering herself up like a fucking party favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up, you piece of shit. I'm done with your pathetic ass."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne didn't spare him a glance. Just slid onto Alvin's lap like she owned it, looking down at Anthony with pure contempt and hate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To be honest, I married you for your connections. But you're useless now, so this marriage is over. Me and Mr. Blake? We're the real deal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin grabbed her waist, grinning like a shark. "Best birthday gift ever!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey Anthony, </span><span>wanna</span><span> know something fun? Your wife - the one you couldn't touch for three fucking years? Been riding my dick the whole time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tonight, I'm </span><span>gonna</span><span> fuck her right in front of you. How's that sound?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You fucking assholes! I'll kill you both!" Anthony snapped, seeing red as he lunged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two brick bodyguards quickly stepped in, locking him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin smirked. "Watch close, she's all mine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slapped her ass. "Suck my dick."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Alvin's command, Anne dropped like it was her job.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Fuck no! You're my wife, </span><span>goddamnit</span><span>!" Anthony lost it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne shot him an ice-cold look. "You're done. Finished. Losing everything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right there, in front of everyone, she unzipped Alvin's pants and went to town on his dick like a pro.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's eyes nearly popped out, thrashing like a wild animal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin roared with laughter. "Get this piece of shit out! Beat his ass and throw him out naked!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fucking clown, thinking he could crash my party!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards went to work, stripped him to his boxers and dragged him out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You fucking whore! Sucking his dick right in front of me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll fucking regret this! Mark my words!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch your back. I'm coming for all of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His screams echoed through the halls as they dragged him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In those final seconds, Anthony saw the real her - his "innocent" wife with another man's cum on her lips, smirking like a demon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was staring, their faces screaming "what a complete buffoon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right there, Anthony's world imploded. He'd just become Yoland's biggest joke, every guy's cautionary tale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sky opened up, rain hammering down. Anthony sprawled out on the street, letting the cold drops blast his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three years with Anne played through his mind like a bad movie, and he finally got it - he'd been nothing but her puppet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her, he was just another sucker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raw fury coursed through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">They'd pay. Every last one of them would fucking pay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face twisted in rage, his mind screaming for revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then suddenly, the rain stopped. Anthony's eyes cracked open to find a massive black umbrella hovering above him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following it up, he spotted some old dude in a suit that probably cost more than his life. Behind him stood an army of stone-faced guys in black, looking straight out of a mafia movie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fleet of blacked-out luxury rides lined the street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who </span><span>are</span><span>..." Anthony croaked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man's voice shook with emotion. "Mr. Johnson, we've been looking everywhere! Your grandfather</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>he's the Godfather of </span><span>Velmor</span><span>! A real kingpin! He sent us to bring you home... to make you the next Godfather!"</span></p></div>
