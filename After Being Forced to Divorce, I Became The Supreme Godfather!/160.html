        <h1>Chapter 159 Give Up</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A towering figure, built like a mountain, his strength and defense were no surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what shocked Anthony was how fast </span><span>Necros</span><span> was. He was just as quick as before, maybe even faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony had thought that after the transformation, </span><span>Necros</span><span> would lose the ability to use his usual techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he was still pulling them off, and with more power than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Necros</span><span>' strength made Anthony feel small, a sense of helplessness creeping in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that he was weak. </span><span>Necros</span><span> was just a fucking beast. His skills were on another level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a B-level Warrior, wielding the power at C level was beyond rank fighting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony could fight above his weight too, but only with his Devil Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was his trump card, his deadliest weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The way he's moving, there's no obvious weak spot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But when he used Blood Shadow Saber earlier, his internal energy dipped."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seems like maintaining his form and using those techniques costs him his essence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Devil Eye gave a quick, precise analysis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony smirked. No wonder </span><span>Necros</span><span> hadn't used the Blood Shadow Saber more. It was just too costly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Essence was everything for the Warriors and Metahumans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could burn it for short bursts of strength, but it took forever to recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one wasted it unless they had no choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, keeping up his defense costs him essence too?" Anthony asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yep."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony straightened up, cracking his neck and brushing off the dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grinned. This fight was about to get interesting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Necros</span><span> was charging at him like a raging bull, smashing through trees and rocks in his path. He was fast, and his power was terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anthony was ready. The second </span><span>Necros</span><span> got within range, Anthony whipped out the Inferno Gatling gun from his Dragon Ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A storm of bullets tore through the air, lighting up the dark forest. The sound was deafening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Necros</span><span> froze for a second, eyes wide in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ordinary guns wouldn't faze him, but the Inferno Gatling was a whole different monster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer volume of bullets was enough to make even </span><span>Necros</span><span> hesitate. He couldn't take that head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He twisted his body, veering sideways to dodge the firestorm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anthony was already one step ahead. He adjusted the gun's angle, cutting off </span><span>Necros</span><span>' escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every bullet that hit shattered the ground, splintered trees, and sent rocks flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Necros</span><span> kept running, but the bullets followed him like a relentless, fiery tide. He was fast, but not fast enough to outrun the Inferno Gatling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each burst, blood exploded from his body, but even that couldn't slow him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Gatling's firepower was powerful, but it didn't break through his defenses. It tore his skin and spilled blood, but he kept pushing forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His defenses were insane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most B-level Warriors would have been shredded to pieces by now, but </span><span>Necros</span><span> just kept moving, his speed unaffected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The constant barrage was burning through Anthony's funds at an alarming rate, each shot adding up fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But knowing </span><span>Necros</span><span> was the one really paying the price, draining his essence with every bullet, gave Anthony a sense of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Necros</span><span> snarled, finally losing his cool. "Where the hell did you get that gun?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony didn't respond. Every time </span><span>Necros</span><span> slowed down, he was hit with another barrage of bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They weren't lethal, but they hurt. And with the constant barrage, it wouldn't take long before </span><span>Necros</span><span>' defenses cracked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maintaining that defense was draining his essence. Even if </span><span>Necros</span><span> didn't fall right away, Anthony could outlast him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony laughed, the Inferno Gatling still roaring in his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The world around him was being reduced to rubble. Trees were toppled. Rocks turned </span><span>to dust, and the land itself seemed to tremble beneath the storm of bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Necros</span><span> was trapped. There was nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give up," Anthony shouted, aiming the gun directly at him. "Surrender, and I'll let you live."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Necros</span><span> was strong, and his technique was impressive, which really intrigued Anthony.</span></p></div>
