        <h1>Chapter 28 The Truth Unveiled</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Last call! Is there any other bidder? If not, these two will find their new owner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane, the auctioneer, called out thrice, her voice ringing clear across the room. Satisfied that no further bids were coming, she brought the gavel down with a sharp crack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A ripple of applause swept through the venue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The auction spotlight shone on two Eldergleam Fungus specimens, where one was authentic and the other a clever imitation. Anthony secured the counterfeit, labeled A, for a close 5.01 million dollars, whereas B, which captured the crowd's favor, was won by Alvin at an astonishing bid of 50 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The staff members came forward, offering both Eldergleam Fungus specimens to Anthony. He grasped the one marked A, his face breaking into a self-satisfied smirk. "Thank you for your generous contribution, Ms. Turner. Please accept this as my gift to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose forced a smile, her eyes betraying a flicker of doubt. "Anthony, are you certain this one is real?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony nodded confidently. "Absolutely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Helen, her patience worn thin, burst out, "Are you blind? Even a child could see that this thing is a fake!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, Ms. Turner just gave you 30 million dollars as a reward, and you waste it on this cheap imitation? That's disgraceful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And thanks to you, Ms. Turner lost her shot at the genuine article! What penalty do you think you've earned for that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose, despite her suspicions, couldn't bear to embarrass Anthony. She smiled weakly, silencing Helen. "It's alright, Helen. I like this one. Thank you, Anthony."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My pleasure," Anthony replied smoothly. "This thousand-year-old treasure will surely benefit your health."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose, though convinced it was a sham, smiled and nodded, unable to bring herself to expose him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside her, Helen seethed, eyes flashing daggers at Anthony. Her lips were pursed in a fierce pout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the other side of the room, Alvin let out a laugh. "Anthony, if the one you snagged for five million dollars is a thousand years old, then just how old do you reckon the one I got for fifty million is?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are two here, and only one's the real deal. You can't seriously believe yours is the authentic one, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, unfazed, replied coolly, "Of course I do. Mine is the true thousand-year-old Eldergleam Fungus. Yours is a mix of hundred to three-hundred-year-old specimens. They may have some medicinal value, but they pale in comparison to mine. And as for price, it's nowhere near fifty million dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin scoffed. "Bullshit! Mine is the real deal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't believe me, why not ask Ms. Smith, the owner of it, to reveal the truth?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony had walked right into the trap. The room buzzed with anticipation, everyone eager to see him proven wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Smith, please!" the crowd clamored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, which one's the real deal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne rose, her eyes lingering on Anthony for a moment. For a fleeting second, she pitied him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She whispered, "Am I being too harsh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her heart quickly hardened. Anthony had weaseled his way in here with nothing but clever tricks. He was never meant to belong in her world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Rose with earnest eyes and said, "Ms. Turner, my hope was for you to acquire the authentic thousand-year-old Eldergleam Fungus. That's why I reached out to Anthony last night."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?" Rose's eyes locked onto Anthony with a mix of curiosity and suspicion. "Did Ms. Smith perhaps suggest to you that this one's the real Eldergleam Fungus?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night before, Anne had bared her soul, stripping off her clothes and kneeling before Anthony, urging him to believe that A was the genuine article. In this, Rose's </span><span>suspicions had been correct.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, on the verge of nodding in confirmation, was cut off by Anne's cold, cutting words, "Wrong!" Anne sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner, I told Anthony repeatedly last night that A was a fake. I begged him to help you secure B. But instead, this despicable man chose to sabotage your chances, all to save a few miserable coins!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He had the audacity to gift you a counterfeit Eldergleam Fungus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This counterfeit is toxic. Ingesting it would be detrimental to your health! Ms. Turner, it seems he is intentionally trying to poison you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I suggest that you investigate his true identity. Discover who sent him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Rose turned to Anthony with a look of sheer disbelief as her face drained of color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raised in a powerful family, she had witnessed the darkest corners of human greed and betrayal, where people killed their own kin for profit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's words were like a match to dry tinder, igniting fears that had long slumbered in the recesses of her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did Anthony seem so in tune with her? He must have conducted an exhaustive investigation into her background beforehand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His intention was clearly to get close to her, only to seize the right moment to harm her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice trembled as she confronted him. "Anthony, were you sent to harm me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, caught off guard by the turn of events, stammered awkwardly, "I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell the truth!" Helen interjected sharply, her eyes flashing dangerously. "Or you'll face death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony tried to defend himself. "I... I don't know what it will take for you to believe me. But this is the real one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin laughed, arguing, "Still trying to lie! Ms. Smith, the true owner of the Eldergleam Fungus, has already spoken. Are we to believe she doesn't know her own merchandise?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Smith, I managed to secure the real one. Would you join me? Let's make the presentation of this ancient, thousand-year-old treasure to Ms. Turner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner, I wish to offer it to you as a gift, jointly from Ms. Smith and myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for Anthony, he is a disgraced loser, cast out by Ms. Smith. He embodies laziness and greed. Don't let his charm fool you. Keeping your distance would indeed be the wisest course of action."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled in Rose's eyes, her heart shattering into a thousand pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was starting to feel a creeping conviction that Anthony was being orchestrated by someone, perhaps with the intent to get close to her only to cause her harm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But a part of her still clung to hope, refusing to let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Were the embraces and joyful moments they shared just yesterday nothing but a facade?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Never before had she felt such cheer and happiness, and in her heart, she had, quite on her own, crowned Anthony as her confidant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it possibly be that all of this was just an illusion, a beautifully crafted lie?</span></p></div>
