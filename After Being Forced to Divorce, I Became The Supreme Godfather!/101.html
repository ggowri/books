        <h1>Chapter 100 Potent Healing</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle outside was earth-shattering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dull roar was unceasing, and the ground trembled violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heavy door of the safe house, crafted from fine steel, shut out all the chaos the moment it closed, leaving the interior tranquil and peaceful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose was frantic with worry, disregarding everything else as she helped Anthony to the bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She desperately activated her healing power to tend to Anthony's wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Anthony's injuries were too severe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose had already used her healing power once before, and her strength was significantly depleted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remnants of her power were utterly insufficient to heal Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony! Please don't!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose realized that as well. Her heart ached, and she was frantic, wiping away tears while desperately trying to ignite her power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen couldn't bear it, rushing over to hold Rose back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No. I have to save Anthony."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner, please calm down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen pleaded urgently, "Ms. Turner, I beg you. You're already very weak. If you </span><span>force your power, it might cost you your life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid to die if it means saving Anthony."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose pushed Helen away once more, her gaze unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she shuddered, and a fine mist enveloped her arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mist traveled down her slender arms, gathering in her palms and transforming into a mighty healing power that surged into Anthony's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Rose's complexion also visibly paled, her weakness becoming increasingly apparent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner. Please don't."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen was terrified and began to wail, "Ms. Carolyn Turner said that unless it's absolutely necessary, you must not burn your essence to heal others..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Helen could finish, a stream of blood suddenly gushed from the corner of Rose's mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Rose paid no heed, still desperately igniting her power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen tried with all her might to pull her away, but it was to no avail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No. Don't..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The potent healing power flooded into Anthony's body. He gradually regained consciousness, slowly opening his eyes and shaking his head at Rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony... Thank goodness, Anthony, you're finally awake."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose screamed in delight, throwing herself into his arms, crying tears of joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose then waved to Helen and said, "Helen, you may leave us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen was taken aback, staring at Rose in confusion. She advised, "Ms. Turner, please don't do anything rash..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave now." Rose's tone became stern before Helen could finish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Ms. Turner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen reluctantly exited the bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony disregarded the situation and said to Rose, "Ms. Turner, I won't die just yet. You must stop using your superpower. Otherwise, you will die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No." Rose shook her head and said somewhat awkwardly, "Anthony, actually, I have another way to save you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose's pale face uncontrollably flushed with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's heart skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Rose's treatment, he had recovered quite a bit, and his mind was much clearer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of shyness, Rose asked softly, her face red, "Anthony, do you love me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he love her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose was the acknowledged goddess of Yoland, the dream lover of countless men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Anthony love her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I love you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony nodded seriously without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he didn't love her, why would Anthony risk his life to protect her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because of the Chosen Path but also because of his love for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their brief time together, Rose had fallen irrevocably in love with Anthony, and he with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Anthony nod, Rose blushed and asked again, "Then do you want me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heaven knew how much courage it took Rose to ask that question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony nodded again without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By this point, he had pretty much guessed what Rose's method was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The union of a man and a woman was the most effective way to heal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Anthony was also eager to unite with Rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second task of the Chosen Path was to win over Rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he completed the task of the Chosen Path, he would not only receive unexpected rewards, but his Devil Eye could also potentially make a breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the Devil Eye evolved to 2.0, Anthony's strength would soar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that case, the werewolf army outside would be no concern at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony... be gentle. Don't hurt me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's heart fluttered as Rose, blushing, nestled into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body was soft and warm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint fragrance wafted into his nose, instantly arousing Anthony's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seemingly considering Anthony's injuries, Rose took the initiative, gently removing his tattered shirt from the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her warm hands slowly explored his abdomen, clumsily undoing his belt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, Rose stopped. She whispered, "Anthony, you do it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony swallowed hard and turned over, pressing Rose beneath him.</span></p></div>
