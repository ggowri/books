        <h1>Chapter 67 Total Ban</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Anthony's words, Anne and Alvin's faces turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obvious he was talking about them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Humiliated in front of Rose and everyone else, they could not hold back their anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin snapped, "Anthony, you pretty boy! Who are you calling pests? Don't forget, you're just a nobody risking your life on experimental drugs! What right do you have to compare yourself to us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne, gritting her teeth, added, "Exactly! Don't think that being Ms. Turner's guest makes you untouchable! For all we know, those drugs in your body are already eating away at you. You won't last long! Ms. Turner, give us a chance, and the Blake family and Smith family will bring immense benefits to the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I guarantee, we're far more valuable than Anthony could ever be!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose's once radiant smile darkened instantly. Her beautiful eyes filled with disgust and fury. A kind-hearted woman since childhood, this was the first time she had felt such loathing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony is my savior and a benefactor to the Turner family. Speaking about him like this is a direct insult to me and my family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've done my homework on you two. You, Anne, and Alvin sacrificed your morals for petty self-interest, shamelessly conspiring together. And you, Anne, cheating while married, You are disgraceful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After being caught by Anthony, not only did you show no remorse, but you escalated your actions, driving him out of the house and putting a bounty on his head. Utterly despicable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I must thank you. Your shamelessness led me to Anthony, the greatest gift heaven could give me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To honor Anthony, I am announcing my first order as the heir of the Turner family. Effective immediately, the Turner family and all its affiliates are prohibited from working with the Blake family and Smith family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone collaborating with these families will be seen as enemies by me, Rose, and the Turner family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To everyone here, if you wish to side with the Blake family or Smith family, you may leave now. You are no longer welcome!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose was truly furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never been so angry or spoken so harshly in one breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her sweet voice, though melodious, carried an undeniable authority, sending chills down everyone's spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin and Anne were like drenched rats, utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had come today to curry favor with Rose and the Turner family, only to end up being labeled enemies instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their actions had brought not only themselves but also their families to the brink of ruin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if outsiders forgave them, their own families would never let them off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner, please calm down! We were only joking! We're old friends with Anthony...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, for old times' sake, say something on our behalf!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears brimmed in their eyes as they turned to Anthony, pleading miserably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Anthony could respond, Jane spoke up sharply, "Ms. Turner is absolutely right! Such shameless people are a waste of air and a stain on our sight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"On behalf of the Dragon Guild, I hereby declare all partnerships with the Blake family and Smith family terminated! Their membership is revoked, and they are permanently banned from setting foot in the Dragon Guild! Anyone associating with these families will be seen as our enemy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, do as you see fit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another bombshell dropped!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose's words might have been dismissed as impulsive, but Jane's declaration carried the weight of deliberation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the two biggest powers in Yoland, the Turner family and the Dragon Guild, simultaneously cutting ties with the Blake and Smith families, it was a death sentence for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The representatives of the various families present were all driven by self-interest. Previously, they had believed Anthony was the King Tiger, and they were eager to align themselves with him immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they certainly wouldn't risk offending the Turner family and Jane, two powerful forces, just because of the Blake family and the Smith family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, people distanced themselves from Alvin and Anne as if they were carriers of the plague.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We sever all ties with the Blake and Smith families!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner and Ms. Ronald are absolutely right. Alvin and Anne are shameless scum!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such brazen individuals don't deserve to live among us! From now on, we stand with Ms. Turner and Ms. Ronald to completely ban the Blake and Smith families!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some even began spitting at Alvin and Anne, throwing stones their way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adulterers! Shameless dogs like you don't belong among us. Leave now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin and Anne became the target of everyone's scorn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrified, they could scarcely believe how a single word from Anthony had turned them into public enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaving the banquet was not their biggest fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What terrified them most was the inevitable punishment awaiting them back in their families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a city as vast as Yoland, there was no longer any place for them.</span></p></div>
