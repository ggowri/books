        <h1>Chapter 36 Resurrection from Despair</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, through the clash moments ago, realized his current prowess was insufficient against a mutant werewolf; at best, he could ensure his own escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, three such beasts loomed before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their savage expressions sent a chill down his spine. For the first time, he tasted the true taste of murderous intent, nudging him toward despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clutching his dagger, he pressed his back against the door, marshaling every ounce of his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From afar, Alvin, witnessing the scene, leaped from his car with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Werewolves! Three of them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Never thought my bounty would lure such formidable foes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen up, my friends! Slay Anthony, and I'll throw in another ten million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words struck a nerve, wounding the werewolf's pride. The nearest one suddenly lunged, kicking him aside with ferocious force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin crashed onto the car's roof, blood spewing from his mouth, while inside, Anne was so terrified she lost control of her bladder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, after sending Alvin flying with a kick, the werewolf resumed his original stance, joining the other two in fixing their predatory stares on Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne was tempted to abandon Alvin, yet she knew her claim to the Smith family throne depended on him and the support of his family. Swallowing her fear, she dragged the wounded Alvin into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't leave!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not every day you see a werewolf in action, so I've got to watch this to the end!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I must witness Anthony's demise, torn apart by werewolves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin clutched his chest, spat out a mouthful of blood, and spoke through clenched teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trio of werewolves advanced on Anthony with deliberate steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolf who had struck first flashed a grin, "Boy, leave now, and I might just let you live."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony gritted his teeth. "You're after Ms. Turner, aren't you? Bold move! But with me here, you'll fail!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough talk! I'll handle him; you two, inside for the kill!" another werewolf commanded, charging at Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a roar, Anthony met the charge head-on. He managed to fend off the first, but the other two bolted for the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was ready. He squeezed off two rounds from the M9 submachine gun in his grip, both bullets finding their mark in the werewolves' chests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bullets, capable of piercing steel, only managed to push the two werewolves back, </span><span>failing to inflict any harm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The might of the mutant werewolf once again expanded Anthony's understanding of their formidable power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cursed, "Damn it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eliminate them all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the gun now at his back, Anthony wielded the dagger, engaging in a desperate melee with the trio.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each clash was a tempest, threatening to overwhelm him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, retreat was not an option.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to protect the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If not, the moment those werewolves breached the room, Rose and Helen would be in grave danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the desolate castle strewn with the fallen, four figures danced a deadly ballet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's Leopard Avatar, facilitated by Devil Eye, was rudimentary at best, and being his first attempt, there was a noticeable gap in prowess compared to the seasoned combat experience of the werewolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he was outnumbered, facing three werewolves alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also had to constantly guard the doorway, thwarting any attempt by the werewolves to break through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he was grievously wounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most harrowing moment came when the werewolf, with a ferocious snarl, sent him hurtling through the air. His body slammed against the wall with a sickening thud. Darkness clouded his vision, and he was just barely clinging to consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, fueled by sheer will, he rose again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The eerie glow of Devil Eye, once piercing and bright, flickered and rapidly dimmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel his mental reserves draining away, like sand slipping through his fingers. The power of Devil Eye was on the verge of vanishing into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had managed to hold out this long solely because of Devil Eye. But if that mystical sight faded, he knew he'd be no more than a helpless rabbit before the ravenous werewolves, stripped of any means to fend for itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolves would devour him in a single, merciless gulp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never imagined a boy, not even trained as a warrior, could hold us off for this damn long!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gotta admit, the power of a hero trying to save a damsel in distress is pretty damn impressive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too bad for you, though, you're still no match for us. The beauty you're trying to protect? She'll end up as our prey, too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three werewolves encircled Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With victory in their grasp, they slowed down, no longer in haste. They were like an old cat toying with a young mouse, eager to savor the thrill of the game before the final act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't even dream of it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony barely got one sentence out before the werewolf opposite him cut him off sharply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boy, why don't you take us to meet your little beauty, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He delivered a brutal punch straight to Anthony's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was launched like a cannonball, bursting through the door behind him and crashing into the house with a thunderous clatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dust swirled in his wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence fell, heavy and ominous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony lay still, seemingly lifeless. Inside, Rose and Helen were silent, petrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough delay. Kill the girl, and let's be done," one werewolf urged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've heard this girl's a real knockout, the finest beauty in all of Yoland. It'd be a damn shame to just kill her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the boss hadn't made it clear we gotta off her, we could've had our fun with her first. But hey, we can still enjoy her before we do the deed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, even if we can't touch the main prize, that little maid of hers ain't half bad. Let's grab her and have some fun together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three werewolves, with an air of casual cruelty, chatted amongst themselves as they strolled into the room with calmness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony lay amidst the dust and debris, his body still, looking for all the world as if he were dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were poised to step over his seemingly lifeless body, dismissing him as no longer a threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One werewolf was lured by the gleam of Dragonfang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This dagger's pretty sweet; it's mine now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He flashed a grim, predatory grin and leaned forward, reaching out to claim the dagger as his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Anthony, who had appeared lifeless, snapped his eyes open with a fierce glint!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had depleted every ounce of his energy and was gravely wounded; by all rights, he should have been on the brink of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, in that critical moment, his eyes shone like the edge of a blade, radiating a chilling, murderous intent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." The werewolf, bending over, only had time to utter a single word before he was cut off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a violent swing of his hand, Anthony wielded the sharp dagger, slicing it across the werewolf's throat in one swift motion, severing his head completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the head tumbled to the ground, blood erupted from the neck like a macabre fountain. Anthony, once prone on the ground, flipped over and sprang to his feet with eerie agility, launching himself at another werewolf.</span></p></div>
