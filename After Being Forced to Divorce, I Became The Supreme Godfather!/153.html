        <h1>Chapter 152 The Four Demon Lords</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After their intimate moment, Rose drifted off to a deep sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony slipped into a nightgown and quietly left the bedroom, heading straight for the secret chamber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Evil Spirit Legion's plans were still unclear, and as per Arthur's report, their informant's strength was not something to be underestimated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In three days, Anne and other family leaders were supposed to discuss something major.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given the involvement of the Evil Spirit Legion, it was unlikely to be anything good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time was of the essence. Anthony couldn't afford to waste any. His cultivation and </span><span>growth had become urgent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Energy-absorbing Breathing, given to him by the Dragon Ring, was powerful, though Anthony didn't fully understand its potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he did know was that his training speed was far beyond normal, and that was all thanks to the technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Yoland, the </span><span>Virstino</span><span> Mountains were an impenetrable natural barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stretching hundreds of miles from north to south and rising nearly 3,500 miles in altitude, it was home to endless valleys, cliffs, and ravines, teeming with dangerous creatures and venomous insects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ordinary people wouldn't dare venture in, and even those brave enough would only stay at the outskirts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nightfall came, and atop a mountain peak, a Black Cloak stood with his hands behind his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wind howled fiercely, lifting his robe and causing it to flap like a whip. The brim of his hood lifted briefly, revealing a pair of eyes glowing faintly red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the foot of the mountain, a figure quickly approached. He bowed slightly. "Your Excellency, it's an honor to meet you. I am Vincent Turner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lorcan </span><span>Iscairn</span><span> didn't turn around, his voice rough but commanding. "What is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anne and the other families will be heading to Wolf Fang Valley in three days..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Anthony is still alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent hesitated for a moment before continuing, "This man is a serious threat to the Evil Spirit Legion. He won't back down this time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The families are heading to Wolf Fang Valley, and Anthony will likely follow. I plan to take the opportunity to eliminate him once and for all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent's hatred for Anthony ran deep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for him, Rose would be dead, and Vincent would have become the head of the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, Anthony ruined his plans and forced him to leave the Turner family for this desolate place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Lorcan ignored him, clearly waiting for him to say more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent swallowed and continued, "However, my men are too weak to handle Anthony. He's too powerful for them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I beg you to take action personally and eliminate him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lorcan barely turned his head, his tone dripping with disdain. "He's just some pathetic drug user. You think he deserves my attention? How dare you even ask that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent flinched, panicking. "Please, don't be angry. I just don't want to miss this opportunity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony has too many connections in Yoland. Both the Turner family and the Dragon Guild are protecting him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't make a move there, but if he comes to the </span><span>Virstino</span><span> Mountains, that's different..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, Lorcan waved his hand, cutting him off. He spoke into the night. "The Four Demon Lords, step forward."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At your command," came the unified response, and four massive figures emerged from the darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent's eyes widened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four men were identical in every way, </span><span>the </span><span>same physique, </span><span>the </span><span>same features, and even the same ferocious gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wore black night clothing, the only difference being the colored sashes at their waists with green, red, black, and white.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Vincent was stunned, Lorcan spoke again. "These four are my most trusted and capable warriors."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Each one is a master in their own right, able to take on hundreds of opponents alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To ensure success, they will assist you in carrying out the plan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vincent, hear me well. This plan must succeed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you fail, you'll be the first to die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!" Vincent nodded eagerly, both terrified and thrilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rest assured. I'll do everything in my power. I won't let you down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go." Lorcan waved dismissively, and with a swirl of his cloak, he vanished into the night like a shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent breathed a sigh of relief, though the cold mountain wind sent a chill down his spine. His clothes were soaked with sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lorcan's presence was terrifying, and each encounter felt like a brush with death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, Vincent turned to face the Four Demon Lords.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their imposing stature and fierce presence made them seem unstoppable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He grinned. "Anthony, this time, there's no way you're getting away!"</span></p></div>
