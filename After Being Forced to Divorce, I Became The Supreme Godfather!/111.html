        <h1>Chapter 110 Atonement</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur's movements were swift, driven by his unwavering resolve to end his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony knocked the blade from his hand and said sharply, "You think you can just die and be done with it? After all the evil you've done, you think it's that easy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..." Arthur's face was streaked with tears. Gritting his teeth, he choked out, "I deserve to die. I've been complicit in atrocities. I've done unspeakable things. Kill me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He closed his eyes and exposed his neck to Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony let out a cold laugh. "You're so eager to die. But it's not going to be that simple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You remember everything you did under the soul contract, don't you? All the lives you destroyed, the families you ruined, the suffering you caused. And now you want to escape it all by dying? You think that'll make it right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's Devil Eye peered into Arthur's heart, revealing the truth. Arthur hadn't joined the Evil Spirit Legion willingly. He had been a victim of their cruelty&mdash;his entire family slaughtered, leaving him as the sole survivor. Driven by vengeance for his wife and children, he had tried to fight back, but his strength fell short. Instead, the Legion captured him, binding him with a soul contract and forcing him to serve as one of their pawns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since then, Arthur had committed countless atrocities under their control, and his guilt weighed heavily on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur collapsed to the ground, his voice low and filled with despair. "I know I deserve to die. I should burn in hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony... no, Mr. Johnson, do what you will. I ask only for death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's gaze didn't waver. "And that's exactly why I'm not letting you die so easily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Foster, what's happening?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Release Mr. Foster right now, or I'll kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voices came from nearby. A group of werewolves approached, dragging several Turner Guards as hostages. From the distance, they had heard Anthony's dragon-like roar and seen Mason collapse. Assuming their leader had been defeated, they intended to bargain for Arthur's release.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony barely spared them a glance. Killing them would be effortless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he was about to strike, Arthur spoke up, his lips trembling as though he were struggling to form the words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony turned to him. "What is it? Speak."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur hesitated before looking directly at Anthony. "Let them go. Release them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" one of the werewolves exclaimed in disbelief. "Mr. Foster, what are you saying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said let them go!" Arthur's voice thundered, his expression dark and commanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolves faltered but quickly obeyed. "Yes, Mr. Foster." They released the captives without further argument.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony raised an eyebrow. "Your soul contract is broken, yet you can still command them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur nodded. "Yes. While I'm no longer bound, they are still enslaved to the Evil Spirit Legion. I remain their leader."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glint appeared in Anthony's eyes, and a plan began to form. "Arthur," he said, his tone calm but deliberate. "Do you want to atone for your sins?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur stared blankly. "Atone? How could I? I've killed so many people, committed so many horrors. How can I ever make amends?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony cut him off. "I can give you a chance&mdash;a chance to right some of your </span><span>wrongs and avenge your wife and daughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur's eyes narrowed, skepticism creeping into his expression. "You? Give me a chance? Just because you defeated me, you think you can make empty promises?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My wife and daughter were murdered by the Evil Spirit Legion. Do you even understand what it would take to avenge them? Who do you think you are, making claims like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Arthur could finish, Anthony slapped him hard across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First," Anthony said, his voice cold and sharp, "you will address me with respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Second, I said I would give you a chance, and I meant it. Whether you take it or not is up to you, but don't forget&mdash;I could kill you right now if I wanted to. Giving you this opportunity is more mercy than you deserve. Disrespect me again, and I won't hesitate to end you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's piercing gaze cut through Arthur, his fury palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur froze, his body trembling. For the first time, he realized this young man was no ordinary individual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he reflected on the battle, he recalled Anthony's overwhelming combat abilities&mdash;far beyond what anyone had expected. Even level-B metahumans had been no match for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, Anthony had freed Arthur from his soul's enslavement, a feat Arthur hadn't thought possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear now: Anthony was no ordinary man.</span></p></div>
