        <h1>Chapter 80 The Time</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the guards muttered, "What's going on? Why did they stop?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another added, "Yeah, what are those werewolves doing? Why aren't they attacking?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards at the east gate exchanged confused glances. The werewolves had broken through the Turner Manor's gate with ease, their strength and numbers overwhelming. Yet now, they had come to a halt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the banquet hall, the confusion mirrored that of the guards outside. Hundreds of werewolves had stormed the manor, and everyone thought the Turner family was doomed. But instead of rushing in, they stopped just outside the gates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family's guards stood frozen, terror evident on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they all rushed at us at once, at least we could fight to the death," one whispered. </span><span>"But what's with this waiting? Are they toying with us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the strongest of the Turner family, Carolyn, looked tense. If the werewolves continued their siege, she wouldn't last long against their claws. The fear was palpable, and everyone believed the end was near.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the hall, Anne laughed mockingly. "Rose, are you really ready to die for a bastard like him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you honestly think you can stop hundreds of werewolves? What a joke."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin joined in, smirking. "Anthony, no one can save you this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're nothing but a pathetic coward. It's laughable that the Turner family treated someone like you as a distinguished guest&mdash;let alone their so-called savior. Hilarious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Rose, he sneered, "Did you know, Rose? Anthony admitted he's just a failed experiment from the Dragon Group. And now, the Turner family is going to perish for him? A mere test subject? It's absolutely ridiculous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Anne and Alvin laughed loudly, their derision cutting through the tense atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose turned pale and clutched Anthony's arm. Her eyes filled with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two are despicable," Anthony said, his voice calm but cold as he stepped forward. "I've never relied on anyone to protect me, and I'm not about to start now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne scoffed, folding her arms. "Oh, really? So bold, so brave. Then why are you hiding here, letting a woman protect you? You're just a coward pretending to be tough. It's pathetic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin chimed in, "If you're so courageous, Anthony, go outside and die like a man. Stop hiding behind others and talking big."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's expression didn't change. "I will go out," he said calmly. "But not to atone or prove anything. The time has come."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne rolled her eyes and laughed mockingly. "The time has come? What nonsense! You're just a failed experiment, and you're sitting here talking like you're someone important. It's ridiculous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Anne could continue, the werewolves outside split into two lines, and a towering figure strode forward. It was Mason, his commanding presence undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He howled, his voice echoing across the manor. "Anthony! Rose! You have ten minutes to come out and face your deaths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, we'll storm this manor and slaughter every last member of the Turner family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolves raised their heads and howled in unison. The sound was deafening, a terrifying chorus that sent chills down everyone's spines&mdash;even those safely inside the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose clung to Anthony's arm, her voice trembling. "Anthony..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry," Anthony said softly, turning to her. "I've been waiting for him. Now that Mason is here, it's time for me to act."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you..." Rose's voice faltered. She grabbed his arm tighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony didn't wait for her to finish. He turned to the Turner guards. "Escort Ms. Turner to the safe house. Protect her at all costs, and don't leave her side for a </span><span>second."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Johnson!" The guards saluted and moved to take Rose away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" Rose cried, her voice firm. "I'm not going anywhere. Anthony, you're a guest of the Turner family, and you're going out to fight. How can I, the heir, stay hidden?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, the werewolves demanded that we both go out. If I don't, they'll attack with everything they have."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony hesitated, her words weighing on him. He knew the guards were risking their lives not only to protect him but to protect Rose, the future of the Turner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne sneered from across the room. "Look at this. You two lovebirds are about to die, and you're still putting on this show of affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's next? Should I arrange a room so you can enjoy your last moments together? You're disgusting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony ignored her. He took a deep breath, steadying himself for what was to come. "Rose," he said firmly, "if you insist on coming with me, stay close. I will protect you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose nodded resolutely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's mocking laugh rang out again. "You two are unbelievable. Pretending to be heroes when you're just walking to your deaths. Hilarious."</span></p></div>
