        <h1>Chapter 122 Aaron Hastings</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony looked at him and couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was this guy jealous that he bestowed names upon others?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anthony said nothing, thinking for a moment before speaking. "If you don't like the name Arthur Hastings, you can always go by 'Aaron Hastings' from now on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aaron Hastings?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur murmured the name, and then his face lit up with delight. He bowed, saying, "Thank you for the name, Mr. Johnson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Arthur, come with me. The rest of you stay here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting any time, Anthony led Arthur, or rather, Aaron, into the Celestial Palace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they entered, Seraph greeted them with a smile. "Congratulations, Mr. Johnson, for successfully completing the second phase of the Chosen Path."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words were serious, but Anthony couldn't shake the feeling that Seraph's gaze carried an odd, almost seductive allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was hard to deny&mdash;whenever he saw Seraph, she always made his heart skip a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her wavy golden hair cascaded like a waterfall, soft and voluminous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her golden V-neck gown clung to her curves, accentuating her graceful figure in the most alluring way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her every movement radiated a unique, fiery sensuality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony smiled, though his thoughts were far from romantic. He knew Seraph was a rose with thorns&mdash;beautiful, yes, but not someone he could easily get close to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To truly win her over, one would first have to remove her thorns&mdash;but Anthony wasn't in any position to do so yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Anthony was unphased, Seraph leaned in closer, her voice dropping to a whisper. "The second-phase task is complete, and your reward is upgraded..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now intrigued, Anthony asked, "What reward?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, it's me...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, this time you can really enjoy me anytime..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gave him a teasing smile, flipping her golden hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's lips twitched, and he shot her an irritated glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to his surprise, there was no warning from the Devil Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did this mean she was telling the truth?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could the reward truly be... her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't in the mood for such things at the moment. Calmly, he walked past Seraph and entered the main hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Anthony remained composed, Arthur, following behind, couldn't help but gawk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was too beautiful, too alluring!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This fiery, seductive blonde woman called him... Mr. Johnson?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing Arthur's disarray, Anthony wasn't surprised. It was hard for any man to resist the charm of a woman like her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph giggled, turning to Anthony. "Mr. Johnson, when you first arrived here, you were just as stunned as he is now..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahem."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony cleared his throat to mask his embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur quickly snapped back to his senses, his face reddening in awkwardness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To ease the situation, he pulled a map from his pocket and handed it to Anthony. "Mr. Johnson, here's the map you asked me to prepare."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the battle at the Phantom Hollow, Arthur informed Anthony that they had been hiding in the Virstino Mountains prior to that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This information had also been confirmed by the werewolves they had captured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Additionally, a base for the Evil Spirit Legion was located within the Virstino Mountains, known as the Southwest Camp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur wasn't sure how many werewolf assassins were stationed there, as they tended to operate in smaller, scattered groups.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They rarely gathered together, and the communication between them was limited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Virstino Mountains were just over a hundred miles from the Turner family Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Evil Spirit Legion's presence there was a major threat to Yoland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now that the attempt to attack the Turner family had failed, the Evil Spirit Legion would certainly not rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whatever their motives, they were sure to strike again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furthermore, Arthur was the grandson of the Godfather and the future heir of the Godfather Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Evil Spirit Legion was the number one enemy of the Godfather Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, even though he wasn't actively planning an attack, Arthur knew he had to remain vigilant and gather intel on the Evil Spirit Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing his enemy was key to winning any battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony briefly looked over the map before passing it to Seraph. "Send someone to investigate the Virstino Mountains. If you find any leads, report back to me immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Make sure to operate in secret. We don't want to alert them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For now, Anthony didn't have the strength to confront the Evil Spirit Legion head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, he was the Godfather's grandson, but as the Godfather had told him, he wouldn't receive much help until he completed the Chosen Path and the Dragon Ring task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So far, only Seraph and Jane were by his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was why he had gathered loyal followers like Arthur. Draconic Shield was his true source of strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also knew the Godfather's test for him wasn't just about completing the Dragon Ring's mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Along the way, he needed to demonstrate enough power to show he was worthy of being the next leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this power wasn't limited to just his physical strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Johnson," Seraph replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Anthony's serious expression, she put aside her playful attitude and thought for a moment before asking, "What about the others? Do you have any plans for them?"</span></p></div>
