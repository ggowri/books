        <h1>Chapter 91 Bloodthirsty Light</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You despicable bastard! I'll tear you apart!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Anthony was secretly regretting, a thunderous roar echoed in his ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the stimulation of fresh blood, Mason completely lost control, his pair of emerald green eyes emitting a bloodthirsty glow!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Mason rampaged, causing the earth to tremble and dust to rise everywhere!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His already exceptionally tall and robust figure grew even larger, with his broad black robe barely able to contain his massive form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony wailed inwardly, "I'm doomed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all this time fighting, it turned out that Mason hadn't even used his full strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A loud howl triggered a terrifying force that swept through the surrounding space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A pitch-black wolf's claw extended from beneath the black robe, and in an instant, it was less than three feet away from Anthony!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was shocked to his core, desperately unleashing the full power of the Leopard Avatar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his blood vessels dilated, Anthony couldn't help but let out a roar to the sky, like a thunderclap!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony gained a frenzied strength, causing the stone slabs beneath his feet to shatter into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason approached, and Anthony sidestepped swiftly. Then, a fist filled with astonishing power slammed towards Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The astounding roar made even the enraged Mason startle, casting a surprised glance at Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he didn't stop rushing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thick wolf's claw, hidden by the black robe, fiercely swiped towards Anthony!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony focused intently on Mason, then raised his hand to meet the attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed was incredibly fast, like thunder!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used Thunder Claw!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After achieving great success in his cultivation, he could use the power of thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the current Anthony couldn't yet summon thunder, but the power he wielded now was still formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kid, what kind of power is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his powerful strike, Mason was taken aback and, with a loud shout, decided to change his move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He flipped his wrist and, with sharp claws, suddenly reached down as if to grab Anthony's wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After focusing all his attention, Anthony's reaction speed became incredibly fast, and he changed his move to grab for Mason's elbow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Anthony's move changed so quickly that Mason cursed in anger and reluctantly withdrew his attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he lifted his foot and kicked fiercely towards Anthony's stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fully focused, Anthony immediately raised his foot to counter and, taking advantage of the situation, delivered an elbow strike towards Mason's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason bent down and lunged at Anthony's unguarded armpit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of their attacks were fierce, yet they managed to defend against each other's strikes, making the fight intensely close for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's attacks were varied and continuous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of this came from Jane's technique crystal, which is why he not only had many moves but was also extremely powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the gates of Turner Manor, figures darted about, and the dull sounds of collisions continued one after another, as if an earthquake were occurring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dust rose in torrents, making the scene resemble the end of the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power unleashed by the two seemed to want to destroy everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The immense power made Rose, who was not far away, feel an unprecedented shock. She had never imagined that Anthony's combat strength would be so terrifying, nor had she ever thought that his growth rate would be so fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Anthony had possessed his current combat strength last time, he would certainly not have been in such a predicament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a pity that no one could predict the future. The Mason that Anthony faced now was also incredibly powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle between the two was completely beyond the imagination of ordinary people. The fierce aura they emitted was daunting to behold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far away, Anne, Alvin, and their followers stared at the swirling dust with their mouths wide open in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The formidable Anthony appeared like a devil in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, Anthony seemed certain to die, but now he had become so powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His combat strength now was truly inconceivable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they had no idea that from the beginning, Anthony planned to use the pretense of weakness to deceive his opponents, prolong the fight, buy time, and wait for Carolyn's support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to Mason, Carolyn was now in a desperate situation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this case, Anthony has no choice but to go all out in this battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle, which seemed overwhelmingly powerful, was also depleting Anthony's strength at an alarming rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To the onlookers, the two seemed evenly matched, however, in reality, Anthony's strength was far inferior to Mason's!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The light of the Devil Eye gradually dimmed, and the power of the Leopard Avatar seemed to be waning as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner, the south gate has been breached, and the werewolves are rushing in..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While everyone was intensely focused and trembling with fear watching the battle between Anthony and the other, a guard covered in blood stumbled over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Rose exclaimed in shock, "The south gate has been breached?! What about Dariel? How is Dariel now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel, as the captain of Turner Guards, was a Level A metahuman and a loyal protector of the Turner family, willing to risk his life for their safety!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the werewolves had already breached the south gate, then Dariel probably sacrificed himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony! Can you hear that?" Rose cried out in anguish, while Anne threw back her head and laughed maniacally, exclaiming, "The south gate has been breached, Dariel is dead, and the werewolves have stormed into the Turner Manor... Today, you will die. All of you will die! From now on, the Turner family will cease to exist!"</span></p></div>
