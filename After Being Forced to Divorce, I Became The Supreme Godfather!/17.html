        <h1>Chapter 17 Meeting Mr. Johnson</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A soft voice floated in from a distance. A woman, noble and charismatic, walked towards them with an aura of unspoken authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was Jane Ronald, the Director of Dragon Guild. Though only thirty years old, she held this position due to her extraordinary abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rarely appeared in public, but there was no doubt that she was one of the most powerful figures in all of Yoland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her beauty had earned her the status of a goddess in the hearts of many.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel quickly bent his waist in greeting. "Ms. Ronald, hello!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dragon Guards dropped to one knee, all calling out in unison, "We greet you, Ms. Ronald!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the wealthy and influential figures at the entrance bowed their heads in respect, "We greet you, Ms. Ronald!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin pulled Anne beside him, his voice trembling with excitement. "Ms. Ronald, my name is Alvin Blake, heir to the Blake family and a silver-tier member of Dragon Guild. I've always admired you deeply!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne quickly added, "I'm Anne Smith, heir to the Smith family, and Alvin's fianc&eacute;e! Ms. Ronald, you are so noble and so beautiful, truly a model for all woman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane gave a simple nod, then turned to Daniel. "Don't you know the rules of Dragon Guild? We prohibit disturbances on trading days. Why are you causing a scene?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel hurriedly explained, "Ms. Ronald! This man, Anthony, is the troublemaker! He claims that even if he's not a member, he can enter our guild!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He even said that you would come out to greet him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so?" Jane asked coldly, her gaze fixing on Anthony. "How dare he say that? Unless he is..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she looked up at Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw the Dragon Ring sparkling in his hand, her mouth fell open in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel, mistaking her astonishment for anger, quickly added, "Ms. Ronald, please, don't be upset! I'll handle this immediately! Protecting your dignity is also protecting </span><span>Dragon Guild's dignity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he gathered his strength and strode towards Anthony, fully prepared to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, he had underestimated Anthony and been knocked back. Now, he was ready to use his Warrior power for a decisive blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him! Protect Ms. Ronald's honor!" the crowd shouted excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin was particularly eager. He had planned to pay for a kill order on Anthony today, but now, it seemed that Anthony had brought this on himself. Alvin would save the money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne, gazing at Anthony's handsome face, felt sorry for him. Yet, she couldn't help but think that Anthony deserved this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She believed it was a good thing for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, if he died at Daniel's hands, then there would be no one to stand in the way of her marriage to Alvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Daniel reached Anthony, preparing to strike, Jane suddenly shouted, her voice ringing with authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel turned in confusion. "Ms. Ronald, is there anything you need?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a stern expression, Jane walked briskly up to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel, almost shaking with excitement, asked, "Ms. Ronald, do you want to deal with him yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd buzzed with anticipation. "I've heard that Ms. Ronald is a superpower Metahuman. Looks like we're about to witness something extraordinary!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Anthony dies by Ms. Ronald's hand, he should feel honored!" people murmured excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone believed that Jane, furious, was about to end Anthony's life personally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They widened their eyes, waiting to see her unleash her powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Jane walked up to Daniel and, with a sharp slap, sent him sprawling to the ground. "Offending Mr. Johnson is a crime deserving of death! From now on, you're dismissed!" she declared coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel, clutching his face in shock, could hardly believe his ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words were a thunderclap to everyone in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Jane did next left them all in absolute shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a graceful motion, Jane said respectfully, "I'm Jane Ronald, the leader of the Dragon Guild's Yoland Branch. It's my honor to meet you, Mr. Johnson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was truly bowing to the man!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was addressing Anthony, this so-called worthless man, as Mr. Johnson!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's eyes widened in disbelief, and she stared at Anthony, stunned. "Wait, are you really the Godfather's grandson?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her words, Jane's eyes suddenly lit up. Her gaze softened as she studied Anthony with an intensity that revealed both admiration and intrigue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She recognized the Dragon Ring on his finger. It was a token only those closest to the </span><span>Godfather were allowed to wear. Those who wore it were always at the very top of the Godfather Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane, as the Director of Dragon Guild's Yoland branch, was far beneath such people in status. But still, she wasn't sure exactly what relationship Anthony had with the Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's words sparked a realization in her that made her heart race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Anthony is the Godfather's grandson!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He is likely to be the next Supreme Godfather!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I could win his favor, I might one day be promoted."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excitedly, Jane stood, her voice full of respect. "I had no idea you would honor us with your presence, Mr. Johnson. Please forgive my inadequate welcome! Mr. Johnson, please, come inside. Please be my guest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony gave a small nod. "Thank you, Ms. Ronald. I appreciate it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he walked confidently into the guild, his steps steady and deliberate, all eyes on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane quickly stood and followed him, almost like a servant, respectfully trailing behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dragon Guards on either side of the gates and those scattered around the courtyard all dropped to one knee and shouted, "Welcome, Mr. Johnson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deafening sound echoed through the area, leaving Daniel, Alvin, Anne, and all the wealthy and powerful figures frozen in place, speechless.</span></p></div>
