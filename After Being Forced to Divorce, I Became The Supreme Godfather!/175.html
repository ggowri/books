        <h1>Chapter 174 Prisoners in Chains</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family's elders were at each other's throats, arguing so loudly it felt like stepping into a marketplace where everyone was shouting and cursing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chaotic scene caught Anthony off guard for a moment. This didn't seem like the Elder Council of a prominent family. But he didn't bother dwelling on it too much. Instead, as the arguments raged on, he quietly observed and took mental notes of each elder's stance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless of their opinions, Anthony didn't feel much about them. In this situation, there was no clear right or wrong&mdash;every choice had its own risks and consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the noise finally started dying down, Anthony slammed his hand on the table and stood up. "Enough! Quiet down. All of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden action startled the elders, and they promptly shut their mouths. The large council chamber then fell into an eerie silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony spoke, his voice calm but commanding, "Everyone, </span><span>we aren</span><span>'</span><span>t here </span><span>to</span><span> argu</span><span>e</span><span>." He paused for a moment and </span><span>then </span><span>continu</span><span>ed</span><span>, "Ms. Carolyn Turner and Ms. Turner are in grave danger now. We don't have time for this bullshit. Listen up - I'll make this quick, then you do whatever you want</span><span>.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First of all, Ms. Carolyn Turner and Ms. Turner</span><span> are still alive</span><span>. Vincent needs their acknowledgment. He's after a false sense of legitimacy. Otherwise, he wouldn't have allowed you all to go to the Mines."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Second, I will find a way to rescue </span><span>them.</span><span> But I need all of you guys' cooperation. You must go to the Mines as planned. Not to side with Vincent, but to buy me some time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elders didn't respond immediately. They sat in silence, weighing Anthony's words carefully while contemplating their next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Vincent and his entourage returned to the Turner family's Mines in a grand procession. The convoy drove through an open expanse before reaching a cluster of buildings. There were rows of makeshift shacks alongside a handful of small brick houses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the pale, white sky, armed guards patrolled the area with submachine guns. After passing the shacks, the convoy reached a group of three-story buildings, their windows glowing brightly in the dim surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they drove past the lit buildings, the convoy thinned out, leaving just three vehicles heading toward a distant valley. The further they drove, the darker the light grew, with the surrounding trees becoming denser and more oppressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beyond the shadowed valley was a pitch-black cave. Inside the cave was a hidden chamber. Originally constructed as a secure bunker to deal with emergencies, it was designed to be easy to defend and hard to breach, with only one entrance and exit through the valley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent had repurposed that chamber into a dungeon. It now housed the Mines' </span><span>previous administrators and anyone who dared to defy his authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Vincent stepped into the chamber, an onslaught of angry, ear-piercing curses erupted from within. He scoffed, "Lock them up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He ignored the noise entirely. At his order, several men in black shoved Carolyn and Rose into the dungeon without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the other prisoners in the dungeon finally noticed that it was Rose and Carolyn. They gasped in shock, "Ms. Carolyn Turner? Ms. Turner?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose turned her head, scanning the prisoners. Each of them was covered in blood, battered, and utterly miserable. These were the heads of the Mines and people who had once been fiercely loyal to the Turner family. And now, they had been reduced to prisoners in chains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fury burned in her chest as she glared at Vincent and shouted, "You're completely insane! Aren't you afraid of karma, Vincent?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent's expression remained cold, and he sneered arrogantly, "Save it. Once I have complete control over the Turner family, I'll make sure to send you all to hell. What a pity, though&mdash;I couldn't kill that bastard Anthony with my own hands. That's my only regret."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose spat on the ground and snapped back, "Keep dreaming, Vincent! Anthony is too clever for you. He'll get out of this alive. I'm sure of it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent let out a mocking laugh, his tone dripping with disdain. "You're so fucking naive, Rose. Absolutely foolish. Anthony is just a pretty boy. </span><span>You</span><span> think he's with you because he loves you? Don't kid yourself&mdash;it's all about the power and status of the Turner family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>But you are just</span><span> a pathetic prisoner</span><span> now</span><span>. Why would he even bother coming to save you? Let me make one thing clear&mdash;this time, Anthony is as good as dead. Even if, by some miracle, he survives, what then? </span><span>H</span><span>e has the guts to storm the Mines and rescue you? Dream on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Vincent was speaking, a man hurried into the room, his face pale with panic. "Mr. Vincent Turner, Lord </span><span>Necros</span><span> has returned..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?" Vincent froze for a moment and then his face lit up with excitement. "Lord </span><span>Necros</span><span> is back? </span><span>So</span><span> Anthony </span><span>is </span><span>dead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man hesitated, visibly uneasy. "Well... Lord </span><span>Necros</span><span>, uh... he was injured. And Anthony... Anthony is still alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent's eyes went wide at the words. "Huh? What did you just say?" he </span><span>exclaim</span><span>ed, his tone heavy with shock. "Anthony is alive and Lord </span><span>Necros</span><span> is injured? How's that even possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose and Carolyn were momentarily stunned, struggling to process the exchange. But Vincent's reaction gave them clarity</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>A</span><span> spark of joy flickered on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's alive. Anthony is alive," Rose whispered, her voice trembling with relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a </span><span>while</span><span>, she couldn't contain her excitement and declared, "Anthony is a brilliant strategist and a fearless warrior. Your schemes were doomed from the start. As long as Anthony is alive, you'll never gain control of the Turner family, Vincent!"</span></p></div>
