        <h1>Chapter 9 Uncovering the truth</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guests at the event quickly pieced together what was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumors had been circulating that Anne was a business genius and that every project she touched turned into a huge success in record time. They believed that working with her would bring in even more profits, which was why they had all been so eager to support her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, they realized it was all a lie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne had only succeeded by cheating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, her flawless image crumbled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd buzzed with whispers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of Thomas' supporters began to speak up, demanding that Anne relinquish her position as the heir and submit to a family investigation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas should be the rightful heir to the Smith family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's heart raced. She hadn't expected Anthony to have the guts to expose her in front of so many people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do we do now, Alvin?" she asked, gripping his arm in a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, shut up!" Alvin bellowed, and the room fell silent at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled her close, sneering. "So what if it's all fake? Let me make this clear. Anne is my fianc&eacute;e, and with the full backing of the Blake family, no one dares to oppose her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne, her confidence surging, added, "That's right! I have the Blake family's support, and I can bring huge fame and profit to the Smith family! With that alone, I'm more than qualified to be the heir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several of the Smith family elders nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guests, now understanding, started to shift their perspective.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Smith family might only be a new player with billions in assets, but the Blake family was a longstanding power with tens of billions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the heir to the Blake family, Alvin's support meant no one would dare challenge Anne's position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the elders of the Smith family spoke up gravely. "Anne is the rightful heir. That's unquestionable! Thomas, you'd better start supporting your cousin and stop making trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the family's pressure weighing on him, Thomas had no choice but to begrudgingly agree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What had started as a crisis for Anne was effortlessly defused by a single sentence from Alvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere shifted as the room filled with flattery and praise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne stood tall, radiating confidence. She glared at Anthony, her teeth clenched. "You couldn't have me, so now you want to ruin me. Anthony, I get it, but you're just too na&iuml;ve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your little tricks are nothing compared to my fianc&eacute;!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now do you see the difference? Compared to Alvin, he's a god. You're just a pitiful </span><span>ant in a stinky gutter!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin, clearly enjoying himself, looked at Anthony with disdain. "Did you hear that, Anthony? Trying to mess with my wedding with Anne? That's pure fantasy. If you've got anything else up your sleeve, go ahead and try it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm giving you this chance, though, so don't say I didn't warn you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin's poise and charm instantly won over many of the young women in the room. They gazed at him in awe, utterly captivated by his presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't help but envy Anne for being engaged to him. Meanwhile, Anthony looked like nothing more than a clueless country bumpkin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Blake is so handsome!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, why don't you beg Mr. Blake for forgiveness?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just a leech, living off others. What could you possibly compare to Mr. Blake?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their mocking words stung.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony showed a cold smile. "Since you all think so highly of him, let me show you just what your Prince Charming really looks like."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Prepare yourselves for the second surprise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The image on the big screen shifted, and then, suddenly, a man's moan echoed through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, Bruce, you're incredible! Harder!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A stunned silence swept over the crowd as everyone turned to look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the hotel's king-sized bed, Alvin was completely naked, with a blonde man lying on top of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the blonde man thrust harder, Alvin matched his movements, moaning in pleasure with every motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The video brutally exposed Alvin's secret. He was gay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room immediately erupted in chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The women who had once admired him were now covering their eyes in shock. Some even ran to the trash can, vomiting in disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne, the victim in all of this, was utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This isn't real!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where did this footage come from? Turn it off! Now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin shouted desperately, but it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd stared at him with the same horror and fascination one would reserve for a monster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's cold smile widened. "As soon as I saw how close you were to Anne, I dug into your past. All of this came from your computer. I thought you were just a gay man who wouldn't touch her. But to cover up your own truth, you planned to marry her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anne, now you see it, don't you? You were never more than a shield to hide his secret."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's face flushed with anger, her teeth clenched. "Even if that's true, he's still better than you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin seized the moment to fire back, his voice sharp. "Right! Anthony, you've never </span><span>been able to rise to the occasion! At least I'm a real man, unlike you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd snickered again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what Alvin's sexual orientation was, he was still a man, while Anthony wasn't even that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just jealous!" Alvin sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For any man, there was no greater insult than that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony only gave a mysterious smile. "The third gift, pay attention, both of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a hidden button in his palm, he pressed it, and the screen went black. The next second, the room was filled with the excited, high-pitched voices of a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, Anthony. That's so big!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of nowhere, the screen was completely overtaken by the image of a naked woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her breasts were squeezed in front of the camera, sending a jolt of excitement through the room.</span></p></div>
