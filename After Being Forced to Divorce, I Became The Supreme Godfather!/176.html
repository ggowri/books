        <h1>Chapter 175 A Trap</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent, seething with anger, scowled and said, "Hmph! </span><span>So</span><span> what if he's alive? If he </span><span>dares to show up, I'll make sure he leave</span><span>s</span><span> in piece</span><span>s</span><span>." With that, he stormed out of the dungeon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he walked briskly, he pondered, "Anthony's alive and Lord </span><span>Necros</span><span> got hurt? That's </span><span>news</span><span>. </span><span>Archlord</span><span> </span><span>Iscairn</span><span> always said the Four Demon Lords were unstoppable, each one skilled enough to take on an army single-handedly."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony is just a useless pretty boy. How could he possibly stand a chance against Lord </span><span>Necros</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent blurted out loud, "What happened, Lord </span><span>Necros</span><span>? Anthony is just a useless nobody. How could he possibly&mdash;" As he hurried into the bright</span><span> </span><span>hall, the sight of </span><span>Necros</span><span> covered in blood and looking utterly battered stopped him in his tracks.</span><span> </span><span>His voice faltered, and his words died away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could Anthony really be that strong? Or... is Lord </span><span>Necros</span><span> weaker than I thought? No, that can't be right," Vincent wondered, his mind spinning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Archlord</span><span> </span><span>Iscairn</span><span> clearly told me that the Four Demon Lords are unmatched, peerless warriors. </span><span>Necros</span><span> going after Anthony should've been a walk in the park, a simple errand. But now&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Vincent could fully process his thoughts, Mordred slapped him across the face with a loud smack and barked, "You've got the nerve to talk like that, you moron! You keep calling him a useless fool, a pretty boy, but you never say a word about how powerful he really is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slap landed hard, leaving Vincent wincing in pain, his face twisted, and his eyes momentarily seeing stars. Shaking, he muttered, "L-Lord Mordred, what's the meaning of this? From what I know, Anthony is nothing but a weakling... Even if he has some strength, it's only because of those experimental drugs from the Godfather Research Institute. How strong could he really be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't know a damn thing!" Mordred </span><span>snapped,</span><span> his tone sharp with irritation. He glared at Vincent and then added grimly, "What's truly terrifying here is the Godfather Research Institute. That brat must be hiding something, something big."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if it's just the drugs, they're no ordinary drugs. If that's the case, we can't just take him out without thinking it through..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mordred turned to look at his three brothers. The four of them exchanged glances, and as if they shared a single thought, the same sly, cold smile crept across their faces. Seeing this, Vincent swallowed nervously, his palms growing clammy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long moment of silent agreement, Astaroth was the first to nod. "I think it's doable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm on board," Malakar added with a nod of his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Necros</span><span>, however, remained grim-faced, his voice icy as he declared, "One way or another, I'll kill him myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent hesitated before cautiously asking, "L-Lords, what's the plan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to Yoland and capture Anthony," the Four Demon Lords responded in perfect unison, their timing eerily synchronized, as if one voice spoke for all of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent was startled and spoke up, "Huh? Go to Yoland? My Lords, I don't think there's any reason to go to Yoland. I've already notified the Turner family about hosting the succession ceremony in the Mines. I've also invited the Turner family's Elder Council and representatives from the Yoland families to attend the ceremony."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Anthony is still alive, he'll definitely show up to save Rose once he hears the news. Why don't we set up an ambush ahead of time and wait for him to walk right into the trap?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent wasn't stupid. The Four Demon Lords were his biggest support, especially </span><span>with the succession ceremony approaching. The last thing he wanted was for them to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, the Mines was nothing like Yoland. The Mines had been carefully transformed into Vincent's stronghold, where everything was under his control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yoland, however, was a different story. It was home to the Dragon Guild, members of the Dragon Group, and various other forces tangled in a complex web of alliances. More importantly, the Evil Spirit Legion had a notorious reputation. Vincent knew that if they made a move in Yoland, it would inevitably attract attention from other powers, which could spell trouble. As the saying goes, "Better safe than sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the Four Demon Lords were considering the situation, Sergio burst into the room with excitement and announced, "Mr. Vincent Turner, the Elder Council has agreed. However, they said they won't make it today. They'll arrive by noon tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent's face lit up with joy as he exclaimed, "Very well! At least those old fossils know when to adapt." As he laughed, he asked, "Oh, by the way, Anthony is still alive. Did you happen to see him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sergio's expression immediately shifted, and he blurted out in shock, "What? Anthony is still alive? How is that possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sergio was well aware that Anthony had gone to the </span><span>Virstino</span><span> Mountains. That was why Vincent could pinpoint Anthony's whereabouts, allowing </span><span>Necros</span><span> to track him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Sergio knew that the people sent this time were Lorcan's subordinates&mdash;exceptionally powerful individuals. Sergio was convinced that Anthony couldn't have survived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Vincent could respond, </span><span>Necros</span><span> spoke up angrily, "Hmph. That brat is seriously injured. There's no way he can return to Yoland so quickly. Even if he manages to crawl back, he'll need at least a few weeks to recover."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Necros</span><span> was confident about this. Sure, Anthony wasn't dead, but their battle had left neither of them with the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vincent's eyes gleamed with excitement as he shouted, "Perfect! Whether he wants to or not, he'll show up tomorrow. We'll strike while he's weak and finish him off. Then, I'll have his head displayed as a warning to all who dare stand against me."</span></p></div>
