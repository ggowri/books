        <h1>Chapter 169 The Most Fatal Blow</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's strike missed, and she slammed hard against the cliffside. The impact left Rose cradled in her arms, dazed and dizzy. Everything had happened too fast for her to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Carolyn!" Rose finally cried out in alarm as they hit the ground. She held Carolyn tightly, frantically channeling the healing power within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent burst into laughter, his voice brimming with arrogance. "</span><span>O</span><span>h</span><span>, my.</span><span> Carolyn, even the people you trust the most are working for me</span><span> now</span><span>. What do you have left to fight me with?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why..." Carolyn's voice trembled as she lifted her head. She didn't spare Vincent a glance, instead turning her devastated gaze to Sergio.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent wasn't lying&mdash;Sergio was indeed one of the people she trusted most. And yet, at the most critical moment, he had dealt her the most fatal blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sergio's attack wasn't enough to kill Carolyn outright, but Malakar's sword strike was something she couldn't withstand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As an elemental Metahuman, Carolyn possessed immense elemental power and incredible combat abilities. But the weaknesses of elemental Metahumans were just as glaring&mdash;they were poor at close combat and had fragile defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Malakar hadn't been injured, that sword strike would have almost certainly killed her on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Sergio could explain himself, Vincent waved a commanding hand. "Seize them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family's elite guards marched forward with heavy steps. Among them were several who had previously escorted Carolyn and her group to Mines. The rest of the guards had already fallen, their bodies lying lifeless in pools of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Rose saw the grim situation, her eyes turned icy, and she instinctively clenched her fists. The last time the Turner family faced off, she and Anthony had combined their powers, enabling her to break through her limits and awaken water-elemental power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since then, she had focused intently on training and refining her skills. With Anthony's guidance and their dual cultivation technique, she now possessed a fair amount of combat prowess. However, before she could act, Carolyn discreetly tugged her arm, signaling her to stay put.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose's strength might suffice against an average Metahuman or Warrior, but Malakar was in a league of his own. Even injured, he was far beyond her abilities. Not to mention, Sergio and dozens of black-clad fighters stood nearby, watching them like hawks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose's frustration boiled over, and she snapped, "You'd better think twice before doing anything stupid, Vincent! Anthony won't let you off&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony?" Vincent threw his head back and laughed uproariously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was mocking as he sneered, "That worthless piece of trash? Only blind fools like you would see him as the Turner family's last hope. Let me </span><span>tell</span><span> you</span><span> something</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>he</span><span>'s up against someone as powerful as Lord Malakar. Do you really think he stands a chance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as those words left his mouth, Rose froze in fear, and Carolyn's expression shifted drastically. She wondered, "Did he make a move on Anthon</span><span>y as well</span><span>? And... he used someone as strong as Malakar to do it? If that's the case, doesn't that mean Anthony is as good as dead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn knew all too well how powerful Malakar was. While she appeared calm and composed in the fight, it was important to remember that she was a Level C elemental Metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, on the other hand, was only a Level B Metahuman at best. The gap between their abilities wasn't just a small difference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To make things worse, Malakar specialized in close combat. Carolyn had been able to hold her ground against him only because her abilities relied on long-range attacks. She had deliberately kept her distance, denying him any chance to get close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anthony? He fought best in close quarters. Against Malakar, who could transform into a towering beast hundreds of feet tall, how could he even hope to engage in melee combat? That monstrous form was practically invincible in a brawl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent smiled faintly and said with a calm yet sharp voice, "Alright, stop putting your hopes on that loser Anthony. At this point, there's only one person who can save the Turner family&mdash;and that's me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Carolyn, if you submit to me now, it's not too late. Pledge your loyalty, and I'll elevate the Turner family to new heights. I won't treat you unfairly. So, what do you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gazed down at Carolyn, his posture exuding arrogance and satisfaction. For him, this was a moment of triumph&mdash;he was thoroughly enjoying himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's anger boiled over, and she snapped, "Spit on that! You're delusional, Vincent! Someone as ruthless and despicable as you will never control the Turner family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And do you </span><span>really</span><span> think the Evil Spirit Legion would genuinely support you? Wake up! They're a group of vile criminals with sins too numerous to count. Everyone wants to see them wiped out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yet you're collaborating with them and dreaming of taking the Turner family to new heights? What a joke!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent sneered, "Well said. Your sharp tongue is admirable&mdash;you're certainly no pushover. But unfortunately for you, there's nothing you can do to stop this. In fact, you'll even end up helping me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn clenched her teeth, her voice sharp and resolute. "Help you? </span><span>Dream on</span><span>, Vincent. I'd rather die than help someone like you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so?" Vincent shrugged nonchalantly. Then, with a wave of his hand, he commanded, "Take her. Break her limbs and strip her of her superpower."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his order, a dozen men in black surged forward. "Yes, sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the crowd, Rose's voice rang out, firm and defiant. "You've forced my hand, Vincent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next instant, a thick mist began to spread, rippling outward. With a series of loud crashes, the mist&mdash;charged with immense power&mdash;caught the black-clad men off guard, sending them flying in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But before Rose could draw another breath, Malakar darted through the chaos like a phantom. With a single swipe of his hand, he struck her with enough force to send her flying.</span></p></div>
