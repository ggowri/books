        <h1>Chapter 48 The Sharpshooter</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony understood Dariel's intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he wanted to enter the manor, he first needed to prove his worth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only after demonstrating his strength could he justify his claims of protecting Rose and killing the werewolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Anthony lacked confidence in his ability to defeat Dariel and was reluctant to engage in a fight&mdash;especially before even stepping foot inside Turner Manor&mdash;he realized he had no choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To refuse now would paint him as a loser dependent on women, turning his supposed </span><span>protection of Rose and killing the werewolves into a laughingstock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing Anthony's hesitation, Alvin chimed in eagerly, "Captain Stein, you give this guy too much credit. He's a nobody, relying on drugs for a temporary boost. He doesn't have real strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel shook his head. "No one can kill a werewolf relying solely on the short-lived effects of drugs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deputy captain, Sergio Lowery, scoffed, "I've seen the aftermath. So many gunmen dead&mdash;it's unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, do you dare claim you were the one who shot them all?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you even ever held a gun?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sergio's fierce expression and shifty eyes hinted at his malicious nature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, filled with anger, retorted, "That's right! I shot them. Want to find out firsthand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sergio immediately whipped out his gun, aiming it at Anthony's head, teeth gritted. "You think you can challenge me? I'll put you down right here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony turned to Dariel. "I'm willing to fight. Do you want to keep it civilized, or are we going to the death? If it's the latter, I can't promise your men will survive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel replied seriously, "Until we uncover the truth, let's keep it controlled. Sergio, instruct your men to load blanks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he handed Anthony a magazine of blank ammunition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sergio laughed in disdain. "Anthony, you're clearly scared of me, but you claim to care about our safety. You're just bluffing. Don't worry; I can still teach you a lesson with blanks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His ten men laughed as they loaded their weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To them, Anthony was just a loser without real skills&mdash;someone who loved to boast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, they would teach Anthony a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony loaded the blanks, looked at Sergio, and smirked. "Back then, I was backed against the wall, attacked from three sides. If you want to replicate that moment, come at me together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked up the M9 submachine gun and walked toward the distant wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sergio, furious, shot back, "You dare belittle me? I can..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony cut him off, raising his gun and firing a shot without looking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A loud bang echoed as smoke erupted just in front of Sergio's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stunned, Sergio exclaimed, "How dare you shoot at me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony fired again, and smoke billowed from Sergio's left chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If those had been real bullets, he would have been shot directly in the heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sergio was momentarily speechless, stunned into silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel, taken aback, whispered, "He truly is a sharpshooter. Stay alert. Follow his lead and shoot from three sides."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fuming, Sergio spread his men out to surround Anthony on three fronts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted, then pulled the trigger first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony stood exposed, completely vulnerable; how could he possibly evade the onslaught?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the next heartbeat, they witnessed something unforgettable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony twisted his body mid-air, expertly avoiding all of Sergio's bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?" Sergio shouted, regaining his composure. "Everyone, fire at once! We can't let him get away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, his men on both sides complied, unleashing a barrage of bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was thick with gunfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a fly wouldn't survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body twisted and moved with an almost supernatural grace, evading the bullets as if he had mastered the laws of physics. Finally, when all the shots were fired, he began his counterattack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't need to aim; he simply fired randomly with the M9, taking out guards one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the bullets were blanks, they still caused significant pain upon impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner guards howled in agony, their cries escalating into screams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin, Anne, and the others were left dumbfounded, watching in disbelief. Setting aside Anthony's attack, the Turner Guards were just too fragile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn't this just blank ammunition? Were they really in so much pain?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How embarrassing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel's expression turned grave. Only he noticed that every bullet fired by Anthony struck the same spot on the guards, especially Sergio, who was right in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each shot landed precisely on Sergio's heart, and even blanks could inflict considerable pain when delivered with such accuracy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Sergio screamed, blood spilling from his mouth as he collapsed backward.</span></p></div>
