        <h1>Chapter 155 Blood Shadow Saber</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony?" </span><span>Necros</span><span> smirked coldly, flicking a stone between his fingers, raising an eyebrow as he looked at Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's heart skipped when he saw the stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the very one he had thrown at </span><span>Necros</span><span>, and yet, he'd caught it with his bare hand. That alone spoke volumes about how strong this guy was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's eyes sharpened, wariness creeping into his mind. He asked, "Who are you? </span><span>A hitman the Smith family sent, or someone from the Evil Spirit Legion?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Necros</span><span> stared at Anthony, a sly grin playing on his lips, and shot back, "Does it really matter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed completely unfazed, exuding confidence in his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony let out a dry chuckle, shrugging. "Guess it doesn't."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could even finish his sentence, </span><span>Necros</span><span> raised his arm, smoothly drawing a jet-black machete from his waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of the machete scraping the scabbard was sharp and grating, cutting through the silence of the valley like nails on a chalkboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Necros</span><span> eyed the machete, then casually asked, "</span><span>Archlord</span><span> </span><span>Iscairn</span><span> mentioned you killed NT-681?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony frowned, clearly puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obvious that NT-681 was a codename, something the Evil Spirit Legion used often.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anthony had taken out plenty of their people and still had no clue who this particular codename referred to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing Anthony's confusion, </span><span>Necros</span><span> continued, as if it were no big deal, "He was the one leading the assault on the Turner family. His codename was NT-681."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, it was referring to Arthur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Anthony realized that </span><span>Necros</span><span> was from the Evil Spirit Legion, he was slightly shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Legion was fast. He had barely entered the mountains, and they were already on his tail. It seemed they'd been following him all the way from Yoland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still pretending not to know, Anthony asked, "So you're with the Evil Spirit Legion?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you guys only use codenames, or do you actually know each other's real names?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked, partly to be cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If </span><span>Necros</span><span> knew Arthur's real name, it might be time to rethink the one he'd been using.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still wasn't sure who this </span><span>Archlord</span><span> </span><span>Iscairn</span><span> was, but he had a feeling it might be Arthur's informant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A puppet. Names don't matter," </span><span>Necros</span><span> said dismissively, his tone calm and uninterested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony wasn't in a hurry either. He threw the question back, "What about you? No name? Just another puppet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Necros</span><span>' expression darkened, and his voice took on an edge of anger. "Remember this. My name is </span><span>Necros</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Necros</span><span>, huh?" Anthony smirked, raising an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that a nickname? Sounds like it's supposed to be fancy. Does it make you feel more important? A high-level puppet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what about </span><span>Archlord</span><span> </span><span>Iscairn</span><span>? An even higher-ranking puppet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Necros</span><span>' temper snapped. "Enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, his sleeve flicked, and the stone he had been playing with shot through the air with deadly force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It flew like a speeding bullet, the sheer power behind it enough to make the air crackle </span><span>with energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was ready. With a quick shift of his foot, he effortlessly dodged the stone that flew toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It zipped past, and a flash of cold light aimed straight at his face. </span><span>Necros</span><span>' massive frame moved in a strange, almost unnatural way, speeding toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His machete shimmered in the night, cutting through the air with lethal intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Warrior, huh?" Anthony smirked, muttering under his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he kicked into Whirlwind Step, darting sideways with a speed that left a blur behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he moved, </span><span>Necros</span><span> transformed into a streak of light, blocking his escape route in an instant. His machete came down with deadly precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's heart skipped a beat at the insane speed. The cockiness he'd felt earlier was gone, replaced by the full focus of a man facing a real threat. He pushed his speed even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The machete slashed through the air, missing him by a hair's breadth. A sharp gust from the machete cut across his cheek, leaving a burning pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Necros</span><span> was clearly a B-level Warrior, fast as lightning and deadly with his sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony kept dodging, but </span><span>Necros</span><span> wouldn't relent. His machete carved through the </span><span>air,</span><span> a flash of light followed by a burst of cutting force. It was fierce and </span><span>unstoppable</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When it became clear that normal swordplay wouldn't do the trick, </span><span>Necros</span><span>' whole body trembled. A crushing aura exploded from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blood Shadow Saber!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Necros</span><span> shouted as a second machete appeared in his left hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a split second, his battle intent soared, and the air around him felt sharp enough to cut through stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With two machetes now, his speed was even more overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the dark night, it felt as if he'd become one with the shadows, his machetes dancing and flashing with terrifying precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a dozen exchanges, Anthony, just a little too careless, felt a sharp sting across his chest as one of the machetes grazed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold rush filled his chest as his shirt was torn open, leaving a deep gash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the machete had been even slightly slower, it might've torn through him entirely, and he wouldn't be standing here anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"NT-681 was a joke... Go to hell!" </span><span>Necros</span><span>' face darkened as he muttered to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting a second, he charged again, faster and more vicious than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed of his attacks kept increasing, and Anthony's dodges were becoming more desperate. It wasn't that his Whirlwind Step wasn't fast enough. It was just that </span><span>Necros</span><span> was too strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From their brief exchange, Anthony could tell this guy wasn't just good with one style of machete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The way he attacked told him he was blending at least a dozen different techniques, each one powerful in its own right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Honestly, </span><span>Necros</span><span> was the toughest and most relentless Warrior Anthony had faced yet.</span></p></div>
