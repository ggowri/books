        <h1>Chapter 4 Dignity</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Anthony had expected, the entire city's attention was glued to the extravagant </span><span>engagement banquet between Anne and Alvin. People assumed Anthony had already fled Yoland, hiding somewhere and too scared to show his face. The joke of the town was quickly forgotten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything went smoothly as Anthony arrived outside the Smith Manor. After hiding the Hellfire Bike in a narrow alley behind the estate, he scaled the wall, avoided the bodyguard patrols, and sneaked into the small building where he and Anne had been staying. Once inside the bedroom, he began searching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the bottom of a jewelry box, his fingers brushed against the Dragon Ring, black and gleaming. Just as he was about to slip it on, an angry voice came from behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You useless piece of trash, how dare you come back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony froze in shock and quickly spun around. The bathroom door swung open, revealing Scarlet Smith, Anne's stepmother, dressed in a sexy purple camisole, with a massive emerald pendant hanging from her neck. She was glaring at him, eyes full of fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw the ring in his hand, her rage flared. Pointing at him, she spat, "You're nothing but trash! My daughter threw you out, and after stealing millions in jewels, you're still not satisfied? Now you're back here, trying to steal more?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Put that down, now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlet wasn't just Anne's stepmother but also Alvin's aunt. Her high standing in the Smith family meant she could order Anthony around without question. Whenever she was unhappy, she would either slap him or shout at him. Anthony had always been afraid of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under normal circumstances, he would've already groveled and begged for forgiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But today was different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony slowly slid the Dragon Ring onto his left index finger, a cold smirk crossing his face. "I'm here to take back what's mine. You don't have a say in it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard. How dare you talk back? Give me that ring!" she screamed, rushing toward him to grab it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony quickly raised his hand, and as the ring gleamed with a burst of star-like light, he heard a sudden ding in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dragon Ring activated. The Chosen Path begins. Step one: reclaim your dignity as a man!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, his Devil Eye flickered to life. A blue light shone from his left eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through that light, he could see inside the Dragon Ring. There, in a small, narrow space, was a glowing blue dagger with the word "Dragonfang" carved into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony knew what he had to do. He had to use this dagger to reclaim the dignity that was rightfully his as a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought back to the years he had spent in the Smith family, working like a slave, swallowing his pride, his dignity trampled into the dirt. And today, he was kicked out like a stray dog, his face was utterly ruined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands tightened into fists, and a burning vow rose within him. "I will get my revenge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You worthless trash! That's our family's property! Put it down, now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or I swear I'll kill you!" Scarlet screamed, fury twisting her features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to reach Anthony's raised hand due to their height difference, she jumped up, trying to grab his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony glanced down, his eyes inadvertently catching sight of her chest, which heaved dramatically beneath her purple dress. Her body brushed against his, sending an unexpected surge of heat through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You worthless thing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anne was right to kick you out! Just so you know, I'm the one who introduced her to Alvin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't let go right now, I'll have them come over and beat you to death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to take it any longer, Anthony swung his hand and slapped Scarlet hard across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force of the slap was so strong that it sent her crashing onto the nearby bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never imagined that Anthony would ever dare lay a hand on her. She froze, her hand instinctively pressing against her stinging cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You hit me? You useless nobody, how dare you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was full of disbelief, her eyes wide in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's gaze lingered on her curvy figure, the fire in his eyes burning hotter. She was pushing forty, yet her natural beauty and the way she took care of herself made her look like she was in her early thirties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her allure was much more captivating than that of any young woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think I'm useless, huh? Well, today I'm going to show you what a real man is like!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Anthony yanked his belt from his waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing? You piece of shit..." Scarlet tried to shout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish, Anthony whipped the belt across her backside with a sharp crack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden sting made her gasp in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't believe that the weak, pathetic Anthony would actually dare strike her like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spun around, about to curse him out, but froze when she saw his pants fall, revealing the bulge under his underwear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony climbed onto the bed, grabbing Scarlet's skirt before ripping it off in one swift, forceful motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlet gasped in shock, left completely exposed in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shout, you bitch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you still think you're better than me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you still going to pick on me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony finally snapped, swinging his belt and lashing it across Scarlet's body, not holding back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood-red marks on Scarlet's skin were clear, but her cries began to change. What started as screams soon turned into moans, as though she was deriving a strange satisfaction from the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were filled with hunger as they fixed on Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she saw him as something powerful and irresistible, his chiseled features and sculpted body exuding a primal, magnetic energy.</span></p></div>
