        <h1>Chapter 188 No Way Out</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mordred was in a completely different league than </span><span>Necros</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony had no doubts about that. The sheer power of his defense and his lightning-fast speed were enough to strike fear into anyone's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Rose was gripped with anxiety, a barrage of gunfire erupted in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the smoke and muzzle flashes, Anthony charged forward, wielding his Gatling gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene that unfolded before them was unbelievable&mdash;Mordred, a burly man, was charging straight at Anthony while shrugging off the Gatling's devastating firepower like it was nothing more than a light rain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This defense was absolutely insane!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony felt his blood run cold. Back when he'd faced </span><span>Necros</span><span>, his Gatling had at least been able to keep him at bay. But now, even this devastating weapon could barely slow Mordred's advance, and even that slight effect seemed pathetic at best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rain of bullets might as well have been water droplets against steel&mdash;they couldn't even scratch Mordred's defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony had never seen anything like it. The situation hit him like a ton of bricks&mdash;if the Gatling couldn't stop Mordred, he was as good as dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood sprayed from Anthony's mouth as Mordred's devastating kick sent him flying nearly fifty feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body shattered into fragments of light before vanishing completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he reformed, Anthony coughed up another mouthful of blood, his face draining of all color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were worlds apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mordred towered over him like some mythical giant, possessing a power that seemed to break every rule of fairness. Each aspect of his abilities made him seem like an invincible force of nature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what really made Anthony's stomach turn was a simple, terrifying fact&mdash;this was just Mordred. Above him stood Astaroth, the leader of the Four Demon Lords. And if Mordred was this powerful, Astaroth would be in a whole different league entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony!" The shout echoed through the air. "Your time has come!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mordred's footsteps thundered against the ground as he approached, each step resonating with ominous power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His giant frame towered like a mountain over Anthony, regarding him with the same contempt one might show an insect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a metallic ring, Mordred's arm trembled as crimson light coalesced into a blood-red spear three feet in length. The weapon's color was almost painful to look at.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he twirled the massive spear through the air, its tip found Anthony's throat, radiating an ice-cold killing intent that seemed to pierce straight through to the soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as Mordred prepared to strike, the unexpected happened. A massive boulder&mdash;more like a small hill, really&mdash;suddenly erupted from the ground nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight was surreal&mdash;this miniature mountain, easily thirty feet across, defied gravity as it rose into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like a meteor plummeting to Earth, the enormous rock mass suddenly reversed direction, hurtling down toward Mordred with devastating force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the&mdash;?" Mordred's eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no time to dodge. Gripping his spear with both hands, Mordred summoned an eerie red glow around the weapon and thrust it upward at the descending boulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact was deafening. As Mordred's spear connected with the massive rock, it exploded into countless fragments that went flying in all directions, creating a storm of stone shrapnel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's eyes widened in shock as he sprinted away from the impact zone. And with good reason&mdash;each chunk of shattered rock was easily the size of three human heads!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he dodged the debris, Anthony risked a glance over his shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight was almost comical&mdash;Mordred, who had seemed as immovable as a mountain moments ago, lay face-down in the dirt, buried under a chaotic spray of broken rocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anthony couldn't savor the moment. His attention snapped to Carolyn, and what he saw made his breath catch in his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood defiantly, her entire body surrounded by an ethereal earthen aura, with tiny fragments of stone swirling around her like a protective shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Carolyn?" Hope surged through Anthony's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go!" Carolyn's face remained grim, betraying none of the relief Anthony felt. "Get Rose out of here, now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Anthony could protest, she cut him off with steely determination. "I can't hold him back forever, but better one of us falls than all three. Besides," she added with calculated certainty, "Vincent won't dare kill me until he has full control of the Turner family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice softened slightly. "As long as Rose lives, the Turner family has a chance for survival."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Anthony and bowed deeply. "Mr. Johnson, I'm entrusting this to you. Please."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Argh!" A thunderous roar of rage echoed across the landscape as Mordred exploded in fury. "You </span><span>bitch</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn didn't waste time with words. With a swift motion of her arm, scattered rocks flew together, coalescing into a massive hill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In one fluid movement, she hurled the makeshift mountain at Mordred with incredible speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of here!" Carolyn shouted when she saw Anthony hesitating. With a wave of her hand, she summoned a wave of sand that sent him flying several dozen feet back, landing next to Rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run! Now!" she commanded. "If you stay, none of us will make it out alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run?" Mordred's voice dripped with murderous intent. "Not a chance in hell! Today, you're all going to die. Every last one of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation was growing desperate. As Carolyn struggled to maintain her position, Mordred smashed through her rocky barrier with a single punch and charged toward her like a raging bull.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His massive frame barreled forward with terrifying force, his body emanating an eerie, blood-red mist that spoke of uncontrolled fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Carolyn!" Anthony's voice cracked with emotion. "Hold on! I swear I'll come back for you. I swear!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, Anthony knew Carolyn was right. On her own, she stood a chance of survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if he stayed, they'd all be slaughtered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's eyes burned red as he weighed his options.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that he lacked the courage to fight to the death. The brutal truth was that it would be pointless. He was simply outmatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sure, he and Carolyn might be able to take down one Mordred if they worked together, but what about the other three Demon Lords waiting in the wings? Staying here would be nothing short of suicide.</span></p></div>
