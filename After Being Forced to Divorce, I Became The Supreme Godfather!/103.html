        <h1>Chapter 102 Beyond Redemption</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the moment Carolyn fell to the ground, the sand-crafted dagger sliced through Mason's throat with unstoppable force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dagger flashed past, leaving a mist of blood in its wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason let out a howl. The immense impact nearly made him collapse. He stumbled a few steps before regaining his balance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn looked up and sighed inwardly, "Too bad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason's reaction speed was too quick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the dagger wasn't infinitely powerful, it was swift, striking from a tricky angle, and Carolyn had launched it as a surprise attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the head of the Turner family, Carolyn would have disdained to ambush a level-C metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with the Turner family in dire straits, she had to cast aside such scruples.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had thought this strike would kill Mason, but he evaded the attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dagger grazed his neck, tearing a nearly four-inch wound that bled profusely, yet not life-threatening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn felt a surge of despair and lay there, powerless, on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! You wicked woman! Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason was furious, roaring as he raised his foot and stomped the ground with force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a muffled thud, a boulder the size of a human head suddenly flew up, hurtling towards Carolyn's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn was nearly drained, covered in blood, her strength utterly depleted, and her face terrifyingly pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under normal circumstances, Carolyn wouldn't have given a stone a second thought, as it couldn't harm her in the slightest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, this relatively small stone could take her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Carolyn closed her eyes, ready to burn her essence, a figure flashed over, standing in front of her and shattering the incoming stone with a single claw strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner! Retreat! You should retreat to the safe house first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon closer look, it was Dariel. His stature was imposing, nearly a foot taller than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His clothes were in tatters, revealing his muscular body, riddled with scars and sparsely covered with hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, his eyes gleamed with a bestial ferocity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was his werewolf form!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judging by Dariel's appearance, he was on the verge of complete transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's heart leaped with joy, but the next moment, she couldn't help but feel sorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel seemed to be evolving, but the situation for the Turner family was dire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he did evolve, it might not make a difference, and he could still end up dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel was fiercely loyal to the Turner family and had contributed significantly to their cause on numerous occasions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Setting aside past battles, in this very fight, Dariel had already put his life on the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Curse you all. You will all die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Carolyn could ponder further, Mason cursed and charged again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quick! Escort Ms. Turner to retreat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel's eyes darkened. He abruptly spread his arms wide, his biceps bulging with veins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Retreat? You wish. Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Dariel's words fell, Mason sprinted towards them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After such a prolonged battle, Mason still appeared ferocious and full of strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone noticed this and found it strange, though they didn't know why.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Bastard, bring it on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel roared with bloodshot eyes, his gaze about to burst from its sockets as he met Mason in combat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Dariel's charging steps were noticeably unsteady, or rather, staggering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Dariel about to sacrifice himself, Carolyn shouted, "Dariel! Come back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a single strike, Dariel was sent flying back. Differently, his chest now bore a gruesome wound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wound was so deep that it exposed the bone, a mess of blood and flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolf's sharp claws had nearly torn open his chest from top to bottom. The flayed flesh was horrifying to behold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come quickly!" Carolyn rushed over and shouted, "Someone! Medication for Dariel! Hurry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Carolyn was shouting, another figure flew over from the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Jane!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's red dress was even more crimson now. It was stained red with blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Ronald!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's face drained of color in shock, and she yelled, "Someone! Bring the medicine! Quickly..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An elderly man in a white coat trembled as he said, "We... we have no more medicine..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's eyes turned red with anger as she scolded, "No more medicine? What does that mean?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you all for? Why is there no medicine?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could the Turner family run out of medicine? Bring the medicine now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's eyes were bloodshot as she raged furiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, Carolyn was overwhelmed with sorrow, tears silently streaming down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned her head to look around. Everywhere she saw were werewolves with terrifying fangs, howling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vast Turner Manor was in ruins, blood flowing like rivers and piles of corpses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family was heading toward decline beyond redemption.</span></p></div>
