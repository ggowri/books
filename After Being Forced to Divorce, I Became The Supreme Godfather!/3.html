        <h1>Chapter 3 The Chosen Path</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chosen Path? Successor?" Anthony asked, his face a picture of confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michael noticed his look and explained, "Listen up&mdash;becoming Godfather </span><span>ain't</span><span> a cakewalk. It's a gauntlet of death traps and mind games. That's the Chosen Path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Beat these trials, and you're the next supreme ruler. Everyone bows, hailing you as their king. Money, power, pussy - snap your fingers, it's yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's heart </span><span>raced,</span><span> blood pumping hot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">When I make it, Anne and Alvin are dead meat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Every </span><span style="font-style: italic;">su</span><span style="font-style: italic;">cker who laughed at </span><span style="font-style: italic;">me's</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">gonna</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> regret breathing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michael let out a cold, mirthless chuckle. "Slow your roll, kid. Before you hit the top, you're </span><span>gonna</span><span> eat shit and almost die. One slip-up? Game over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Top dogs walk alone. I won't save your ass. Even if you're bleeding out, that's on you. Your cross to bear. I'd stand by and let fate take its course."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's face went stone serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michael continued, "Look, if you're too scared of the Chosen Path, that's cool. You're still </span><span>family</span><span>. I'll set you up </span><span>nice</span><span> - live like a trust fund baby, zero worries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, tell me your choice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Michael's laser stare, Anthony went deep in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Chosen Path could get him killed, especially solo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Living rich and lazy had its perks, but that boring life felt like a total prison, which might destroy his soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the Chosen Path was sketchy as hell, the payoff was God-tier. If he could survive the test, he would become the next powerful Godfather!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything he wanted - his for the taking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Better yet? He could hit back at those scums who humiliated him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The memory hit like a truck - his wife throwing him out while flaunting her side piece. Rage burned through his veins, turning his vision blood red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like a caged wolf, Anthony's fists clenched as he roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Hell</span><span> yes! I'm taking the Path! I'll crush these trials and become the next Godfather!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michael's eyes flashed approval. "Good. Now get your Dragon Ring. That's step one on your journey."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Dragon Ring?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's mind drifted back to that somber-hued ring he'd worn since he was a kid. Left index finger. Never knew what it was made of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he married Anne, she'd bitched about how ugly it was until he took it off. So, he'd stashed it in their bedroom jewelry box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hard to believe that simple ring was a precious token left by Michael.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now he had to get it back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going now!" Anthony jumped up, ready to bolt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold up." Michael raised his hand. In an instant, a blue hologram screen popped up, looking straight out of sci-fi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"See where you stand right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The screen lit up with Yoland's hottest gossip online.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[BREAKING: Limp-dick Anthony marries Smith princess</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>can't get it up for 3 years!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[LOSER ALERT: Anthony got kicked to the curb with nothing. Most pathetic dude ever?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[POWER COUPLE: Anne &amp; Alvin's engagement bash tomorrow. Big money meets bigger money!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[WANTED: Anthony jacked Smith millions in jewels. Kill him, treasure's yours!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Shadow Tigers calling dibs on Anthony's head!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Axe Gang: That punk's dead meat!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[GET HIM - GET RICH!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It got even crazier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some psychos wanted to publicly chop his junk off. Called him a disgrace to men everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony just stood there, shell-shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That bitch Raina must've run her mouth to Anne. Now Anne and Alvin had cooked up this shit storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were framing him for the jewel theft, trying to get the gangs to do their dirty work and eliminate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michael shot him a look. "Hitting Smith Manor for that Dragon Ring is like walking into a death trap. Those hunters want your head. Whether you live or die - it's all on you now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But here's the deal - you're halfway up this mountain. You can take any ride from the garage. Good luck."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's brain kicked back into gear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smart players needed solid plans. Charging in like some dumbass hero? Pure suicide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Between the Smith and Blake hitmen, plus those trigger-happy thugs drooling over the jewels, he'd be Swiss cheese.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tomorrow night was perfect - Anne and Alvin's engagement party would have everyone distracted. Security was bound to slacken. Perfect time to slip in and grab that ring...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next night, Anthony transformed into a deadly predator, ready to hunt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the garage, his eyes locked onto a sick Hellfire Bike in the corner</span><span> </span><span>- matte black with wicked skull designs crawling up the </span><span>frame</span><span>. His face split into a wolf's grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Motorcycles were his thing. </span><span>Truth was</span><span>, he'd even paid bills as a stunt rider back in the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He straddled that beast and pulled on a mask, feeling like Ghost Rider incarnate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The engine screamed when he twisted the throttle. Then he was gone, tearing down that mountain road like a demon straight out of hell.</span></p></div>
