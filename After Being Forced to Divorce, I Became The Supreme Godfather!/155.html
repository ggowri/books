        <h1>Chapter 154 Necros</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Turner Manor, Rose couldn't ignore Anthony's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a little while, once Anthony had left, she hesitated before deciding to call Carolyn. But just as she was about to dial, Carolyn's call came through first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, Aunt Carolyn?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rose, there's news about Vincent. The Mines have </span><span>Leyline</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Rose exclaimed, shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Leyline</span><span>? Are you serious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a member of the Turner family, Rose knew exactly what </span><span>Leyline</span><span> was, and how crucial they were for Warriors and Metahumans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a small piece of Spirit Stone was incredibly valuable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thing was, </span><span>Leyline</span><span> was extremely rare these days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yep!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vincent sent the news, and from what it looks like, the scale of </span><span>Leyline</span><span> is huge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, Carolyn had been worried about the situation at the mine, but then Vincent called her, practically bursting with excitement, confirming that they had discovered a massive </span><span>Leyline</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn, unable to contain her excitement, spoke quickly, and Rose, equally thrilled, asked, "Aunt Carolyn, what do we do next?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, we head to the Mines, of course!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need to go now. The sooner, the better!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's excitement was palpable. "I'll be back in half an hour. You get ready."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell Sergio to pick a team and have them ready in half an hour so we can head out overnight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's enthusiasm was understandable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family had been in decline for years, each generation weaker than the last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the head of the family, she was more anxious than anyone but felt helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the Turner family was about to possess a </span><span>Leyline</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A </span><span>Leyline</span><span> alone could bring back the family's former glory or even surpass it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it!" Rose could hardly contain her joy. She was so thrilled that she almost hung up right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, she remembered Anthony's warning and quickly added, "Aunt Carolyn, wait."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony had to step out for something, but before he left, he told me to let you know that something doesn't feel right about the mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He said we should wait for him to come back before doing anything rash."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a brief silence on the other end of the line before Carolyn responded, "Anthony is cautious, and he's only looking out for us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But he probably doesn't know about the </span><span>Leyline</span><span> yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The reason he felt something was off is because he couldn't reach Vincent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Vincent explained that he was unreachable because he took the lead and went into the mine himself to help with the excavation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's precisely because of his involvement that they discovered the </span><span>Leyline</span><span> so quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait..." Rose hesitated, concerned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Carolyn, Vincent took the lead? I don't know if I believe that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Vincent too well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent liked to exaggerate and take credit, so hearing that he took the lead seemed far-fetched to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn chuckled, clearly understanding her doubts. "I know. He's not the type to take the lead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But whatever the case, he sent the data confirming the </span><span>Leyline</span><span>, and it's nearly certain that the mine has them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So don't worry. You go ahead and tell Sergio to prepare. We leave in half an hour."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, and keep this to ourselves for now. Don't tell anyone else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it. I'll get everything in order." Seeing how firm Carolyn was, Rose stopped overthinking it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Carolyn said made sense. Anthony's concern came from the fact that Vincent couldn't be reached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now that Vincent had reached out to confirm the </span><span>Leyline</span><span> discovery, it showed his loyalty to the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any earlier worries were just unnecessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour later, Carolyn, along with Rose, Sergio, and more than thirty loyal guards, set off for the mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But halfway there, Rose still wasn't at ease. After quietly stepping away from Carolyn, she tried calling Anthony again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The call didn't go through, so she decided not to dwell on it any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the </span><span>Virstino</span><span> Mountains, Anthony moved with the speed of the wind, arriving at a hidden valley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly stopped and turned around, shouting, "I know you're from the Evil Spirit Legion. Stop hiding."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Show yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, Anthony flung a stone from his hand. The stone shot out like a bullet, slicing through the air with a sharp whoosh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stone flew about 30 feet before smashing through a thick tree, and moments later, a massive figure appeared from behind the tree.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person was over 6.5 feet tall, with broad shoulders and a muscular build, dressed in night gear with a black belt at his waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was none other than one of the Four Demon Lords, </span><span>Necros</span><span>.</span></p></div>
