        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking into Anthony's sincere eyes, Rose nodded and said, "Your name is Anthony, right? Please share your interpretation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one expected Rose to be so kind, offering Anthony a chance to speak. While Anne and the others seethed with frustration, they couldn't help but feel curious about what Anthony's answer would be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, they all gathered around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony spoke quietly, "Ms. Turner, could we find a quieter place to talk? After all, I'm sure you wouldn't want your innermost thoughts to be overheard by so many."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen immediately interjected, "Speak your mind here! Don't try to take advantage of the situation to get closer to Ms. Turner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Rose, moved by Anthony's gaze, suddenly felt he might truly understand her. A flicker of panic crossed her eyes as she realized that her true feelings weren't meant to be exposed to so many strangers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Helen, stay here with everyone. Mr. Johnson, please come with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose walked alone toward the wall, stopping beneath the painting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen and Anne, not daring to disobey Rose's command, could only watch as Anthony followed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing before the painting, Rose spoke softly, "Mr. Johnson, you may speak now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must also believe that I am a soul painter, and that these lines hide the mysteries of life, correct?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony smiled and replied, "It is indeed a soul creation, full of the mysteries of life. But not in the way they understand it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose, curious, looked at him. "Then what is it, in your view?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony lowered his voice, saying, "In truth, you weren't painting at all. These messy lines are just a reflection of your chaotic emotions. Am I right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose frowned. "Someone like me, a daughter of a prestigious family, how could I possibly have such chaotic emotions?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony explained, "It's precisely because you are that rare and revered figure, someone whom your family holds as their hope and everyone in Yoland looks up to, that they only see your brilliance and fail to notice your inner turmoil. Ms. Turner, you've just turned twenty, right? A twenty-year-old girl, trapped in a castle, controlled and molded like a puppet...how could you possibly be happy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose bit her lip, her voice barely audible, "Go on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony continued, "Your world has never been truly seen or respected. You came to Dragon Guild to issue this task not to find a bodyguard, but to find someone who could understand you, to have a conversation, to let your soul relax for once."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your soul, Ms. Turner, is suffocating, just like these entangled lines."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm right, aren't I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose's eyes began to redden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears shimmered in her beautiful eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they weren't tears of sadness. They were tears of gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For so many years, someone had finally seen through her stubbornness, not falling for her appearance or her family's legacy but truly listening to the voice within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the answer I wanted!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose said, her voice filled with appreciation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Rose, tears glistening in her eyes, Anthony suddenly felt a pang of tenderness. He realized how much this fragile girl had endured alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said softly, "Ms. Turner, what you need right now is a warm embrace. If you don't mind, I'd be happy to offer it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the warmth and sincerity in Anthony's eyes, she felt a friendship she had longed for but never experienced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she stepped into Anthony's embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're welcome. From now on, we're friends," Anthony said gently, holding her and whispering in her ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene stunned everyone nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially Anne and Alvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible? What did that worthless fool do to Ms. Turner? Why would she embrace him?" Alvin muttered, completely in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne, biting her lip until it bled, fumed with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That good-for-nothing! He's just using sweet words to win her over! I should have seen this coming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen rushed forward, shouting, "Ms. Turner, did this man drug you? I'll kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had to protect Rose's reputation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For so many years, Rose had been like a precious flower, carefully guarded and pure. She had never even held hands with a stranger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And today, she was embracing one in front of everyone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was explosive news!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would send shockwaves throughout Yoland!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To everyone's surprise, Rose halted Helen with a wave. She looked like a reclusive girl basking in the sunlight for the first time. She removed her veil, and her beautiful face was full of bright smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony passed the test. From now on, he's my friend. You're not allowed to be rude to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Johnson, as a diamond member, I have a private lounge here. Please, come with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen stood frozen, her face one of disbelief. She had never seen Rose smile so brightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at Anthony, utterly stunned. "What kind of magic did you use?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony gave her a mysterious smile and replied, "That's a secret."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked alongside Rose, heading toward the exit as the envious, jealous eyes of the </span><span>crowd followed them. At that moment, the voice of the Devil Eye rang in his mind. "Detecting that Rose is a Luna Avatar, complementary to your Solar Avatar."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Solar Avatar?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's thoughts raced. He quickly asked, "Devil Eye, when did I become a Solar Avatar?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Devil Eye responded, "Host has strengthened Leopard Avatar, which is an aspect of Solar. Therefore, Host now possesses Solar Avatar."</span></p></div>
