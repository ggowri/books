        <h1>Chapter 143 Initiative</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strong wind blew in their faces, containing extraordinary power. The gathered crowd subconsciously took a few steps back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before the dust cleared, Anthony and the Black Cloak each retreated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every step the two took was so powerful that the ground could not support them at all and broke apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene was so shocking that many people in the crowd gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of a Warrior was brutal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The punch was also a fight of sheer force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The key point was that after one punch, Anthony and the Black Cloak each retreated several steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evenly matched?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony could fight on equal terms with the famous Black Cloak?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the Black Cloak also displayed his proud skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was dumbfounded again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Cloak was quite famous in Yoland, and his strength was extraordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was just a piece of trash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, for them, once the Black Cloak made a move, Anthony would surely die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the two separated as soon as they touched each other. The powerful force was so strong that they took several steps back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though they were not Warriors, they could see that in this round, the two were evenly matched!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impossible! What kind of skill is that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not to mention that other people were shocked, even the Black Cloak couldn't help but frown and looked at Anthony in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Cloak was not only surprised by Anthony's strength, but also by his skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was sure that Anthony's skills were stronger than his!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Cloak thought, "But how was that possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony is just a loser. How could he have such powerful skills?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Black Cloak!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far away, Alvin's face darkened, and he said unhappily, "What are you doing? Hurry up and kill him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's just a piece of trash. No need to show mercy. Kill him right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin had absolute confidence in the Black Cloak's strength. He would never believe that Anthony could be on par with Black Cloak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, he thought the Black Cloak showed mercy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Cloak agreed confidently, but his eyes were always fixed on Anthony, not daring to move away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he stopped underestimating Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Anthony's power relied on drugs, he was indeed very strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the Black Cloak nod, Anthony laughed. "Don't you know that you shouldn't easily promise something you can't do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You knew you were no match for me, but you still agreed to it. You're embarrassing me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Cloak's face darkened, and he cursed angrily, "You bastard, how dare you speak so shamelessly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I admit that I underestimated you before, but I won't do that again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony said seriously, "Well, be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally took the initiative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He dares to take the initiative to attack?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this true? He can't be so arrogant just because the Black Cloak was careless for a moment, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, he is too ignorant. He took the initiative to get himself killed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd began to talk and looked at Anthony with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, Anthony had been on the passive defensive, which was a sign of weakness for someone who did not understand the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking the initiative to attack was what the strong did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And in their eyes, Anthony was obviously not a strong man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle outside the gate became more and more exciting, and everyone's attention was drawn to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the yard, Anne was silent. Ever since Ben was defeated, her expression had been gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, seeing Anthony taking the initiative to attack, Anne finally stopped hesitating and turned to walk towards Arthur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hastings, what do you think of Anthony's strength?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's face returned to its former charm. She spoke with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She seemed to be calm and composed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, her performance could not deceive Arthur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur was still holding the glass in his hand. He shook it and said thoughtfully, "It's not bad. He relied on drugs to force his potential, barely a Warrior."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words obviously made Anne relax a lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Arthur said, "But it seems that the Black Cloak could not win."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne was stunned and asked, "Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur smiled, "You should know Anthony better, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe in your heart, he is a loser, but you have to admit that he is not a reckless person, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that's the case, he chose to take the initiative and must be very confident that he can defeat the Black Cloak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's why you asked me for my opinion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Arthur raised his glass, drank the wine in one gulp, and stared at Anne steadily.</span></p></div>
