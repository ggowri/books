        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck!" Anthony cursed in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he quickly pulled back his leg at that moment and immediately dodged to the left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected, the moment Anthony pulled back his leg, a blade about one foot long extended from beneath Mason's black robe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blade flashed with a cold light, slashing through the air fiercely!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This powerful slash carried considerable force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This force coalesced into a single entity, transforming into an energy wave that shot out several feet before striking the ground forcefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the floor shattered, and dust was stirred!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony focused his gaze and saw that the hard marble had turned to powder. A knife mark over three feet long was left on the ground, looking extremely terrifying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was greatly shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the Devil Eye's warning, his kick would not only fail to injure Mason but also result in him losing a leg!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His head might have been shattered by this energy wave!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason was too cunning!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony pretended to be weak, and he chose to deal with him in the same way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony secretly prepared a decisive move for victory, and so did Mason!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What appeared to be an impulsive attack driven by rage actually contained a shocking determination and wisdom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Anthony had to admit that Mason's skills were clearly stronger than his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the help of Devil Eye, he would have died long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With another fatal strike failing, Mason was also stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just now, Anthony lifted his leg but retracted the attack midway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This behavior seemed too bizarre to Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason couldn't figure it out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This attack was supposed to be impossible to miss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But, Anthony managed to dodge it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony repeatedly avoided his fatal attacks in a bizarre way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Mason was stunned, Anthony reacted quickly and once again thrust Dragonfang at Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The timing was perfect, and the speed was incredibly fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Mason had just landed and was still in a state of disbelief and shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony didn't believe he could react to this strike!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before Dragonfang could cut Mason's neck, a foot suddenly extended from beneath the black robe!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He heftily kicked Anthony's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Anthony's strike and Mason's kick were executed with speed that reached its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything happened so fast that the Devil Eye didn't have time to warn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony completely withstood the attack and was sent flying off his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Level B metahuman's speed, strength, and reaction time are nothing to be trifled with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of Leopard Avatar had already made Anthony much stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this kind of strength seemed to still have a significant gap compared to that of a Level B metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Collapsing to the ground, Anthony spat out a mouthful of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, he huddled miserably in the corner, spreading his hands in a posture of surrender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony!" Not far away, Rose was shocked, screaming and instinctively rushing towards Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Turner, don't go over there!" Helen was startled and desperately held back Rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with a ghastly pale face, Helen ordered, "Hurry! Escort Ms. Turner to the safe room, hurry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her screams were mixed with sobs, and Helen was truly terrified. However, even in her fear, she still struggled to hold onto Rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn couldn't come to rescue them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was severely injured and unable to fight, while over a hundred werewolves were preparing to tear them apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Turner family was on the brink of destruction!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have no means of retaliation left! Prepare to die!" Mason roared to the sky, bellowing as he rapidly charged towards Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he sprinted, his black robe flapped wildly in the wind, his speed so fast that it was terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After such a fierce battle, Mason had also witnessed Anthony's cunning. Therefore, even though Anthony appeared to be in a desperate situation, Mason did not let his guard down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, although Anthony seemed weak, he was secretly watching him, with a blue light flickering above his left eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gathered all his strength from his entire body, focusing it recklessly into his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the Devil Eye's deduction, Anthony only had one chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He must go all out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Mason swung a long sword, slashing down fiercely!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when the long sword was less than three feet away from Anthony, he suddenly trembled, and the power of the Leopard Avatar erupted abruptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next second, Anthony lunged forward like a leopard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His speed was so fast that it even left a strange afterimage!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It flashed, mingled with a glint of cold light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While dodging the sword, Anthony jabbed at Mason's throat with Dragonfang at an ingenious angle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You despicable bastard!" Realizing Anthony's attack, Mason was taken aback and sharply turned his head as he shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dagger flashed past, and Dragonfang, being incredibly sharp, cut through Mason's </span><span>shoulder with unstoppable force!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, blood spurted from Mason's shoulder!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the next second, Mason countered back and punched Anthony away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At such a close distance, Anthony had no choice but to brace for the attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, this slash failed to hit Mason's vital spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, even if Anthony couldn't kill him just now, it would have been enough to severely wound him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He failed to grab the last chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap in strength was simply insurmountable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony thought, "Fuck!"</span></p></div>
