        <h1>Chapter 112 A Vow for Vengeance</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure," Arthur replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me. What plan do you have that will let me exact my revenge?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking some time to calm down, Arthur had regained his composure</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>True to his words, he was curious to see what plan Anthony had that warranted such confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony gave a faint smile and began. "First, you need to establish a private security firm in Yoland. Call it Draconic Shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Second, use Draconic Shield as a platform to secretly infiltrate and control the major families of Yoland."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur froze, eyebrows raised in disbelief. "You want me to establish... a security firm?" He almost scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is your brilliant strategy? To go up against the Evil Spirit Legion... with a company?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly." Anthony's voice was calm but resolute. "Do you think revenge comes that easily?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know as well as I do how powerful the Evil Spirit Legion is.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to take them down, you must build your strength. Or what do you plan to use for revenge? Raw passion and blind bravery?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't forget how you ended up under their control in the first place. How they enslaved you with a soul contract."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I&mdash;" Arthur opened his mouth but found no words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's pointed reminder struck a chord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur had tried the path of fiery vengeance once before, driven by his unrelenting desire to destroy the Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead of victory, he had been captured and forced to serve them, committing unspeakable atrocities under their command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's laughter broke the silence, dry and knowing. "Did you think my idea of an opportunity was to have you repeat the same mistakes?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grow up, Arthur. Bravery is meaningless without a plan. Do you have it in you to think beyond raw emotion for once?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur's frustration boiled over, but he exhaled heavily, nodding. "Fine. I'll do it. From now on, I'll follow your lead. Just tell me what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't care about anything else&mdash;as long as I can avenge myself. I'll gladly die for it if I have to."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then go." Anthony waved a hand dismissively. "And be quick about it. I won't wait forever. Find the resources&mdash;people, funding&mdash;whatever you need.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can't even set up a simple security firm, don't bother coming back to me. You're not ready for revenge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No problem." Arthur rose immediately, his determination rekindled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Foster..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of six werewolves approached, their expressions wary and confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur turned to look at them, his eyes lighting up. He glanced back at Anthony. "Anthony, if you could lift my soul contract, does that mean... you could do the same for them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "Are you asking to take them with you for Draconic Shield?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur nodded enthusiastically. "If your goal is to use Draconic Shield as a platform, then it needs strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These six are natural-born werewolves, powerful and skilled. They're perfect recruits, ready to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And there are others in the Turner family too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur was shrewd, and Anthony appreciated that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting words, Anthony activated Devil Eye, releasing the soul contracts binding the six werewolves to the Evil Spirit Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Anthony wasn't one to take unnecessary risks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Devil Eye had a unique and powerful ability: the power to form new soul contracts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, as he freed them from their previous servitude, he simultaneously etched his own </span><span>soul contract into their very beings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Greetings, Mr. Johnson!" The six werewolves dropped to one knee in unison, their voices firm with newfound allegiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike the contracts of the Evil Spirit Legion, Anthony's soul contract was far more potent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It instilled unshakable loyalty, rooting their devotion deep within their souls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, it left their consciousness and individuality intact, ensuring they could think and act freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well done," Anthony said, nodding in satisfaction. "From now on, you will answer to Arthur and follow his commands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Johnson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolves rose, stepping back behind Arthur, who was visibly astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Johnson," Arthur said, his tone filled with wonder. "You... you can form soul contracts as well?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Indeed," Anthony replied with a slight nod, making no attempt to hide it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur's eyes lit up with excitement. "Then... could you form one with me as well?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Anthony froze, momentarily caught off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Arthur just request a soul contract?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!" Arthur affirmed, determined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued earnestly, "Anthony, I've already decided to follow you. Whether or not I'm bound by a contract doesn't change that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, the Evil Spirit Legion is full of cunning and deceit. I fear that if I were ever captured again, they could force me into another soul contract.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've already experienced how fragile personal willpower can be in their hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, rather than risk falling into their clutches again and being made to do evil, I'd rather willingly form a contract with you. That way, I can serve you loyally and die without regret."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony chuckled, amused by Arthur's candor and sharp thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't deny the man's prudence and foresight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing no reason to refuse, Anthony activated Devil Eye once more, forming a soul contract with Arthur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After discussing a few details, Anthony dismissed them with a wave of his hand. "You're to go to Celestial Palace and find someone called Seraph."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Johnson." Arthur and his group nodded. With the efficiency of the wind, they departed the desolate canyon known as Phantom Hollow.</span></p></div>
