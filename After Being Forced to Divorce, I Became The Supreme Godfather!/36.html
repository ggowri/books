        <h1>Chapter 35 The Mutant Werewolf</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the side of the road in the distance, inside a sleek Rolls-Royce, Anne and Alvin watched the scene unfold through the tinted windows, their eyes widening in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their minds, Anthony was nothing more than a sniveling, cowardly loser. When had he become so fearless?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last time they'd seen him at their engagement party, Anthony had caused a commotion, but they chalked it up to some temporary hormone drug giving him false courage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could he have injected himself again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of drug could sustain its effects for so long?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't even take down a single piece of trash?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Useless cowards!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him! Now! The two hundred million bounty is yours for the taking!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin spat, furious. He banged on the car window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His display of fury mixed with helplessness sparked a flicker of disgust in Anne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "All he could do was yell from the safety of the car, like a coward hiding behind a mask of arrogance. He had no real skill, and he was gay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of the video that Anthony had played, the one that showed Alvin being fucked by another man, Anne felt a wave of nausea rose in her throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, outside the car, Anthony stood like a warrior surrounded by enemies. Dozens of killers swarmed him, yet he didn't flinch. He didn't retreat. Instead, he fought with a growing ferocity, like a hero who thrived on the chaos of battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne felt a pang of regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she had known how powerful Anthony truly was, she never would have dumped him for Alvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, come on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the manor, Helen cheered, her voice full of excitement and worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose saw a man in black silently sneak up behind Anthony and throw a punch at the back of his head. Her heart leaped into her throat. "Anthony, watch out!" she screamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anthony didn't need her warning. With the help of Devil Eye, he had a 360-degree view of everything within ten feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already spotted the assassin creeping up behind him, preparing for a sneak attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The assassin's fist didn't seem particularly powerful. Anthony wasn't concerned. He dispatched the two enemies in front of him with a quick slash of his dagger and spun around, letting out a roar like a tiger. His fist collided with the attacker's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His punch carried the might of a tiger. By all rights, it should have shattered the attacker's fist and arm upon impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as their fists were about to collide, the Devil Eye's warning screamed in his mind, "Danger! Retreat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simultaneously, Anthony caught sight of the attacker's grin. The fist, initially unimpressive, suddenly ballooned to twice its size, as if inflated, and the nails on his hand jutted out like steel claws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orc!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought flashed in Anthony's mind, but it was too late to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of backing off, Anthony doubled down, pouring all his strength into the collision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their fists met with a force that sent the attacker flipping through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony staggered back, blood trickling from a crack in his fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wiped the blood from his chest and looked up just in time to see the attacker land gracefully on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man slowly raised his head and gave Anthony a sinister grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the moonlight, fangs began to protrude from his mouth. His body expanded, muscles bulging as his clothes tore apart, revealing rough, animalistic skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his head to the moon and let out a spine-chilling howl, a sound that echoed through the night like a call to his hidden companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A mutant werewolf!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, come inside quickly! You can't fight him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the room, Rose screamed in terror and desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony had never expected to encounter mutant werewolves among the killers. These were not ordinary men. They were notorious for their brutality and savagery. And there was no way ordinary gangs could afford to hire them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given the situation, it seemed Alvin and Anne might have placed a bounty on his head, but this was no ordinary assassination attempt; it was far more intense and calculated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was well-acquainted with the underworld in Yoland. The most formidable killer there was, at best, only half a warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surveying the entirety of Yoland, the sole employer with the means to hire mutant werewolves would likely be the Turner family, with their thousand-year legacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony caught the werewolf's gaze shift towards the door behind him! A sudden realization hit him like a punch to the gut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These elite killers weren't just here to assassinate him. They were using the cover of the bounty to hunt Rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, come in now! What are you waiting for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose's voice broke through his thoughts. She had already opened the door, ready to pull him inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't open the door!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay inside and don't come out!" Anthony barked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dashed to block the entrance, his gaze locked on the werewolf. With teeth clenched, he growled, "Kiddo! Today, I'll find out just how tough you mutant werewolves really are!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on! Show me what you've got!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolf snarled, dropping onto all fours like a beast. He let out a low growl, ready to pounce. With a powerful leap, he soared through the air, aiming at Anthony's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony caught sight of the sharp fangs and recoiled at the foul stench emanating from his maw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony braced himself, waiting for the right moment. As the creature lunged, Anthony swung Dragonfang with all his might, aiming for the beast's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the werewolf was faster than expected. He twisted in mid-air, narrowly avoiding the fatal blow. His clawed paws swiped across Anthony's shoulder and landed gracefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dagger managed to nick his fur, while his razor-sharp claws grazed Anthony's </span><span>shoulder, drawing blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scent of blood only seemed to enrage the werewolf further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He threw back his head and howled at the moon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What plunged Anthony into despair was not just the howling but the sight of a killer in black emerging on either side, each slowly crouching and morphing into the unmistakable form of a werewolf.</span></p></div>
