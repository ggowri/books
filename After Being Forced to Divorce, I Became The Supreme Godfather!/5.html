        <h1>Chapter 5 Revenge Began</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I deserve this! Don't stop. Keep going!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Anthony planned to stop, Scarlet even started begging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her wet, Anthony realized that this woman had a taste for being controlled. A wave of intense desire hit him, and in that moment, he knew he was going to take full advantage of the situation tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He set his phone to record and placed it nearby, then, seeing the burning desire in Scarlet's eyes, he couldn't hold back any longer and lunged at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlet had been living alone for years, and most nights, she could only rely on the electric toys she secretly ordered online to fulfill her needs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how many she bought, nothing could compare to the real thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was completely filled, overwhelmed by a wave of pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, you're amazing! Please, I can't take it anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just too incredible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tonight, Anne and Alvin were getting engaged. As the one who matched them, she was the center of attention at the party.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She purposely showed up late, intending to sneak into Anne's room to pick out a piece of jewelry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the emerald pendant she had picked swayed wildly with every thrust, dangling from her neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was babbling nonsense, completely overwhelmed by Anthony's relentless assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The commotion caught the attention of the guard dog downstairs, which began barking wildly at the building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy Falls, the deputy captain left behind to guard the manor, arrived with two subordinates to investigate. When they heard Scarlet's groans coming from inside the room, Timothy froze in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, all the key family members had left early for the engagement banquet. But to his surprise, Scarlet was hiding in the house, having an affair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy was torn. He wanted to burst in, but he was afraid of Scarlet's wrath. At the same time, he felt uneasy just walking away. So, he decided to call Anne to report what was going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the engagement party still an hour away, Anne, looking elegant and radiant, was greeting guests and overseeing the banquet preparations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she heard Timothy's report, she rushed to her phone and opened an app to check the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, she had secretly installed hidden cameras in her room to keep Anthony from stealing anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the screen opened, she saw a shocking sight. Scarlet, completely at Anthony's mercy, was caught in the heat of passion. Anne's eyes widened in disbelief, her face drained of color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, you're amazing! It feels incredible. I'm about to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Scarlet's moans echoed through the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guests and Smith family members, who had been chatting nearby, all turned to look in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing what had happened, Anne quickly turned off the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was too late. The sound had already been heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? On the day of the engagement, Ms. Smith is secretly watching a porn?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems Anthony must have kept Ms. Smith so lonely, she has to watch this kind of stuff to relieve herself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, I think I heard that woman call Anthony's name?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confusion spread through the room as all eyes turned to Anne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face flushed with embarrassment, and her mind raced. She couldn't help but think that Anthony, unable to have her, was now taking out his frustrations on her stepmother, imagining her as herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Timothy, go in immediately and capture Anthony!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's stealing things from the room!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm heading back right now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ben, bring all the bodyguards and follow me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stormed out, furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy was a skilled fighter who had always looked down on Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the bounty placed by Anne and Alvin earlier, he had been itching for an opportunity to catch Anthony. He planned to teach him a lesson and maybe even claim the valuable jewelry Anthony had stolen for himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could go looking for Anthony, the man had practically walked into his hands. It was an unexpected stroke of luck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately slammed the door, but it had already been locked from the inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Break down the door!" Timothy ordered his men, his patience wearing thin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he issued an urgent command through his earpiece to the rest of the estate's security. "Everyone, gather at Ms. Smith's building immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's bedroom door was reinforced with heavy armor, and no amount of brute strength could break it down. Fuming, Timothy stepped back, drew his gun, and fired several shots at the lock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a loud bang, the lock shattered, and with a powerful kick, Timothy barged into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Smith, where's Anthony?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he looked around, he froze. Scarlet was sprawled on the bed, wrapped in a blanket. Her sexy slip dress and underwear were scattered across the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still recovering from the waves of pleasure, Scarlet lay weakly on the bed, her voice barely audible. "Anthony? Didn't he escape the city after being wanted? I don't know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I screamed because I slipped in the shower accidentally," she added, her eyes nervously glancing toward the door behind Timothy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy's instincts kicked in, and he turned to search behind the door. Just as he did, a flash of steel appeared, and a sharp blade sliced into his hand, severing it and sending </span><span>his gun flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Howling in pain, Timothy staggered back, his two subordinates charging forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anthony was faster. He kicked out with lightning speed, sending both of the trained bodyguards crashing across the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony quickly grabbed the fallen gun and tucked it into his waistband. As Timothy charged at him again, Anthony sidestepped, spun around, and slashed a knife across his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy collapsed, roaring in pain as he fell to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't expect this, did you? How does it feel to fall into my hands?" Anthony sneered, a cruel smile tugging at the corner of his lips.</span></p></div>
