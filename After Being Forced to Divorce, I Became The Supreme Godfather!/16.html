        <h1>Chapter 16 No One Knows Him</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you just say? You want Ms. Ronald to come out and welcome you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you out of your mind? This useless man, kicked to the curb, has snapped and gone insane!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He dares to make such arrogant claims in front of Dragon Guild's gates, and even insult Ms. Ronald! He deserves to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quick, kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Anthony's words, the crowd erupted in fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To avoid being implicated, they quickly retreated, forming a wide circle around him, leaving Anthony standing alone in the center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four Dragon Guards drew their guns, aiming them squarely at Anthony, their teeth gritted as they warned, "How dare you cause trouble here and trample on the honor of Dragon Guild! Apologize immediately, or we'll shoot you dead right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the weapons in their hands, the M9 Micro Submachine Guns he'd bought at Dragon Ring Store. Anthony couldn't help but feel a strange sense of familiarity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his current abilities, he could easily defeat these four Dragon Guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Dragon Group was his grandfather's business, and soon, once he became Godfather, it would be his. He wasn't about to turn his hand against his own people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a low voice, he said, "Be careful and look closely at what I have here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his hand, showing them the dark, gleaming Dragon Ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curiosity swept through the crowd and everyone looked over curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This ring looks unusual. Is it some kind of deadly weapon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe it's a token."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could Anthony, this useless man, actually have some amazing background?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd murmured again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne, seeing the Dragon Ring on Anthony's hand, shouted furiously, "Don't be fooled! It's just an ordinary ring! He wore it before we got married, but I didn't like how it looked, so I made him take it off!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, I can't believe you're using that thing to deceive people!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone believed Anne's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd relaxed a little and then started yelling again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He had trampled on Dragon Guild's honor! Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him! Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four Dragon Guards felt a surge of pressure, but seeing Anthony so calm, they hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the ring really was an important token, there could be a serious problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, noticing they didn't recognize the Dragon Ring, smiled and said, "Your status is too low to know what this is. I don't blame you. But you should go ahead and bring Ms. Ronald out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the Dragon Guards communicated through his earpiece.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who dares to cause a ruckus outside Dragon Guild? Are you looking for trouble?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, with a stern command, a middle-aged man, flanked by the four Dragon Guards, stepped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Mr. Norris!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, Mr. Norris!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The troublemaker is this man, Anthony! He's the husband of the young lady of the Smith family, and he demands that Ms. Ronald come out to greet him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Norris, don't let him off the hook!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted in voices of accusation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne, in a fit of rage, added, "Mr. Norris, Anthony was kicked out by me! He has no connection to me or the Smith family anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can do whatever you want with him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vice Director Daniel Norris glanced at Anthony and sneered, "Demanding Ms. Ronald come out to greet you? You have quite the nerve! Who do you think you are?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony furrowed his brows and said, "Is this enough to make you understand?" He raised the Dragon Ring higher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is this?" Daniel asked, looking at the gleaming Dragon Ring with skepticism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be careful and see clearly!" Anthony snapped. Using his mental energy, he activated the ring, and a star-like diamond shimmered on its dark surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel's eyes widened in surprise. "A Dragon Ring with a star?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony smirked. "Now you understand who I am?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel chuckled darkly. "I admit, it's a fine piece of craftsmanship. If auctioned, it could fetch a decent price. But do you really think this is enough for Ms. Ronald to come out and greet you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You worthless man, are you out of your mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Daniel finished speaking, the crowd erupted in laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin grinned smugly. "I told you, this guy's just putting on a show! Mr. Norris, order his execution right here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel, staring at Anthony with contempt, sneered, "You've trampled on the dignity of Dragon Guild and spoken nonsense. Apologize now, or cut out your own tongue! Maybe we'll spare your life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he tossed a sharp dagger at Anthony's feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surrounding Dragon Guards roared in unison, "Apologize now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The murderous aura around them pressed down on Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, his voice low with anger, said, "I can understand if your status is too low for you to recognize the Dragon Ring. But I'm giving you one last chance. Immediately call for Ms. Ronald and have her come out to see me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel burst into laughter. "You pathetic fool. How dare you demand to see Ms. Ronald? In your dreams!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you don't know your position, I'll deal with you myself. Remember, it'll be an honor for you to die at my hands!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he reached out, and a gust of energy pulled the dagger up from the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon gripping the blade, Daniel's eyes burned with rage as he prepared to strike, aiming to assert his authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anthony was quicker. With a powerful kick, he sent Daniel flying backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel, a Warrior, had underestimated Anthony. He never expected Anthony to strike, let alone defeat him so easily. Now, he was seething with rage, his face flushed red with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you waiting for? Get him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tear him apart!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He roared, his eyes bloodshot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his command, eight Dragon Guards surged forward, charging at Anthony.</span></p></div>
