        <h1>Chapter 7 Anthony's Gifts</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Smith! It was Anthony! He..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy burst out, pointing frantically in the direction where Anthony had fled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anne, you're finally here! Anthony snuck into your room while you were away. He was stealing something! I caught him red-handed, and instead of apologizing, he... he attacked me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at this! Look what he did to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlet hurried over, presenting her bruises to Anne with a dramatic flourish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne replayed the security footage she'd seen earlier in her mind. Seeing Scarlet's flushed cheeks now, she could tell Scarlet was covering for Anthony. But Anne decided to let it slide. It wasn't the time to expose her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That worthless scumbag! He's gone too far this time. When I catch him, I'll skin him alive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Timothy, where did he run off to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy quickly pointed to the courtyard wall. "He just jumped over the wall and took off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Ben charged at the wall, vaulting over it with ease. Moments later, he dropped back down, looking frustrated. "Ms. Smith, all I saw was the taillight of a motorcycle. He's already gone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlet let out a quiet sigh of relief, clutching her chest as if she'd narrowly avoided disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne shot her a sharp look, a smirk tugging at her lips. "What's this? Mom, you seem awfully worried about him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Worried? Me? Don't be ridiculous!" Scarlet waved it off hastily. "Today's your big day. Don't let anything distract you. Get to the banquet hall! I'm feeling a little under the weather, so I won't be attending."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne frowned but nodded. There was no time to dwell on it. Still, the situation gnawed at her. Anthony had always been obedient, practically groveling at her feet. Why the sudden outburst?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Could it be... he's too in love with me? Maybe being cast aside was too much for him to handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, I know you care deeply for me. But this world isn't about love. It's about power. Only by marrying Alvin can I secure my place as the family's heir. You... you're just not useful to me anymore. Don't blame me for being cruel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her thoughts were interrupted by Timothy's hesitant voice. "Oh, Ms. Smith, one more </span><span>thing. Before he left, Anthony said something. He said the game has just begun. The real show is yet to come."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne sneered, "Pathetic. No matter how much he tries to stir things up, it won't change a thing. He's powerless, a nobody. We're from completely different worlds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ben, leave a team here to tighten security. The rest of you, come with me. We're heading back to the banquet hall!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whatever Anthony was plotting would have to wait. Her engagement with Alvin was the key to cementing the alliance between the Smith and Blake families. That was the real event of the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne couldn't deny that, in terms of looks and charisma, Alvin fell short of Anthony. But Alvin was the heir to the illustrious Blake family, and that alone made him far superior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her decision was the right one. It had to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the shadows of a dimly lit alley, Anthony weaved through the narrow streets on his roaring Hellfire Bike, his eyes locked on his destination, the Smith family's hotel banquet hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beating up Anne's stepmother and teaching those arrogant bodyguards a lesson was just the warm-up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The real targets of his revenge were Alvin and Anne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tonight, he would tear off their carefully crafted masks in front of all their esteemed guests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chaos he'd caused at the Smith Manor was a calculated move to lure Anne away from the banquet. Now, with the banquet hall left vulnerable, he had the perfect opportunity to slip in and set his plan into motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne made her way back to the banquet hall, surrounded by Ben and a small army of bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, Alvin and the representatives of the Blake family were already waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anne, I heard Anthony stirred up trouble while you were away," Alvin said, taking her hand with a smirk. "You didn't actually kill him, did you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's smile was strained. "He ran off the moment he heard I was coming back, scurried off like a rat. Alvin, let's focus on the engagement for now. We can deal with him properly later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin's eyes narrowed, his voice filled with irritation. "What a shame. I was hoping to drag him here and make him watch us get engaged."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne laughed lightly, the sound tinged with confidence. "Don't worry. Once we're officially engaged, we'll issue a joint bounty under both families. He won't get far."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the engagement ceremony began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne and Alvin walked onto the stage arm in arm, basking in the adoration and applause of the gathered guests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One congratulation after another poured in, and their smiles grew broader with each passing moment. The sheer value of the gifts they'd received was staggering, easily worth hundreds of millions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every person in the room represented an alliance, a connection, or a subordinate of their powerful families. From this day forward, Anne and Alvin would be at the center </span><span>of it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was their moment, the dawn of their reign.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the celebration reached its peak, a voice cut through the air like a knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, congratulations! I've got gifts for you too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd whipped around, stunned. At the doorway stood a man in a sinister ghost mask. With a deliberate motion, Anthony pulled it off, revealing his sharp, handsome face.</span></p></div>
