        <h1>Chapter 168 Traitor</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like a towering mountain, Malakar stood there, an awe-inspiring and terrifying presence. His longsword in his massive hand grew even larger in that instant, extending well over 10 feet in length.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Vincent cheered, Malakar swung his gigantic sword in a sweeping motion, bringing it crashing down through the air. The blade, white as freshly fallen snow, gleamed faintly with a crimson glow just as it descended&mdash;a strange and eerie sight. The sword sliced through the air with a deafening roar, sending waves of sword energy in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's heart skipped a beat at the sight. She couldn't afford to underestimate him anymore. Drawing on the full force of her elemental power, she unleashed it with reckless intensity. A fierce wind then howled to life, kicking up clouds of golden sands that filled the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the steep cliffside, the wind surged, dragging the sand along with it in a powerful, swirling storm that descended from above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a blink, the sand coalesced into an enormous sword&mdash;easily 32 feet long&mdash;that came crashing down with devastating force toward the towering Malakar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent turned to see the colossal blade cutting through the sky and was completely dumbfounded. "Holy shit..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought in disbelief, "A sword as big as Malakar himself? Compared to that, Malakar doesn't even seem that terrifying anymore. What kind of crazy power is this?" As the massive blade slammed down, he stood frozen in shock&mdash;until a deafening crash brought him back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unwilling to back down, Malakar raised his colossal sword to meet the sandy behemoth. When the two swords collided, an explosive burst of energy erupted, shaking the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the sand sword didn't disintegrate. Instead, it seemed to devour Malakar's blade, unleashing an overwhelming torrent of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a low, thunderous rumble, the impact drove him backward, step by step. Each footfall left a jagged, unsettling imprint </span><span>on</span><span> the asphalt. It wasn't until he had taken several steps that the power of the sandy sword began to fade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malakar had endured the attack, but the road beneath him couldn't take the strain. With a final, thunderous step, the pavement gave way. The ground cracked apart and collapsed, creating a massive chasm that quickly began to spread toward the cliff's edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Malakar yelled, panic flashing across his face. As the ground beneath him crumbled, his massive frame leaped into the air just in time. He wasn't about to mess around&mdash;beneath him was a cliff thousands of feet high, and even with his formidable defenses, that fall would shatter him to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Carolyn had anticipated this. The moment Malakar jumped, a torrent of sand surged toward him once again&mdash;this time, with unrelenting speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sand moved like a swarm of locusts, and as it approached, it coalesced into three swords, each over three feet long. The blades hurtled through the air, aimed directly at his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Bitch</span><span>!" He cursed. Suspended mid-air, he had nowhere to dodge. In his panic, a strange crimson barrier flared to life around him, pulsing with an unsettling glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom&mdash;boom&mdash;boom! The massive sword slammed into the crimson barrier surrounding Malakar. The red glow shimmered and wavered before exploding with a resounding pop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the barrier had diminished much of the sword's destructive force, the residual energy still hurled him over a hundred feet away</span><span>,</span><span> leaving him tumbling through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he finally managed to stabilize himself, blood gushed from his mouth. He spat it out with a grimace, the crimson splatter staining the ground beneath him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just one strike, Carolyn had broken through Malakar's powerful defenses. </span><span>T</span><span>he force of this blow was so overwhelming that Anthony would have been completely taken aback if he'd seen it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Malakar coughed up a mouthful of blood, his massive, mountain-like frame shrank rapidly, returning to its normal size.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent was stunned, completely dumbfounded. "What on earth..." Carolyn's overwhelming strength had far exceeded his expectations. Even so, he still had one final ace up his sleeve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he was strategizing, Sergio suddenly appeared around the bend of the mountain path, leading a group of men back. "Ms. Carolyn Turner, Ms. Turner! Are you alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine," Carolyn replied, ready to press the advantage. However, she paused as Sergio approached and asked, "What about you all? Are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sergio nodded. "We're fine</span><span>,</span><span> too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn breathed a sigh of relief and said, "Good to hear. Go protect Ms. Turner and capture Vincent. I'll take care of Malakar&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was giving orders when, in the distance, Malakar unexpectedly stood back up with a resounding boom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sweeping motion of his massive hand, a sword light sliced through the air at an alarming speed, so fast that Carolyn's </span><span>mind went blank for a while</span><span>. She couldn't help but wonder, "He still has this much fight left in him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no time to hesitate. Carolyn moved swiftly, and with a wave of her hands, sand rose from the ground 32 feet away, swirling into a golden haze&mdash;whoosh! The sand quickly gathered, forming a towering sand wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wall was still forming when a glint of cold steel flashed to Rose's side. A sharp, deadly dagger came hurtling toward her neck. She knew immediately that this wasn't good at all. Instinct kicked in, and she tilted her head just in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thud&mdash;the cold blade buried itself in Rose's shoulder, sending a searing wave of pain through her body. But her evasive maneuver had disrupted Carolyn's focus&mdash;the half-formed sand wall collapsed in an instant, scattering into a cloud of fine dust that fell silently to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Worse yet, with the sand dissipated, the massive sword light came barreling forward, unstoppable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Rose, watch out!" Carolyn shouted. Ignoring the dagger in Sergio's hand, she whirled and threw herself in front of Rose, making herself a human shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of this happened in the blink of an eye, faster than anyone could react. The sword light struck with devastating force. Carolyn let out a muffled grunt, her body trembling violently as a mouthful of blood spewed from her lips, staining Rose's purple dress crimson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Carolyn's eyes burned with fury as she glared at Sergio. "You traitor!" The impact sent her flying backward with Rose in her arms, the sheer force leaving her body battered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even as they fell, Carolyn managed to lash out with her palm, striking toward Sergio. Unfortunately, he had anticipated her counterattack and darted away the moment his blade struck, disappearing into the distance.</span></p></div>
