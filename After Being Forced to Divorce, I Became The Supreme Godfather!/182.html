        <h1>Chapter 181 Prison Break</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aaron! Stay on his tail! No need to engage. Just keep me posted on his location!" Vincent shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A convoy of SUVs tore away from the Turner family mines, racing toward Crimson Canyon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent was practically buzzing with excitement. This time, Anthony had nowhere to run. The </span><span>Virstino</span><span> Mountains were their turf. Besides, with Anthony injured and The Four Demon Lords by Vincent's side, how far could he possibly get?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Vincent Turner!" Arthur's voice came through clearly. "He's heading south, but... but I'm losing ground, sir."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aaron! Time to die!" Suddenly, Anthony's battle cry burst through the earpiece.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive explosion followed, along with the sharp crack of breaking metal. The radio crackled with static, then went dead silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aaron? What's going on? Answer me, damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After several attempts to reach Aaron with no response, Vincent barked out orders, "Step on it! Aaron must've been ambushed! That worthless Anthony is always playing dirty. When I get my hands on him, he's dead meat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Vincent couldn't have guessed what was really happening south of the mines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur was there alone, playing both parts in an elaborate deception. He'd smashed his head against the cliff face, leaving himself bloodied and broken, destroying his </span><span>earpiece in the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he'd charged forward, deliberately leaving signs of a fierce struggle all around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After running several miles, he pulled out a knife and slashed his own chest, letting the blood flow freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slammed himself against the cliff one last time, knocking himself unconscious in a pool of his own blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony was nowhere to be found.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in the secret chamber at the Turner family mines, Sergio couldn't hide his smug satisfaction. "Don't take this personally, Ms. Carolyn Turner," he sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sometimes you have to go where the opportunities are. It's just the way it is, and I didn't have a choice. All these years</span><span>,</span><span> I've worked my ass off for the Turner family and showed nothing but loyalty. But I was always second fiddle to Dariel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's he got that I don't? Just because you favored him? What makes him so special? Since you chose him over me, I had to look out for myself, right? Can you really blame me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sergio lounged back in his chair with his legs crossed, looking smug as hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither Carolyn nor Rose bothered to respond to his taunts. Their eyes stayed glued to the now-quiet screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The footage no longer showed Anthony or Arthur, but their faces were a mix of worry and desperate hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were terrified for Anthony's safety, yet still clinging to the slim chance that he might somehow pull through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, though, they knew the odds were stacked against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what felt like forever, Vincent's convoy blazed across the screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hah!" Sergio stretched out in his chair, basking in his moment of triumph. "You can stop watching now. Anthony's as good as dead." He smirked. "Take my advice. Stop being so damn stubborn about believing in Anthony."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Face it. </span><span>H</span><span>e's no savior of the Turner family, and he's never </span><span>gonna</span><span> get the chance to rescue you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish his gloating, the vault door exploded inward with a loud bang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The steel door, built like a tank, went flying a good fifty feet before slamming into the far wall&mdash;with one of the guards still on it, turning him into a bloody mess!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blast of air whipped past Sergio, making his hair fly wild and nearly knocking him and his chair flat on their backs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force was so intense that it sent the steel door flying like a missile!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell are you?" Sergio roared. "Got a death wish?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sergio jumped to his feet in shock, whirling toward the doorway with a furious shout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A figure burst through the entrance, moving so fast it left afterimages in its wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sergio's blood ran cold as he recognized the intruder. "Anthony? What the&mdash; How the fuck is this possible?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony&mdash; Aunt Carolyn, Anthony's here!" Rose screamed out with tears of joy, her voice trembling with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sergio!" Anthony charged in like a raging bull, his voice thundering through the room. "You backstabbing piece of shit! Your time's up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh fuck!" Sergio nearly jumped out of his skin. Without missing a beat, he grabbed his chair and hurled it at Anthony. Then, too terrified to even think about fighting, he turned tail and ran.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No way in hell was he sticking around for this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sergio was just a bodyguard who knew some basic fighting moves. He didn't even qualify as a Warrior!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, on the other hand, was the real deal&mdash;a full-fledged Warrior and Metahuman who had proven his incredible power time and time again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Sergio didn't stand a chance against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap in their abilities was just too massive. Before Sergio could even turn around, before the chair in his hands could come down, Anthony's kick sent him flying across the room!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh!" Blood spurted from Sergio's mouth before he even hit the ground. His body slammed hard into the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he crumpled to the floor, blood gushed from his mouth as his life slipped away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony wasn't about to show mercy to a backstabbing traitor like him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking out Sergio with that single kick, Anthony made quick work of the rest of the black-clad men in the secret chamber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Rose? Ms. Carolyn Turner?" Anthony called out as he broke open the cage with one swift strike, freeing both women from their prison.</span></p></div>
