        <h1>Chapter 94 Valiance</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just twenty minutes, Anthony, who was seriously injured, had already recovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the main gate, Mason, who was sitting on a stone healing, felt very confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had only recovered, it would be fine. But Anthony was extremely fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rushed out, unstoppable, wielding Dragonfang and single-handedly caused more than a dozen werewolves to die in howls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He relied solely on brute strength to repel the army of werewolves that were about to rush through the gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason and the howling army of werewolves were both stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the onlookers, Anne was also shocked, and Alvin was already beyond </span><span>stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's prowess shocked everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to these two, the gathered crowd stared at Anthony with even more surprise, fear, helplessness, and confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This battle had many ups and downs, and their emotions were more thrilling than a roller coaster ride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their previous submission was purely out of necessity, a temporary measure to save their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, they sincerely hoped that Anthony could repel the ferocious werewolf army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because, as long as he repelled the werewolf army, they wouldn't have to join the Evil Spirit Legion or give up all their possessions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, the unpredictable battle left them in a state of shock and at a loss for what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, these people were at a loss for words for a moment and chose to remain silent, observing the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He must have taken more drugs!" They remained silent, but Anne glared with fury and shouted, "Otherwise, how could he recover so quickly? Damn it! How is this drug-dependent loser still not dead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others were anxious, and in truth, Anne was no different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she hoped that Anthony would die and that the werewolf army would raze the Turner Manor to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this way, she could fully leverage the power of the Evil Spirit Legion to unify Yoland and become its dominant ruler!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's right! Everyone, don't worry." Alvin hesitated slightly before adding, "He must have taken more drugs; otherwise, he would have died long ago!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, with such frequent drug use over such a short period, he won't last much longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if Mr. Foster doesn't kill him, he will die from his bloodline fracturing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's doomed; even God can't save him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, Alvin misunderstood everyone's thoughts, thinking that they, like him, were eager to join the Evil Spirit Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, upon hearing him say this, the others also felt that hope was very slim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Relying on drugs to activate superpowers, regardless of the strength, this is entirely a way of fighting that burns one's life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stronger the burst of power, the stronger the backlash from the drug effects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From this perspective, Alvin was right; Anthony wouldn't live much longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"kill!" "Mr. Johnson is mighty! Brothers, kill..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guys, let's rush together to kill all these beasts..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While everyone was preoccupied with their own thoughts, not far away, Anthony's heroic actions greatly boosted the morale of the Turner Guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of people fought desperately, forcing the werewolf army to retreat from the second checkpoint to the first one!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the werewolves entered the range of machine guns and cannons, accompanied by a </span><span>dull rumble, the werewolves outside the gate were once again plunged into chaos and death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation turned around, and the Turner Guards also entered a frenzied state. Unconsciously, they pursued the enemy beyond the gate, showing a determined stance to press their advantage and wipe out the werewolf army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they numbered only in the dozens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, although the werewolf army was forced to retreat, their casualties were not significant, and they still numbered nearly a hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! Don't rush out! Get back and defend the gate!" Anthony was shocked and rushed to the front of the crowd, stopping these irrational people from advancing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they dared to rush out, they would surely be surrounded by the wolf pack and torn apart!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, if they guarded the gate, with the support of the firepower near the gate and the advantage of its narrowness, they could still defend for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they rushed out, none of them would survive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's shout instantly sobered up the Turner Guards, who quickly retreated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the crowd retreated, Anthony held Dragonfang and stood at the forefront of the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A gust of wind swept through, carrying with it swirling yellow sand, making Anthony's figure appear inexplicably majestic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, he was facing over a hundred werewolves baring their fangs and eyes glinting with menace. They were ready to pounce at any moment and tear Anthony to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony squinted his eyes and instinctively tried to grip Dragonfang tighter, but his arm couldn't stop trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Anthony's legs were also trembling uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that he was afraid; rather, he was struggling to hold on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strength was once again depleted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason he could still stand despite his exhaustion was purely due to his willpower, gritting his teeth to endure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pungent smell of blood surged into his nostrils and mouth. Anthony gritted his teeth and forced the blood back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't spit out the blood, retreat, or even fall down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason said, "You're such a fighter..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony stood proudly, and Mason jumped down from the boulder, holding a long knife, a cold smile spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Mason approached, the long sword in his hand glinting with a cold light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes, a deep emerald green, also glinted with a bloodthirsty gleam.</span></p></div>
