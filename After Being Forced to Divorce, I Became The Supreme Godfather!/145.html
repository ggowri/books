        <h1>Chapter 144 Hide</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur's analysis made Anne worry, because he was right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne hesitated because she was not sure. Anthony was too strong and powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Anne was unusually smart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because she could see that when Anthony defeated Ben, he looked very relaxed, which meant that his strength was far greater than Ben's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that was the case, the Black Cloak might lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, she went to Arthur, intending to pretend to be calm and ask him a few questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Arthur saw through her thoughts and analyzed them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected of being the leader of the Zodiac, Aaron was not only powerful, but also smart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was calm and collected!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne was shocked and moved. A man with both martial skills and wisdom like Arthur was her dream lover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin was just a premature ejaculator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief thought, Anne smiled, "Mr. Hastings, you are so smart. I admire you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think Anthony's chances are?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While asking, Anne picked up the red wine bottle, poured a glass of wine for Arthur, and also threw him a wink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne believed that with her stunning beauty, no man could resist her seduction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin was immediately attracted to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought she could conquer Arthur quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Arthur pretended not to see it and said calmly, "At least seventy percent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne froze, not because of his answer but of his reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't react to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne thought, "Is Arthur playing hard to get?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Anne could think about it, Alvin snorted and walked over, saying unhappily, "Mr. Hastings, aren't you being pessimistic?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony is just a piece of trash, but he has a chance of defeating the Black Cloak? Nonsense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin's dissatisfaction was not only due to Arthur's words, but also because of Anne's attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "This bitch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She actually fawned on Arthur over and over again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur was not angry about this, but still looked unruly and said, "It seems to be true at the moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he looked at the battle outside the gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony threw a punch, knocking the Black Cloak back three feet. The Black Cloak staggered and almost lost his balance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony took three steps back and easily steadied his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obvious that this time, Anthony had the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin was not panicked at all. He sneered, "Mr. Hastings, don't you think that the Blake family's Shadow Sentinel has only this ability?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To tell you the truth, the Black Cloak is a Level B Warrior!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur didn't react at all, but Anne couldn't help but be shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Cloak was a Level B Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know about that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that Anne was not the only one who deliberately hid her strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne had kept Ben's breakthrough a secret from Alvin before, but now, Alvin told her that the Black Cloak was a Level B Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Anne's dissatisfaction, Alvin explained helplessly, "I did not want to hide it from you, but the Black Cloak just broke through not long ago. My family only told me this morning, and I didn't have time to tell you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what, the main contact of the Evil Spirit Legion was still Anne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the Evil Spirit Legion only recognized her. Therefore, even if Alvin was dissatisfied, he dared not turn against Anne for the time being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Cloak's breakthrough did happen recently, but he didn't know about it today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, Alvin was hiding something from Anne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne concealed Ben's breakthrough in order to attract the attention of the Evil Spirit Legion, and Alvin did the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alvin was more cunning. He wanted to surpass Anne with the strength of the Black Cloak and win the favor of the Evil Spirit Legion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because the strength of the Blake family far exceeded that of the Smith family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before this, in terms of status and influence, the Smith family was far inferior to the Blake family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Alvin was dissatisfied and thought, "Why could Anne control everything after the Evil Spirit Legion appeared?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Level B Warrior?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur pretended to be surprised and said, "If that's the case, Anthony has no chance </span><span>of winning..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin sneered and said arrogantly, "He must die today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur said nothing more. Instead, he turned his head and looked outside the gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the gate, after more than a dozen rounds of fighting, the area within one hundred feet was in ruins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the Black Cloak vomited blood and flew more than forty feet away, looking miserable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne and Alvin also looked back, and their faces changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Cloak was said to be a Level B Warrior and sure to win.</span></p></div>
