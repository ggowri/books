        <h1>Chapter 55 Master of the Realm</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the critical moment, Devil Eye awakened and gave Anthony a direct command, "Follow my instructions. Prepare to run."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A feeling of joy surged in Anthony's heart. Indeed, he had not been wrong, and Devil Eye would not abandon him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that the brief dormancy of Devil Eye earlier was to accumulate power so it could exert its maximum effect at the crucial moment to save his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But leaving now? Anthony wasn't ready to give up so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he hesitated, voices erupted from within the manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! Ms. Carolyn Turner, you mustn't! Call it off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice was unmistakable to Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Anthony saw a red figure rushing towards him. It was none other than Rose's personal maid, Helen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Helen was like spotting a lifeline. They had faced life and death together, and her arrival could only mean that she was here on Rose's behalf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen rushed forward, placing herself between Anthony and the imminent danger. Raising her face to the manor, she pleaded, "Ms. Carolyn Turner, Ms. Turner is aware of everything. She says your betrayal, framing Anthony as the culprit, has left her too </span><span>ashamed to continue living.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you refuse to repent and insist on killing Anthony, she vows to end her own life as atonement for his suffering."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's heart warmed at Helen's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose's loyalty made everything he had endured worthwhile. Even if he were to die here and now, he felt at peace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deep sigh echoed from the manor, and the yellow sand blade hovering above Anthony's head scattered into the wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grains of sand rained down, covering him from head to toe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anthony knew the storm had passed. Carolyn would no longer kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You silly girl. Everything I've done is for your sake. With your unique position, how can you allow yourself to fall for this penniless outcast?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With your softness and hesitation, how will you ever lead the Turner family and inherit its legacy...?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn muttered to herself, and in her disappointment, she spoke the words that were on her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd looked on in stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose had truly developed feelings for Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought back to the scene at the Dragon Guild when Anthony had held Rose, and she had kissed him on the cheek. A noble heiress and a destitute man, it was an inconceivable pairing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing her slip, Carolyn quickly shifted the topic. With a cold snort, she said, "I'm sparing you, not because of anyone's pleas, but because of your claim. You say you can find the true culprit. Is that true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony answered confidently, "Ms. Carolyn Turner, let's make a deal. If I can uncover the real mastermind behind the attack before this banquet ends, ensuring the Turner family's safety, you'll stay out of my and Ms. Turner's business from now on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn scoffed. "Dream on! The Evil Spirit Legion is a professional assassin guild. They've survived this long because of their ironclad secrecy. They'd never reveal their employer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And if you fail?" she added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll accept whatever punishment you see fit," Anthony declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine!" Carolyn's voice rang out across the manor. "Let's settle this. If you succeed, I won't interfere with you and Rose. If you fail, you'll kneel before her and take your own life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deal!" Anthony replied firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Carolyn addressed the manor, her voice commanding. "The Turner family is honored to celebrate Rose's 20th birthday. Doors open, welcome our esteemed guests."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel approached Anthony, visibly moved. "Mr. Johnson, please, this way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deadly standoff had ended. Anthony could hardly believe that simply entering Turner Manor's gates had brought him to the brink of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His steps felt unsteady as if he were waking from a terrible nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, you look exhausted. Let me help you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen, who had once been cold toward Anthony, was now remarkably gentle. Supporting his arm, she led him inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dariel personally accompanied them, with guards trailing closely behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This display left Anne and the others fuming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Helen was only a maid, she represented Rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By personally assisting Anthony, it was as if Rose herself had extended her hand to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They helplessly watched as Anthony crossed the threshold of the Turner Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. He won't make it through the day," Alvin snarled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Evil Spirit Legion is so terrifying. How can he find the real culprit? If he can't find the killer, Ms. Carolyn Turner won't let him off!" Alvin said with a menacing tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne nodded and said, "To put it simply, he's still gambling. Only someone powerless like him, with nothing to lose, would believe that he can win over Ms. Turner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the other family representatives also looked down on Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They believed he was just stalling for time, and there was no way he could find the true culprit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I bet he's just looking for a chance to meet Ms. Turner. He knows Ms. Carolyn Turner is kind-hearted and will definitely save him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, stop dreaming! Ms. Carolyn Turner will never let you off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone shouted at Anthony's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony heard all the discussions but didn't bother to respond. He walked into Turner Manor, captivated by the grandeur and beauty of the estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, this was the life of the elite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, Anthony felt as though a vast, limitless world had unfurled before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he believed he would be its master.</span></p></div>
