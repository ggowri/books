        <h1>Chapter 124 Level B Expert</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph was incredibly efficient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time Anthony had finished discussing the details of the procedure with Arthur, she was already prepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scar removal surgery would be performed entirely by machines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the procedure was scheduled, Seraph invited Anthony to the bar next door once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Anthony strolled in with confidence, a glass of red wine in hand, and casually settled himself on a plush sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Seraph giggled, swaying her graceful figure as she walked over. "Mr. Johnson," she teased, "you're becoming more and more manly. What am I to do now that I'm starting to like you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Seraph perched herself affectionately on Anthony's lap, her full hips pressing against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She also draped an arm around his neck, her movements suggestive and intimate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's lips curved into a smirk as he reached out with his free hand, running it along her curves. "In that case, why don't you slip out of that synthetic dress?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'd be more than happy to show you what a real man is like," he said with a hint of swagger in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With such a beautiful woman presenting herself, Anthony wasn't about to play coy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, his hands didn't hesitate. One moved from her hips to her thighs, lifting the sheer fabric of her dress before sliding underneath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His skin was smooth and supple, with an irresistible softness that made it impossible to pull away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph didn't resist. Instead, she parted her legs slightly, leaning closer to Anthony, and whispered, "Mr. Johnson, you must be joking. I'm not wearing anything underneath today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's movements paused for a moment, and then he pressed forward more deliberately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a sharp pain pricked his finger as if he had accidentally touched a thorn on a rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony smirked inwardly,&nbsp;"Little temptress!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, his hand didn't stop. Instead, it ventured deeper, brushing against her skin with deliberate intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, without warning, he grabbed Seraph's thigh firmly, kneading it with force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph let out a startled cry, hopping up slightly as she pouted, "Mr. Johnson, you're so mean..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony let out a cold chuckle, raising an eyebrow as he looked at her. "Little temptress, do you dare play tricks on me again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh no..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph stomped her foot, her voice soft and pleading. "I was wrong, okay? I won't do it again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come here. Sit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony swirled his wine glass, patting his lap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph gave him a sulky look but obediently stepped closer. Lightly, she perched herself on Anthony's lap, her movements delicate and submissive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While stroking his smooth thigh, Anthony asked, "The second task of the Chosen Path is complete. Are there no additional rewards?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked this, knowing full well that if there were rewards, they certainly wouldn't be Seraph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because, in a way, Seraph was already his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he was actually quite curious about what Godfather might offer as a reward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nope..." Seraph shrugged, wrapping her arms around Anthony's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, after Mr. Johnson completed the task, didn't the Dragon Ring already provide a reward?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Johnson, you can't be this greedy," she teased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony looked a bit disappointed, but she wasn't wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reward from the Dragon Ring had indeed been more than generous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They chatted for a while until Arthur's surgery was complete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Arthur emerged from the operating room, Anthony was momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, Arthur's features had been grotesque due to his scars, almost impossible to look at directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with the wounds removed, his features were surprisingly defined. While not precisely handsome, he was undoubtedly attractive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The transformation was a success, and Arthur was overwhelmed with excitement and gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur didn't stay long. After a brief greeting, he led the Zodiac members to prepare the Draconic Shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Johnson..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seraph approached with a seductive look as soon as Arthur left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost!" Anthony shoved her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to train!" he declared, pinching her rear firmly and ordering, "Go find me a suitable training location."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ouch!" Seraph whined, "Please be gentler, Mr. Johnson... you're so mean..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celestial Palace was nestled on a mountainside, surrounded by lush trees with an incredibly dense spiritual energy, making it the perfect place for cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was why Anthony had come to Celestial Palace to train.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle with the Turner family had once again driven home the critical importance of strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, thanks to his symbiotic bond with Rose, Devil Eye had evolved, and his power had increased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what if Rose hadn't been there? He would have been in serious trouble!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The root of the problem was simple. He just wasn't strong enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Devil Eye?" he muttered to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What level of power do I currently possess?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting cross-legged, Anthony summoned Devil Eye from his consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Level B Warrior, Level B Metahuman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost without delay, Devil Eye provided the answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level B?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he activated Devil Eye and fought with all his might, he could probably take on a Level C Warrior or a Level C Metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Devil Eye's duration was limited, and Arthur had mentioned that the Evil Spirit Legion included many Level C and even Level D Metahumans!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enemy was formidable, and Anthony dared not underestimate them!</span></p></div>
