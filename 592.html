  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lance's exclamation caused everyone in the Augustine family to stare at the six people in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godsons?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The foreign divine families will select the most powerful young generation as the Godsons! However, the selection is not done by the families themselves but by the government.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In a powerful country, only up to 20 people can become Godsons! In other words, each of them ranks among the top 20 in strength within their country's younger generation!" someone exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Vincent grew serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are all six of them Godsons from Yalynch?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lance nodded. "Yes, they are all Godsons from Yalynch! Look at the logo on their cuff. It's the Sword of Victory. Only Godsons in foreign countries have this emblem embroidered on their cuffs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The golden Sword of Victory signifies they are among the top three Godsons. The silver one represents the top ten, while the bronze one indicates the top twenty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"On the cuffs of the six, two bear the silver Sword of Victory, while the other four have the bronze ones. This means at least two of them are among the top ten strongest in the younger generation of Yalynch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Lance had finished speaking, everyone frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder they are so confident!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Emma said coldly, "So what if they are Godsons? As the younger generation of the Augustine family, even without the title of Godsons, we are not weaker than any of them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will fight them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she stared at the six people icily and aggressively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen put on a long face, but seeing she had already stood up, he quickly followed suit and declared, "That's right! So what if they are Godsons from Yalynch? If there are Godsons in Rosmandi, I will also be one as well!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will fight them, too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He peeked at Godfather, hoping to catch a hint of approval on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, he was disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather remained calm and expressionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Lance took a deep breath. "As the prospective heir to the Augustine family, I naturally have to fight! It's a pity that I left Yalynch too early. Otherwise, I could also compete for the title of Godson there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, it's not bad to be able to battle against the Godsons from Yalynch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Sam suddenly emerged from the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to fight, too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am eager to battle against the powerful Godsons from Yalynch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, four people were willing to take up the challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were essentially four of the five strongest members of the Augustine family's younger generation, under thirty-five, with their strength reaching Class AA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent and Matthew were ineligible to participate in the battle due to their age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett glanced at the four people with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do only four members of the Augustine family dare to fight? You're still short by two. Is no one else willing to step up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather's eyes swept over everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked at each other in fear, and silence fell. Many of the younger generations were conflicted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wanted to fight and impress Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the opponents were the Godsons from Yalynch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew that below Class AA, they were no match for the Godsons from Yalynch. If they forced themselves to fight on behalf of the Augustine family, it would be a shame for them to perform poorly and embarrass themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, no one spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? Is there no talent left in the younger generation of the Augustine family? You can't even get six masters under thirty-five?" Everett taunted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma immediately flew into a rage and sneered, "Why are you in such a hurry? This is a round-robin battle. It might take only four of us to overcome all six of the Godsons!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't waste time. Let's fight now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A powerful aura erupted from her, signaling that she would be the first challenger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather stared at her approvingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Owen saw this, his face suddenly darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swiftly said, "Emma, you're too young for this. Step back and let me handle it first to gauge their strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He forced his way in front of Emma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She frowned. "Can you do it? Don't lose! The first round is very important for morale. You must win."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen retorted coldly, "Of course. Since I dare to strike first, a win is assured! I will secure a decisive victory for the Augustine family in the opening round!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will even defeat all six Godsons!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was proud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still peeked at Godfather, hoping to impress him with his aggressiveness and earn his approval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, he was disappointed again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather said calmly, "Everett, let's start the fight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone immediately made their way, leaving Arena Number One for the next battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen stood in the center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pointed at the six Godsons from Yalynch and asked arrogantly, "Which one of you will challenge me first? Remember my name. I'm Owen Augustine, the heir-to-be to the Augustine family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Show me your strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come on!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
