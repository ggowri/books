  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dissolving Light was powerful enough to pierce through enemies, but it didn't significantly enhance Osborne's strength. The light of Redemption was different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It could instantly restore his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter if he was seriously injured, in a negative state, or even exhausted, as long as he used the Light of Redemption, his condition could be instantly restored to normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it could only be used once every half hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, Osborne would truly be immortal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite this limitation, the Light of Redemption was incredibly potent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, Osborne prioritized mastering the light elemental power. The dark elemental power would improve his stealth and make his sneak attacks with the Goddess of Grain's scythe nearly unbeatable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By deepening his understanding of dark power, he aimed to become a top dark killer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, he also wanted to practice the dark power in depth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne also recognized the importance of spatial power, which he relied on for escape. He will not give up no matter what. After learning space stretching and folding, he knew its potential in combat was immense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only pity was that the use of spatial power consumed too much spiritual energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regarding thunder and psychic power, his spiritual energy was rapidly increasing, making him competitive with others at the same level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt no need for further cultivation in this area, especially with the Death Sickle at his disposal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already mastered the intermediate use of Thunder Explosion, which was powerful but time-consuming and easily countered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly reviewed the situation of his main power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The most important thing for me now is to improve my spatial power! It's the basis of my survival. If my spatial power is strong enough, let alone the Class AAA Duke Medusa, even if I encounter a Class S Supreme Overlord, I will have a chance to escape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I must improve my spatial power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least, I need to master the intermediate application of spatial power, spatial collapse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Its power will be stronger than thunder explosion, and the attack will be </span><span>more strange and difficult</span><span> to defend and dodge! Even Duke Medusa may not be able to withstand it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination, Osborne began studying Spatial Collapse, seeking a deeper connection with space to understand its essence and uncover the secrets of space collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more he comprehended spatial, the better he could control its power, reducing energy consumption while increasing effectiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time that Osborne was so immersed in feeling the spatial power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, he gained more understanding in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His understanding of spatial power became clearer and more profound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he sensed a unique collapsing energy within space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's it!" Osborne </span><span>exclaimed,</span><span> his eyes full of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> this is the Spatial Collapse. Collapse is not tearing, nor is its disappearance, but it is like a dam bursting, an instant burst of power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When this energy reached a peak, it resulted in an inward collapse, which was even more formidable than an outward explosion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With newfound clarity, Osborne extended his hand and pointed in a direction, murmuring, "Spatial, collapse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then clenched his fist violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Buzz!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, several dozen yards from Osborne, an area of several dozen yards in radius suddenly shook. And then everything in this space, including the entire space, collapsed instantly into a singularity invisible to the naked eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything was gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying force crushed everything in the space into a singularity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Osborne couldn't help but his eyes twitching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Incredible! If the enemy is in a collapsing space, no matter how strong the defense is, it will probably be destroyed in the face of such a force!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even Duke Medusa couldn't survive at the center of such a Spatial Collapse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The only way is to quickly escape from the range of Spatial Collapse. The range of space I can collapse now is about 98 feet in radius, but only the 16 feet range in the center has the most lethal effects to kill Class AAA enemies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is already terrifying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt immensely satisfied with his progress.</span></p><div class="pagination">
