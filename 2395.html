  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Valentino activated the Starry Eye, and instantly, the world before him changed. Although it couldn't directly see through the depths of the volcano like Osborne's Satan's </span><span>Eye, he could spot the treasures hidden deep within the volcano, radiating stronger energy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under such circumstances, Valentino quickly confirmed that there was no Dark Mandala in this volcano.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wasted no time and immediately headed to the second volcano.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the other side, Brenda was just as quick. Her Golden Dragon Eye had a similar effect to Valentino's Starry Eye, allowing her to spot treasures with dense energy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The energy contained in the Dark Mandala would undoubtedly be denser than the surrounding environment. As long as there was a Dark Mandala, they would surely find it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, if it wasn't the Dark Mandala but another object with dense energy, it would also be noticed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If such a situation occurred, they would have to go deep into the volcano to check. After confirming it wasn't the Dark Mandala, they would continue searching the next volcano.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their speed was definitely much slower than Osborne's, but still very fast.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two of them, as if competing, quickly searched one volcano after another.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the vast, endless desert on the west side of Abyssal Planet, Leroy and Clara split up and began searching for Bloody Ivy separately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bloody Ivy was hidden in the desert, and the best way to find it was to wait for Bloody Ivy to appear and attack them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Bloody Ivy was quite powerful, comparable to an ordinary Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King. If there was only one or two, it would be fine, but if a whole patch of Bloody Ivy attacked together, even Leroy and Clara together would be in danger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two were not chasing results, so they were very steady.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They only hoped to get through these ten days smoothly, and if they could bring back some Bloody Ivy to exchange for Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>, that would be even better.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a thousand contestants had completely dispersed across Abyssal Planet, employing their own methods to search for various resources and treasures.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Crescentia, billions of spectators were now looking up at the projection in the sky, discussing the ongoing competition.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Brenda actually fused with the Golden Dragon Eye!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The effect of the Golden Dragon Eye is no less impressive than Valentino's Starry Eye. In fact, Brenda probably fused with the Golden Dragon Eye long ago, and her control over it is definitely better than Valentino's!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now I think Brenda's chances of winning the championship are even higher!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not necessarily. It still depends on luck."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Valentino's luck is clearly better than Brenda's. He has already found a Dark Mandala and is temporarily ahead of Brenda! One Dark Mandala can be exchanged for a million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is basically like picking up money! Too bad I wasn't strong enough and got eliminated during the state duel..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Look, Dustin and Mckinley have also arrived in the volcano area! They actually each have their own methods to quickly search for treasures..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They truly deserve to be the championship favorites!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Unfortunately, the number of Dark Mandalas in the volcanic area seems to be very limited. Apart from Valentino, no one else has found a Dark Mandala yet! Meanwhile, others have already made their own gains!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jordan has already found over a dozen Bloody Ivies. One Bloody Ivy can be exchanged for 5,000 Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>, and over a dozen of them add up to nearly 100,000 Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Regis found a patch of Ethereal Blooms, at least a hundred of them, worth over a hundred thousand Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Keeley is even luckier; he actually found an Abyssal Bone with mid Empyrean Sacredness, worth 300,000 Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Someone even found an Abyssal Snake's nest and obtained a pair of Abyssal Snake Sloughs, which can be exchanged for nearly a million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd watched the projections and kept discussing. Contestants who had a chance to make it into the top ten were followed by referees, with their actions projected live</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>except for Osborne, whose figure was nowhere to be seen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, someone finally noticed something was wrong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why isn't there any footage of Osborne? Osborne is the state </span><span>duel</span><span> champion of Zephyr State and a strong contender for the top ten. Plus, I heard he bet nearly three million at the casino, wagering on himself to win the championship, full of confidence!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm really curious about his strength. I looked around but couldn't find Osborne's projection at all."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Seems like there's really no footage of him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's going on?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Could he already be dead? The Abyssal Planet has a harsh environment and powerful native creatures. Without his projection, maybe it's because he's already dead..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Whether he's dead or not, there's no way he can win the championship! Osborne is just from a second-rate </span><span>power,</span><span> I don't think he has any chance of winning!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Exactly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne is at the center of the volcanic area, constantly searching for the Beast Soul Flower.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sixty-fifth one!" Osborne's lips curled into a smile. The first day wasn't even over, and he had already found sixty-five Beast Soul Flowers, which could be exchanged for sixty-five million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This harvest exceeded his expectations.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne found it a bit strange. So far, apart from finding Beast Soul Flowers, he hadn't discovered any resources or treasures, nor encountered any native creatures of the Abyssal Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne pondered, "Could it be that the environment here is so harsh that even native creatures can't survive? Aside from the Beast Soul Flower, is there truly nothing else that can endure these conditions?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The process of searching for Beast Soul Flowers was a bit boring, so Osborne had time for random thoughts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, </span><span>Primordial's</span><span> voice sounded again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Osborne, I feel something's off!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at Primordial in surprise, "What's off?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne scanned the surroundings with Satan's Eye to ensure there was no danger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said seriously, "There seem to be too many </span><span>Beast</span><span> Soul Flowers here. Moreover, the locations where Beast Soul Flowers appear seem to follow a pattern... Think carefully, in this central area, isn't it true that for every hundred volcanoes, you can always find one Beast Soul Flower?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He carefully recalled, then his expression changed. He hadn't noticed it before, but after hearing Primordial, he immediately sensed something unusual.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sixty-five Beast Soul Flowers he obtained were mostly found in the central area. It indeed seemed that for every hundred volcanoes, one Beast Soul Flower could be found.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The growth of the Beast Soul Flowers indeed followed a pattern, as if they were deliberately planted here, neatly arranged.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at Primordial and said seriously, "Primordial, do you think these Beast Soul Flowers were planted by someone?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial nodded. "Aside from this possibility, I can't think of any other reason why the Beast Soul Flowers here grow so densely and neatly. This place seems like an herb field, specifically cultivated by some powerful being for Beast Soul Flowers!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you confident in your guess? What kind of being would plant Beast Soul Flowers in a place like this?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said, "Of course, powerful beast creatures!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, I think you should leave immediately! Any beast creature capable of surviving in this environment and planting Beast Soul Flowers must be incredibly powerful!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At the very least, they have reached mid Empyrean Sacredness, or even stronger..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Right now, it hasn't noticed us. If we get discovered, we're in big trouble!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
