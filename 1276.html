  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity penetrated the bodies of over four thousand Blood Demon members, establishing a deep connection, Osborne felt the bond between them strengthen significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From now on, he could channel blood energy through these roots, enhancing the potency of the energy they received.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the real game-changer was that, in critical moments, Osborne could absorb power from the Blood Demon members instantaneously through the roots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It meant that regardless of their location, he could summon their strength whenever he needed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, Osborne could rapidly elevate his level in a short time, potentially leaping one or even two ranks, reaching the level of a Superior Deity or even a Transcendent Deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne found himself face-to-face with a Transcendent Deity or even a Celestial Deity warrior while alone, with the Blood Demon members miles away, he could still tap into their power through the Lotus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, his realm could surge up by one or even two levels! With this newfound ability, he could stand a fighting chance against foes far stronger than himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was monumental for Osborne&mdash;wherever he went, he would effectively carry the strength of the entire Blood Demon army with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whew! Finally done!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne burst open his eyes, a brilliant light shooting forth from them, radiating an awe-inspiring energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't just a breakthrough to the Intermediate Deity level; he had also completed the third step of his fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. His powers, including Satan's Eye and Medusa's Gaze, had seen significant upgrades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before this, both Satan's Eye and Medusa's Gaze had absorbed core energy from the Lotus but hadn't fully integrated it. Now, with this breakthrough, they had finally completed the absorption.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne's Satan's Eye had reached the pinnacle of Level Eight, teetering on the edge of breaking into Level Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt stronger than ever, yet he sensed an invisible barrier preventing him from advancing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why can't I break through to Level Nine? It was the time distortion on Blue Planet caused by the God of Time that held me back from Level Seven. </span><span>So</span><span> Is there still something off with the laws of this world that's keeping me from progressing now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head, dismissing the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, Level Eight is still pretty solid! I'm just curious about what new abilities Level Nine might unlock."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pushed those thoughts aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After absorbing a core energy from the Lotus, Medusa's Gaze had also grown stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel the difference in its power, but he hadn't yet found a worthy opponent to test its limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It should be impressive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, Medusa's Gaze absorbed a whole core of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity! If it's not strong enough, that would be a real waste!" he murmured, continuing to explore the changes within his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "The dark elemental essence and spatial elemental essence have fully absorbed the core energy from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity! It's a shame they haven't broken through to Level Six; they've only reached the pinnacle of Level Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But honestly, that's still more than enough for now! Normally, to wield a Level Five Realm of peak strength, you'd need to be at least a Superior Deity or even a Transcendent Deity! And Level Six? That's the territory of Celestial Deities or Deity Overlords!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here I am, just an Intermediate Deity, and I've already mastered two types of Level Five elemental essences. I'm way ahead of the curve!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But my sights are set on Level Six!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I still have five more core energies from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. I can definitely use two of those to push the dark and spatial elemental essences up to Level Six!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination in his heart, Osborne sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached into his reserves and pulled out two of the core energies from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. Carefully, Osborne fed them to the dark and spatial elemental essences, allowing them to absorb the raw power of the Lotus and rapidly elevate their levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once both of them hit Level Six, Osborne's strength would skyrocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Level Six elemental essences were the exclusive domain of Celestial Deities and Deity Overlords.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He exclaimed, "Finally, it's done!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, my seclusion didn't take long, but I've accomplished everything I set out to do! I've broken through to Intermediate Deity, completed the third step of my fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, and my Satan's Eye and Medusa's Gaze have seen significant upgrades. The dark and spatial elemental essences have both gained half a level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My power has increased tremendously!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
