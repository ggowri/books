  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after, Osborne found a regular hotel not far from the Empire Hotel. As long as he activated Satan's Eye, he could clearly see the situation inside the Empire Hotel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, from here, he could also see part of the Palace and part of the Royal Sepulcher.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, when Osborne tried to use Satan's Eye to spy, he discovered that both the Palace and the Royal Sepulcher were surrounded by a powerful defensive shield, blocking his view.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all, it's the Palace and Royal Sepulcher of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, the most important places in the Glorious Divine Kingdom. It's normal that my Satan's Eye can't see through."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't pay much attention.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anyway, in ten days, the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel will begin, and a sacrificial ceremony will also be held in the Royal Sepulcher. By then, all the princes and princesses of the Royal Family will be present, and all his enemies will show up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, Clara and Leroy arrived.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Entering Osborne's small courtyard and seeing him, they showed a puzzled expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They asked in confusion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne had used the Sublime Concealment Orb to alter his aura and appearance, so they weren't sure if the person before them was really him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and reverted to his original appearance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the two women&rsquo;s faces lit up with excitement and joy. &ldquo;We knew you&rsquo;d be fine! Where have you been all this time? We couldn&rsquo;t reach you.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit awkward upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most of the time, he was far away from Racial Convergence Planet, and Clara and Leroy's terminal levels weren't high enough to reach him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Osborne returned to Racial Convergence Planet, he forgot they were still worried about him and didn&rsquo;t take the initiative to contact them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could only say, &ldquo;I went far away, beyond the terminal&rsquo;s communication range! I just returned to Racial Convergence Planet today&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They didn&rsquo;t think much of it and nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, don't be upset! Those Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, if taken, so be it! You have strength and talent, as long as you're alive, nothing else matters."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned upon hearing that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Where did you hear that my Kingdom Duel Scorepoints were stolen?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They exchanged a glance. "Everyone knows!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's said that your Kingdom Duel Badge was taken by someone named 'Lionel Lawson.' That Lionel was chased by others for a long time before finally escaping."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Right now, we still don't know where Lionel is hiding!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, they were all furious. "Damn Lionel, don't let us find out his true identity! Once we're strong enough, we'll definitely avenge you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but laugh upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So that's how it is!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back then, he was caught by Lionel and cornered in front of the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign. Indeed, he made a deal with Lionel. He traded the Kingdom Duel Badge for Lionel's Supreme Sacred Artifact&mdash;the Void Sword.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, the Void Sword was obtained, but the Kingdom Duel Badge that Lionel got...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Was swapped by Osborne at the last moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's just a pity that Lionel didn't know at the time. He thought he had truly obtained Osborne's Kingdom Duel Badge. Unwilling to share it with anyone, he fled frantically.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because of this, everyone was certain that Osborne's Kingdom Duel Badge had been taken by Lionel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Clara and Leroy thought so.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "My Kingdom Duel Badge contains your Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, over three billion each! Don't you really blame me for losing your Kingdom Duel Scorepoints?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy immediately shook their heads seriously upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, what are you saying! How could we possibly blame you! Without your help, we wouldn't even have had the chance to participate in the zone duel, let alone earn so many Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everything we have is because of you!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Those Kingdom Duel Scorepoints are gone, so be it. We don't care at all!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as you're okay!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After they finished speaking, Osborne felt a bit touched; it was worth all the help he had given them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne stopped teasing them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took out the Kingdom Duel Badge and said with a smile, "Take a look, what&rsquo;s this?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They looked over, and the next second, their eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this your Kingdom Duel Badge?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Didn't you say Lionel took it? Even Lionel admitted it! How is it still with you? Did you take the Kingdom Duel Badge back?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head and quickly explained the situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were all stunned after hearing it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Clara laughed and said, "Now, everyone in the Glorious Divine Kingdom is envying Lionel, thinking he took your Kingdom Duel Badge and hit the jackpot! But after hearing what you said, I realized... Lionel is actually the unluckiest one!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He not only failed to get your Kingdom Duel Badge but also lost his only Legendary Sacred Artifact... I can already imagine how furious and frustrated he'll be when he opens the Dimensional Bag and finds out that Kingdom Duel Badge isn't yours at all, with not a single Kingdom Duel Scorepoint on it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He's probably going to spit blood on the spot!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The key is, everyone thinks he stole your Kingdom Duel Badge. Even if he stands up to deny it, no one will believe him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy also laughed and said, "Yeah, Lionel is so unlucky! He worked so hard to chase you, then worked just as hard to escape from others... In the end, he got nothing, lost the Legendary Sacred Artifact, and took all the blame for it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, the three of them laughed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said, "Now, I'll give you your Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They quickly shook their heads.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No rush, we&rsquo;re staying at Empire Hotel, and entering requires the Kingdom Duel Badge! If you give us the Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, showing the Kingdom Duel Badge will expose the information!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's talk after the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel ends!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought for a moment and didn't insist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He carefully observed the two women and couldn't help but his eyes lit up. "It seems that in the past six months, you two haven't been idle, your strength has improved a lot! Have you both already fused the third type of power?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They heard this and smiled, nodding.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, we finally fused the third type of power! Everyone says we were just lucky, that with your help we managed to get into the top ten in the Zone Duel. They even say that with our strength, we're not qualified to represent Eastern Zone 3 in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We couldn't argue back, so we just trained harder! Fortunately, we finally broke through. Now that we've fused three types of power, we're no longer behind others participating in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel in this aspect!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's just that, in terms of overall strength, we're probably still at the bottom in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, they felt a bit upset.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their talent wasn't bad, but only a hundred people could participate in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, and every single one of them was an absolute prodigy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They still had some gap compared to them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, they all came from a Second-rate Power, and the Sect could offer them very little help, which resulted in their overall strength still lagging behind others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne couldn't help but laugh upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "There are still ten days until the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel. During these ten days, stay at my place! I have something that can help you quickly improve your strength!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne took out a bottle of Top-grade Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"One hundred drops for each person!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Each drop can put you into the Enlightenment State, enhancing your strength! After ten days... I believe your power will achieve a qualitative breakthrough!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You will definitely be the top-notch ones!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
