  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the cooperation of Osborne and Flash, all the Illusionary Heavenly Demons were quickly killed by them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over three thousand Illusionary Heavenly Demons ultimately condensed into three drops of Dragon Elixir, which Osborne stored in a jadeflare vial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He murmured, "These Illusionary Heavenly Demons are a bit weak!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They're not even as good as those Space Pirates!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The cultivation level of these Illusionary Heavenly Demons is mid Empyrean Sacredness, but they are too mechanical. Their attacks and defenses show no variation, as if they were robots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They neither cooperate nor flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as Osborne and Flash can block their attacks, dealing with them isn't hard. Even if Osborne and Flash can't take them down quickly, they can slowly kill them. The danger level is actually not high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, it's not that these Illusionary Heavenly Demons are weak, it's that you are too strong! Flash is an Astralwreck Dragon, one of the strongest in the Beast Clan. He has also mutated due to certain special reasons, becoming even stronger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even at primary Empyrean Sacredness, he can battle the advanced Empyrean Sacredness Magma Devourer! These Illusionary Heavenly Demons with only mid Empyrean Sacredness are, of course, no match for him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And your strength is even more extraordinary!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I seriously suspect now that you're not even Human! Even a group of advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors would take a long time to kill all these over three thousand mid Empyrean Sacredness Illusionary Heavenly Demons."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne touched his nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He and Flash were indeed too strong. At least within their cultivation level, Osborne hadn't found anyone stronger than them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps, deeper in the universe, there might be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at the edge of this universe, there probably aren't any.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, let's move on and gather more Dragon Elixir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sat on Flash's back and continued forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, they encountered another group of mid Empyrean Sacredness Illusionary Heavenly Demons. This time, Osborne didn't let Flash approach first. After all, fighting a group of naked Wingless Angels felt a bit strange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Osborne was about to kill them, he always felt a bit reluctant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when facing the ferocious and terrifying Magma Devourer, he could strike without hesitation, feeling no guilt at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne kept pulling the Bloodwrought Bow, while Flash continuously spewed Dragon's Breath and swung its claws. Their coordination became increasingly seamless. Soon, they had taken care of this group of Illusionary Heavenly Demons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They obtained three more drops of Dragon Elixir!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, it was Top-grade Dragon Elixir, with effects comparable to Elven Sacred Water, making it extremely valuable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For the next three days, Osborne kept killing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Illusionary Heavenly Demons didn't truly exist; they were merely formed from strands of Demon Dragon's Breath. In this illusionary space, the Illusionary Heavenly Demons seemed endless. One group would fall, and another would immediately appear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In three days, Osborne hardly rested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the battle maniac, Flash, was utterly exhausted by now. He was reluctant to move. His energy was drained too much, and he couldn't hold on anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne was still full of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over the past three days, he had killed far more Illusionary Heavenly Demons than Flash because his Solar Sacred Arrow was incredibly powerful. Every time, Osborne used Arrow Storm without holding back on Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, he had the Chaotic Spiritual Root and didn't need to worry about exhausting his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash unleashed Dragon's Breath, and although his killing speed was also fast, he had to rest every now and then. Therefore, his kill count naturally couldn't match Osborne's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, they had already collected a whole bottle of Top-grade Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At least two hundred drops of Top-grade Dragon Elixir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's smile was radiant. This was just the harvest of three days. The effect of Top-grade Dragon Elixir was comparable to Elven Sacred Water. The value of two hundred drops of Dragon Elixir was immeasurable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Unfortunately, we still haven't encountered advanced Empyrean Sacredness Illusionary Heavenly Demons!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Top-grade Dragon Elixir doesn't have much effect on me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I need Legendary Dragon Elixir! Only by killing advanced Empyrean Sacredness Illusionary Heavenly Demons can I obtain Legendary Dragon Elixir! But we've been killing mid Empyrean Sacredness Illusionary Heavenly Demons for three days. When will we finally encounter advanced Empyrean Sacredness Illusionary Heavenly Demons?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was dissatisfied with the current harvest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a cluster of meteorite bodies suddenly appeared ahead of them. They were smaller than the ones they had encountered before, and there were only about a thousand of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the aura they emitted was even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne instantly felt excited. "We've finally found advanced Empyrean Sacredness Illusionary Heavenly Demons!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was very happy but didn&rsquo;t rush to attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A thousand advanced Empyrean Sacredness Illusionary Heavenly Demons wouldn&rsquo;t be so easy to handle. In Osborne's view, among all the forces that entered the Phantomagic Realm, fewer than ten could deal with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warriors were needed to lead the team, withstand the attacks of these Illusionary Heavenly Demons at the front, so they could figure out a way to gradually deal with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, they might face annihilation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once Flash recovered, Osborne joined him in action. In terms of defense, Flash was stronger than Osborne and could draw attacks for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In terms of attack power, Osborne was stronger than Flash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially since his Bloodwrought Bow had become a Mid-grade Sacred Artifact, and his body had advanced to advanced Empyrean Sacredness. Using the Earth Arrow, he could easily kill ordinary advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Flash defending at the front, Osborne could safely shoot from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, it took them a full half hour to kill this group of advanced Empyrean Sacredness Illusionary Heavenly Demons. By the end, Flash was covered in wounds and looked a bit battered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, those were just surface wounds and didn&rsquo;t affect Flash much. Plus, his self-healing ability was quick. Moreover, Osborne could use the power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to help Flash recover. As a result, his injuries healed quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne took out a new jadeflare vial and filled it with the sparkling Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is Legendary Dragon Elixir!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its aura made Osborne feel all his pores open up, making him want to consume it immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he suppressed that thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he consumed the Legendary Dragon Elixir, he would immediately enter the Enlightenment State, traveling through the universe in the illusionary space, deepening his understanding of the world and power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each Enlightenment State takes several days, or even longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, this is the Legendary Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By the time Osborne absorbed its power and woke up from the Enlightenment State, the Phantomagic Realm would likely be nearly gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I can't waste time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When the Phantomagic Realm disappears and I find my parents, I'll have plenty of time to use the Legendary Dragon Elixir! But for now, the most important thing is to collect as much Legendary Dragon Elixir as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne continued forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This isolated illusionary space seemed boundless and vast. Every time he advanced a certain distance, he would encounter a group of advanced Empyrean Sacredness Illusionary Heavenly Demons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And their numbers kept increasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the blink of an eye, another seven days passed. Osborne had been in the Phantomagic Realm for ten days!</span></p><div class="pagination">
