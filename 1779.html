  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A commanding voice echoed through the air, emanating from a Supreme Malevolence Airship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the speaker remained hidden, everyone here immediately adopted a serious demeanor, showing deep respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! Understood!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oberon bowed respectfully toward the direction of the airship, shooting a fierce glare at Hannah before falling silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne narrowed his eyes, glancing at the Supreme Malevolence Airship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He soon caught sight of an elderly figure emerging from the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a warrior from Paramount Supreme Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the figure, Osborne couldn't help but stiffen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A peak Deity King! Paramount Supreme Clan actually sent a peak Deity King warrior to join us! They really do hold the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings in high regard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, he shifted his gaze to Ambrose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that we're free of distractions, we can kick off the arena battle! Let's stick to the eight-on-eight rule. You send up eight fighters!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Osborne finished speaking, determination flashed in Ambrose's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sounds good! Once we've assembled our teams, we can get started right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual nod, Ambrose turned to the crowd of over a hundred young talents from various clans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each one had reached the Deity King level, and they were all top-tier geniuses from the ten Upper Races, brimming with confidence and eager to step into the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me go up first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to be first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to be among the first to fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Count me in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ambrose barked, "Enough with the shouting! I know everyone wants to be the first to take on the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings and claim the rewards for defeating them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But this bickering isn't going to help. Let's form teams freely, eight per team, and try to pair up based on our strengths. Once the teams are set, we'll draw lots to determine the order of appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The team that defeats the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings will snag one-third of the rewards, while the remaining two-thirds will be shared among the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That way, everyone can walk away with something worthwhile!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ambrose surveyed the crowd. "Any objections?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sounds good to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm on board!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Count me in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Agreed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd quickly rallied behind Ambrose's proposal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great! Let's get to team building! We have a total of 128 Deity King-level fighters among us, which means we can form sixteen teams!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the young warriors began to form their teams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, sixteen teams were established, with Ambrose's team standing out as the strongest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His seven teammates were all at the peak of the early Deity King stage, and with Ambrose himself at mid-stage Deity King, their combined strength was formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, let's draw lots to determine the order of appearance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The results came in quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The team that drew the first spot erupted in excited cheers, and their enthusiasm was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Defeating the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings would mean they could get one third of the reward alone, claiming a hefty reward for each member.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately for Ambrose, he drew the ninth spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned but kept his mouth shut. After all, he was the one who proposed the rules, and he couldn't very well break them now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ambrose turned his attention to the first team stepping up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them was Orson from Thunderstorm Drake Clan, along with Stellan from Snow Fox Clan and Lazarus Gentry from Raging Elephant Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strength of these eight fighters wasn't overwhelming, but they were certainly no pushovers either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ambrose warned, "Orson! Be careful with the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They dared to challenge us, so they must have some serious skills. We can mock them outwardly, but we must stay vigilant in our hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You represent the geniuses of our young generation. Don't let us down! If you can beat them, great. If not, at least find out their true capabilities."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ambrose finished, and Orson laughed coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ambrose, rest easy. My skills may not match yours, but I can handle a few scummy Human Community members. These Seven Young Deity Kings? Haha! I'll have them begging for mercy before I'm done. You'll see who the true losers are!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With fire in his eyes, Orson exchanged glances with Stellan, Lazarus, and the others, then confidently strode onto the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings! And the trash from Mystic Feather Clan, Hannah! Get over here to die! A bunch of scum calling out to challenge our young geniuses? Nice try. But now, I'm going to show you all what 'trash' really means!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Orson unleashed a burst of divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His teammates followed suit, and their combined energies created an ominous aura that pressed down on Osborne and his team from across the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle was about to ignite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scanned Orson and his eight companions and couldn't help but chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eight Deity King initials?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not a single one of you is at the mid-stage?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Asking for a beating?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
