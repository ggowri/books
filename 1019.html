  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne barely used any effort to slice through the Ultra Diamond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though it was the top-tier super material developed by the Draco Group Materials Research Institute, it clearly paled compared to the material used in the Goddess of Grain's scythe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Osborne found the Ultra Diamond rather unimpressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could cut through others&rsquo; divine artifacts&mdash;including even top-grade ones&mdash;but only with full strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without overwhelming force, the Goddess of Grain's scythe couldn't even sever an Ordinary divine artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Antonio, puzzled. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You said the hardness of Ultra Diamond surpasses that of most divine artifacts, right? But to me, it feels like they are poles apart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Antonio was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he quickly jumped into the explanation. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, that's not how we measure it! The reason divine artifacts feel harder to you is that they possess power! The creators of divine artifacts imbue them with strength, making them 'alive'!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To destroy a divine artifact, you need to break not just the material itself but also the 'power' it possesses, which makes it much more challenging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And this piece of Ultra Diamond is just a regular material. Without any power on it, it's naturally flimsy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In fact, if any deity were to grant it power, Ultra Diamond would be on par with ordinary divine artifacts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rubbed his nose awkwardly, realizing he'd made a blunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you're saying that as our technology advances, one day we could even make divine artifacts ourselves?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Antonio said seriously, "Absolutely! As long as you, Mr. Augustine, reach the level of a deity and master divine power, you could endow them with strength and transform them into divine artifacts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rubbed his nose again, feeling a bit sheepish. He wasn't even close to Class S, let alone a deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That felt so far out of reach!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But thanks to Antonio's explanations, he finally understood how divine artifacts were created.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about its hardness? Is it sufficient?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Antonio's eyes lit up as he gazed at the Goddess of Grain's scythe, his excitement </span><span>palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"More than enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's definitely the hardest and sharpest divine artifact I've ever seen! It clearly hasn't been empowered by any deity, so it's not technically a divine artifact, yet it can effortlessly slice through Ultra Diamond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although I haven't conducted a detailed test yet, its hardness is estimated at least ten times that of diamond&mdash;possibly even higher! I'm going to take it for testing and analysis right now. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps through this, we can indeed develop Hyper Diamond, taking our advanced materials to the next level."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With huge excitement, Antonio carefully took the Goddess of Grain's scythe and rushed to test it with the institute's cutting-edge technology.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curious, Osborne lingered instead of leaving right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The testing results came in soon. When Antonio reviewed them, his eyes went wide with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the matter?" Osborne asked, intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Antonio took a deep breath and exclaimed, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, it&rsquo;s amazing! Our best instruments couldn't measure its exact hardness, meaning it exceeds the higher detection limits of the equipment. The limit was fifty times the hardness of a diamond!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In our previous analyses of divine artifacts, the toughest one only matched up to ten times the hardness of a diamond! Most couldn't even reach twice the hardness!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's definitely the toughest super material I've ever seen!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's even more incredible is that we've managed to analyze 99% of its components! If we can try out based on these findings, even if we can't replicate its hardness exactly, we'll still make significant strides!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm confident we can develop Hyper Diamond within three days! And who knows? In the near future, we could even create even more advanced materials like Mega Diamond and Tera Diamond!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but share in Antonio's enthusiasm. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let's get to work! With the looming threat, we need more super energy guns and cutting-edge weaponry now more than ever!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Antonio replied with determination written all over his face, "Absolutely! You can count on me, Mr. Augustine! I won't let you down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he dove headfirst into his work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Kash from the Weapons Research Institute was buoyant. He had everything in place; once Hyper Diamond was successfully developed, he'd be ready to mass-produce a new line of weapons and gear that would outshine anything they had made before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne decided it was time to check in with the second-in-command at the Weapons Research Institute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He summoned Giovanni Mirante, Antonio's brother, and another top-tier researcher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Antonio was focused on Hyper Diamond, Giovanni had been tasked with other critical projects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne asked, "Giovanni, have you finished analyzing the samples of ore that were sent over? Any new discoveries?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
