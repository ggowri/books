  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl's voice called after him, tinged with urgency. "You don't even want to know who I am?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't pause. "Not really! No matter who you are, I'm in no position to mess with you. If I can't handle it, I'd rather just keep my distance. I'm not interested in playing games with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he walked out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl stood there, stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He just walked away?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This isn't what I expected at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't even ask for my name or my background before leaving, and he doesn't want the 30 million Essence Crystals?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She muttered to herself, "This is interesting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's definitely not like the others from the Human Community. But I'm left wondering if he really is just a little off in the head or if there's something more to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Regardless, if you don't want me to follow you, I'll find a way to uncover what I need to know!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We will meet again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, an extravagant pair of wings appeared behind her, enveloping her form, and in an instant, she vanished from sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne returned to stand before the group of human slaves he had freed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throughout the walk back, Tiana hadn't asked what had transpired in the room, and Osborne didn't inquire about that mysterious girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to her, these human slaves felt far more ordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne surveyed them, he noticed that none of them had left; they all chose to stay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you all you're free now. If you want to leave, no one is stopping you. So why is it that every one of you is still here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged glances, uncertainty written across their faces, and silence enveloped them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Tiana spoke up, "Let me clarify. They haven't left because they're afraid. Even though you've freed them and restored their identities, they're still seen as the lowest of the low by the other races in the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They ended up here because they don't have the powerful connections or backgrounds that protect them. So even if they leave this place, they'll be targets again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It wouldn't take long before they're once more cornered by some big player and put back up for auction."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A frown creased Osborne's brow at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even with their slave status erased and their identities restored, they can't lead normal lives? Just because they belong to the Human Community?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana continued, her tone somber, "As harsh as it is, that's the brutal truth! The Human Community members who live normally in Wild Flame City all have significant backing that makes the powerful clans think twice about grabbing them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your family, the Swift family, for instance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But there are probably fewer than ten groups like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For the rest of the Human Community, living a normal life in this city is nearly impossible! They'd end up hiding out in the wild, praying they wouldn't get caught by those predator teams from the larger powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or they could go work at one of the big mining sites for the Ninth Dark Deity Legion, becoming miners. Those predator teams typically leave those Human Community miners alone at the major sites. But being a miner is hardly different from being a slave. They still face the threat of the Deathborn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had known that life for the Human Community in Wild Flame City was tough, but he hadn't realized just how dire the situation was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he only carried Lachlan's memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a young master of the Swift family, Lachlan had always been shielded by their influence. The other clans might look down on Lachlan and dismiss him, but they would never dare to act against him. There was no risk of him being captured and sold into the slave market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of this, he was completely unaware of the harsh realities faced by ordinary members of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside of a few powerful clans that could protect their own, the rest of the Human Community faced a grim fate. Either they lived their lives in hiding, constantly on the run from predator teams sent by the major powers, or they became laborers in large mining operations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If neither of those options was available, they would inevitably end up as slaves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression darkened as the weight of this reality settled over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, one of the three women of Celestial Deity rank stepped forward a few paces and addressed Osborne directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's right. Thank you for buying us and keeping us out of the hands of the other races. We're grateful for the chance at freedom, but the reason we haven't left is because, like she said, we're afraid. Without the protection of a powerful clan, stepping outside these walls would only put us in the sights of those hunting teams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'd be captured again and put back on the auction block. There's no escaping that! Even as Celestial Deity-level beings, we can't live a normal life within the city's confines!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she finished speaking, the other women nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair and frustration flickered in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This revelation only deepened the frown on Osborne's face. He hadn't grasped just how simplistic his understanding of their plight had been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What can we do then?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
