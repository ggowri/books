  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maisie's expression turned sour as she confronted the accusations from Ezra and the other vice-presidents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was left tongue-tied, unable to come up with a single excuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Prior to the state duel, she'd made it crystal clear to Leroy that she was to back Jared whole-hog and help him snag a top-ten spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But on the very first day of the duel, Leroy had gone head-to-head with Jared, and as a result, she'd had to pull out of the team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, the seven vice-presidents were a bit let down, but they didn't kick up a big stink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Jared was on fire. He led his team straight into the top ten, and things were looking rosy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Jared's success, Leroy's departure was quickly swept under the rug. Since Leroy was no longer on the team, Azure Haven Academy was out of the running for the top-ten glory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, the tide turned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Jared and his crew cornered Leroy and Clara, the other seven vice-presidents were over the moon. They were cracking jokes and having a ball.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ezra even ribbed Maisie, saying that after getting beaten, Leroy would end up being an unexpected asset to Jared's team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Jared made it to the top ten, Leroy would get a slice of the credit, and that would be a feather in Azure Haven Academy's cap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But not long after Ezra's quip, Osborne showed up like a knight in shining armor, rescuing Leroy and Clara. Then, he laid waste to Jared and his entire team with ruthless efficiency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the seven vice-presidents went as quiet as mice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, all hell broke loose. They flew into a rage and turned their fury on Leroy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ezra fixed Maisie with a cold stare and said icily, "Ms. Maisie Holiday, Leroy has to be given a harsh punishment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All of us from the Eight Great Academies have poured our hearts and souls into this state duel, dreaming of a top-ten finish. But now, thanks to Leroy, everything's going down the drain! Jared's hurt, and we're practically out of the running for that top ten. Our chances have been completely shot to hell!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're holding Azure Haven Academy accountable! You've got to make proper amends to the other seven academies!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maisie bit her lip, the frustration churning inside her like a tempest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't pin the blame for our failure to make the top ten on Leroy! If anyone's to blame, it's Jared. He just didn't cut the mustard. He's no leader!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Actually, Jared misread the situation and picked a fight with someone he couldn't take on. He not only failed to score points off others, but he also lost his own and ended up getting himself hurt! What a mess!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Jared hadn't led the team so poorly, Leroy would never have clashed with him and had to pull out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And if Jared had been tough enough, he wouldn't have been beaten by Osborne and landed in the hospital!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she finished speaking, Maisie shot Jared a scathing look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's be real. If we don't make the top ten, it's Jared who should shoulder the blame&mdash;you and your Radiant Enigmas Academy. Maybe things would have turned out differently if Leroy had been the captain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words left the seven vice presidents stunned into silence for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Did she really just twist it like that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ezra was trembling with outrage. "Ms. Maisie Holiday, this is ridiculous! Jared is at the top of the rankings, the strongest of all! Who else would you suggest we choose as captain? It's not Leroy's call!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The clash between Jared and Leroy was still Leroy's responsibility! And as for Jared provoking a strong opponent? Osborne hails from your Tempest Fortress City. Given his power, why didn't you warn us sooner?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This all stems from your failure to provide reliable intel, and that's what led to this mess!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maisie let out a disbelieving scoff. "Me being unreasonable? You guys from Radiant Enigmas Academy were the ones who proposed this alliance of the Eight Great Academies! And who did you pick as the team leader? One of your own! In the end, if Jared makes it into the top ten, all the glory goes straight to Radiant Enigmas Academy, while Azure Haven Academy gets zilch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So now I'm the bad guy for causing a stir? Fine, if that's the way it is, let's just scrap the alliance! You can go it alone, Radiant Enigmas Academy. We at Azure Haven Academy are out of this mess!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It looked like Maisie and Ezra were about to have a full-blown showdown. The other six vice presidents could see things were going south fast, so they quickly stepped in to play peacemaker, trying to soothe the ruffled feathers of the two angry academicians.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them pleaded, "Hey, folks, let's take a chill pill! The state duel ain't over yet. Arguing and finger-pointing right now won't do us any good! We still have a shot. The Eight Great Academies have been in this together for ages. We shouldn't let a minor squabble tear us apart!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're spot on! Let's not lose heart..." another chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to their words, both Ezra and Maisie started to simmer down, but they still huffed at each other and avoided making eye contact. Clearly, their beef wasn't going to be settled so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other vice presidents exchanged worried looks and let out a collective sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's such a shame. This state duel was our best shot at cracking the top ten. Now, with Jared injured and losing one-tenth of our points, our chances of breaking into the top ten are nearly gone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the vice presidents turned their attention back to the projection, only to be left utterly flabbergasted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes widened in disbelief, and they sprang to their feet, brimming with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can this be?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, at the first layer of Arctic Maw Chasm, Osborne had just taken down Jared's squad. With a cold smirk, he seized Jared's emblem and stuck it next to his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, his score skyrocketed by an astounding 320 thousand points, while Jared's plummeted from 3.2 million to 2.88 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Worse yet, his ranking tumbled from tenth to twelfth place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne just flashed an icy, victorious smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Leroy and Clara walked over. They glanced at Jared's dropping ranking, and Leroy couldn't help but let out a soft sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she used to be on that team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The alliance of the Eight Great Academies had set their sights on a top-ten finish, but now it felt like she'd single-handedly torpedoed their chances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy, even though she didn't regret his choices, felt a twinge of unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a disciple of Azure Haven Academy and a member of the Eight-Great-Academies alliance, she'd wanted them to snag a top-ten spot just as much as anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was no way Leroy could get in Osborne's way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Osborne defeated Jared, he was eligible to receive one-tenth of Jared's points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy asked, "What's our next play?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's only half a day left in the state duel. Osborne, do you still think you can crack the top ten? If you're going for it, we're more than happy to lend a hand! Each of us can transfer 800 thousand points. We can give you a tenth of what we've got.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If everything goes according to plan, you could rack up around 800 thousand points! Sure, we're a long shot from the three million of the top-ten teams, but if we get lucky and manage to take out a few high-ranked squads, you've still got a fighting chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara bobbed her head up and down eagerly. "You bet! Osborne, we're dead-set on helping you make it into the top ten!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing their words of encouragement, Osborne gave a serene smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shoot for the top ten? Absolutely! But here's the thing, I'm not stopping there! We're all going to make it into the top ten together! Alright, let's start doling out those points!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
