  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne channeled spatial energy through the Bloodwrought Bow, unleashing a terrifying spatial arrow that shot toward Icy Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed was astonishing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the arrow left the bowstring, it vanished, only to reappear right in front of Icy Six before he could even react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no choice but to brace himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's space elemental essence had reached the late Level Nine, making his strength formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Bloodwrought Bow backing him, its power became even more terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Icy Six couldn't fully withstand it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The explosive spatial arrow detonated, tearing through Icy Six's divine power defenses, and threatening to shatter them completely. The force sent him staggering backward, his expression a mix of shock and anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, all of Osborne's over a hundred clones sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Oblivion Slash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Oblivion Slash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Oblivion Slash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A total of 156 Spatial Clones unleashed Osborne's space-based Divine Ascendance Technique in perfect unison, their coordination seamless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Endless Dimensional Razors surged toward Icy Six like crashing waves, seemingly never-ending.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Six's face paled in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his strength, he could probably shrug off a single Dimensional Razor, but 156 clones each launching a barrage of them? That was a different story altogether.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was relentless!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impossible?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Six felt a chill run down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no choice but to defend himself with all his might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless Dimensional Razors rained down upon him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, meanwhile, was relentless, continuously drawing back the Bloodwrought Bow. His attacks were far stronger than those of his clones, each arrow capable of tearing through Icy Six's divine power defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, there was no denying Icy Six's strength. Even in this dire situation, he managed to hold his ground. Though Osborne's onslaught chipped away at his defenses, Icy Six quickly restored them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like they were locked in a war of attrition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow, thinking, "Still not strong enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap in cultivation levels is too wide! I have a significant advantage, but my attack power is lacking. I can't convert this edge into a decisive victory!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To defeat Icy Six, I need to wear down his divine power... but that's going to be tough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't have much time! The seal of the Ninefold Heaven's Tower can only hold for ten minutes, and we're already three minutes in! My goal isn't just to survive their attacks but to take out as many of them as possible! I have to finish off Icy Six quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fierce glint flashed in Osborne's eyes as he brainstormed his next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Icy Six was beginning to regain his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank goodness! His cultivation level is low, and he can barely break through my defenses. Recovering from this is easy! If his attack power were any stronger, I'd be in serious trouble!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, even though I'm in a battle of attrition, I'm not worried!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can hold out for quite a while!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Icy Six shifted his focus from defeating Osborne to figuring out how to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only pray for Icy Seven and Icy Eight, hoping they could hold their ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he defended against the relentless onslaught, Icy Six's thoughts raced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We really underestimated the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after this experience, I won't make the same mistake again! Such terrifying strength and talent can't be allowed to survive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other side, Osborne was relentless in his assault while simultaneously pondering his next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can I completely tear through Icy Six's defenses?" he wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he couldn't think of a solid plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using spatial energy to activate the Bloodwrought Bow was his strongest attack, but even that only managed to create a small breach in Icy Six's divine power defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed something more to break through completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe a soul attack would do the trick. Soul Spark Oblivion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne unleashed a soul attack aimed directly at Icy Six, forcing his soul power to ignite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Icy Six was quick on the draw, immediately slicing through the ignited soul power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A protective layer of special energy enveloped his Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! Osborne, you've got quite the arsenal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can even use soul attacks, and they're pretty powerful! But guess what? That won't work on me. You can't kill me!" Icy Six taunted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't respond, but he furrowed his brow, feeling increasingly frustrated and trapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a voice echoed in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you being so dense?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart leaped. "Primordial! You're awake?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you digested all the Tree Heart energy from the Eighth World Tree offshoot? What cultivation level are you at now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial grumbled with a hint of annoyance, "Thanks to you, I only managed to absorb thirty percent of the Tree Heart energy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now I'm stuck at Ascension Five! I could have hit Ascension Seven!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but roll his eyes. "You're not satisfied with Ascension Five?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've just come into existence, and you've already surpassed me! You were nothing but a fragile little sapling before, and now you're at Ascension Five, far beyond where I am..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A pang of jealousy gnawed at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Why is it that I've worked my tail off for years just to reach Ascension One, while you breeze in and hit Ascension Five without breaking a sweat?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ascension Five is the pinnacle for warriors in Celestara!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! You think you can compare yourself to me? I'm a World Tree offshoot!" Primordial replied with a hint of pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne brushed off Primordial's boastfulness and quickly said, "Since you've hit Ascension Five, you must have a way to help me take him down, right? He's at Ascension Five too, and you're a World Tree offshoot... you can't possibly be unable to handle him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial scoffed. "You want me to help you take him down for free?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think I'm a fool? Sure, I could easily deal with him since we're both at the same level, but I won't do it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if I don't intervene, you can take care of him yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne blinked in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean I can handle him? My strongest attack can barely breach his defenses! I'm stuck in a war of attrition here! Time is running out, and I can't possibly wear down his divine power completely!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial exclaimed, "Idiot! You can break through his defenses completely; you just don't know how to use your divine power properly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you remember the energy from the Bloodstrike Orb?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bloodstrike Orb energy?" Osborne echoed, confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! Your strange eye absorbed the energy from the Bloodstrike Orb, which has given your divine power some of its characteristics&mdash;namely, corrosion!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
