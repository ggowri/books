  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression darkened. The defenses of the headquarters had been breached!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In mere moments, more than two thousand clones from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> would pour in, unleashing chaos and bloodshed. There were just over a thousand members of the Draco Armed Services Branch&mdash;there was no way they could stand against such a </span><span>force!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then there were those ten Class S clones, the true harbingers of doom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa Queen's eyes gleamed with a chilling light. Wherever her gaze fell, chaos followed as thick stone skin enveloped her targets instantaneously, petrifying them on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Wolf King was no less terrifying, his claws swiping through the air with lethal precision. Even Osborne's formidable martial art aura couldn't completely deflect the onslaught, let alone the hapless members of the Draco Armed Services Branch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, they fell, their bodies sliced in two, innards spilling out as they crumpled to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Tauren Kings rampaged through the crowd. Anything that stood in their path&mdash;regardless of power&mdash;was met with brutal force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A single punch from a Titan King could send dozens flying, while a casual stomp crushed several members of the Draco Armed Services Branch underfoot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Vampire King added to the horror, manipulating the blood of the defenders, causing it to surge and erupt from their bodies. Within seconds, many fell to the ground, lifeless and drained of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ten Class S clones unleashed their full might, wreaking havoc among the more than a thousand members of the Draco Armed Services Branch, leaving a trail of devastation in their wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was nothing short of slaughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes flashed crimson with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena's face paled as she shouted, "Fall back! Retreat deeper into the headquarters!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her command, a number of Draco Armed Services members began to withdraw into the inner sanctum, seeking refuge behind stronger defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, far too many were already ensnared by the relentless clones, unable to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, get out of here now!" Serena shouted over the din.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his gaze wild and determined, Osborne replied coolly, "Ms. Hernandez, you lead them to safety and regroup. I'll buy you some time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another thought, he stepped forward instead of retreating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Domain!" Osborne declared, activating his ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though it only held for mere seconds, it was enough for him to unleash his spatial power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the heat of chaos, a fissure in space opened up, swallowing hundreds of battered members of the Draco Armed Services Branch who had thought all hope was lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they understood what was happening, they found themselves teleported to safety outside the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get back!" Osborne shouted, his voice cutting through the clamor as he struck again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thunder Realm! Thunder of Judgment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deafening roar, the Thunder Realm flared to life, but only for seconds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those fleeting moments were enough for Osborne to unleash dozens of </span><span>Thunder</span><span> of Judgment, each one crashing down upon the clones. The sheer force obliterated them, leaving nothing but ashes in their wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, more trapped members of the Draco Armed Services Branch seized </span><span>the opportunity and fled to safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's actions had finally caught the attention of several Class S clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The closest was a Medusa Queen, flanked by two Vampire Kings, and they charged at him with lethal intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three Class S clones targeted Osborne. The Medusa Queen's eyes shone hungrily, aiming to petrify him, while the two Vampire Kings sought to drain his blood from his very veins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena and the others watched in horror, panic rising in their chests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne stood resolute, unfazed by the chaos swirling around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wore a smirk. "If it were other Class S clones attacking me, I might've been in a tough fight, at least too busy to save anyone else! But it's you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vampire Kings?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even as Class S, you're nothing but mere mortals before me! Thinking you could control my blood? That's just foolish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a blink of an eye, Osborne transformed into a Vampire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The aura of the Vampire progenitor enveloped the two Vampire Kings, filling their faces with terror and causing their bodies to tremble violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blood!" Osborne roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a gesture, the two Class S Vampire Kings were instantly immobilized. Their blood gushed out, forming a river that flowed towards Osborne, who grasped it in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the bodies of the two Class S Vampire Kings collapsed and exploded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearby, the Medusa Queen stood in shock, staring at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two Vampire Kings, her equals, had died so easily? They couldn't even put up a fight against Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A look of dread filled her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dammit! We need to kill him first!" Medusa Queen exclaimed, quickly signaling to the other Class S clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, eight of them surrounded Osborne.</span></p><div class="pagination">
