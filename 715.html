  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa and Donna clung to each other, weeping openly for their losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment, then quietly stepped away, giving them the space they needed to grieve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tragedy that had befallen the Radcliffe family weighed heavily on them, and they deserved time to let their pain out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his hands, Osborne held Luca's massive axe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weapon was a sight to behold&mdash;ten feet long, with a blade over three feet wide. It was exceptionally heavy and shone with a bronze hue, radiating an aura of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he gripped the Axe of Strength, he felt its energy pulsing through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was no ordinary weapon; it was a genuine divine artifact!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca had claimed it was the copper axe of Hermes, the river god. According to legend, Hermes possessed three axes: the golden axe, the silver axe, and the copper axe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The golden axe commanded life, the silver axe wielded thunder, and the copper axe was the embodiment of strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne recalled the famous tale of Hermes and the woodcutter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once, a woodcutter accidentally dropped his axe into the river and sat by the bank, crying. Hermes happened to pass by and, upon learning of the man's plight, dove into the water to retrieve the axe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, he brought up a golden axe, which the woodcutter rejected. Next, he fetched a silver axe, but again the woodcutter declined. Finally, Hermes retrieved the woodcutter's own axe, and the man gratefully accepted it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Impressed by the woodcutter's honesty, Hermes gifted him all three axes, imbuing the woodcutter's axe with magical powers that made it lighter and capable of delivering immense force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This story was known worldwide, and Osborne had heard it often during his time at the orphanage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The matron would tell it to instill values of honesty and humility in the children.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, as he held the Axe of Strength, he murmured, "Hermes, the river god? Did he really exist? The more powerful I become and the more I encounter, the closer the idea of divine beings feels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I'm not even Class AAA, let alone Class S. It's a bit premature to be thinking about gods right now. Even if I knew something, it wouldn't do me any good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaking his head, he dismissed such thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, the Axe of Strength was simply a powerful divine artifact, a means to enhance his abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca had wielded it with terrifying skill, making him one of the most formidable opponents Osborne had ever faced. If it hadn't been for the Trident of Poseidon, if Osborne hadn't been at sea, if he hadn't been able to unleash the Trident's power, even with Clarissa and Emma by his side, taking down Luca would have been nearly impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne declared, determination filling his voice, "This Axe of Strength is mine now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope you're strong enough not to let me down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he decided to test its power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mimicking Luca's earlier movements, he hoisted the Axe of Strength high above his head. Instantly, a surge of energy flowed from the axe into his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weapon erupted with a rich black glow, causing the sky to tremble ominously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's cheeks flushed as a terrifying force brewed within him, urging him to unleash it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt that even a mountain would crumble before him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mountain Splitter!" Osborne roared, swinging the Axe of Strength down with all his might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of black energy surged forth, extending hundreds of yards as the axe struck the ocean's surface. The water parted violently, creating a massive trench nearly a thousand yards long, several hundred yards deep, and almost a hundred yards wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying attack triggered a massive tsunami, surging outwards in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared in stunned amazement at the chaos unfolding before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What incredible power! That Axe of Strength move nearly magnified my power tenfold! Even if a whole group of Class AAA fighters stood before me, I could probably slice through them effortlessly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder Luca was so confident!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too bad for Luca, though. He happened to run into me, someone wielding the Trident of Poseidon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, Clarissa and I would probably be dead by now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Breathing heavily, Osborne marveled at the sheer strength of the Mountain Splitter technique. It was powerful, but it had drained him significantly, making his arms tremble slightly. He couldn't summon another Mountain Splitter anytime soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This Mountain Splitter move boosts my power tenfold! Even regular attacks can amplify my strength fivefold!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Truly, the Axe of Strength lives up to its name!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My strength was already formidable. With the Axe of Strength in my hands, it's even more terrifying than in Luca's. If I had had the Axe of Strength earlier, taking down those Class AAA Evolved Humans wouldn't have been so difficult."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was thoroughly impressed with the Axe of Strength's performance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The commotion he had caused drew the attention of Donna and the others, who hurried over to see what was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they saw the massive trench, nearly a thousand yards long, that Osborne had cleaved into the sea with a single swing of his axe, they were left in stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan and Eugen, in particular, were filled with sheer terror.</span></p><div class="pagination">
