  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There are only two ways to break into the&nbsp;Global Godson Rankings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Either demonstrate extraordinary strength and achieve brilliant victories to gain the&nbsp;Diviner League's&nbsp;recognition, or publicly challenge and defeat a ranked expert, taking their spot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today's arena was the opportunity for challengers to take on the masters of the&nbsp;Global Godson Rankings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, the crowd erupted into a commotion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"They're here! They're finally here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The experts from the&nbsp;Global Godson Rankings&nbsp;are here to accept challenges!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Look, that's Emi Byrd!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She's ranked 499th on the&nbsp;Global Godson Rankings!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing this, Osborne turned to the distance and saw a group of incredibly powerful young figures approaching quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were about fifty of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Each of them exuded a terrifying aura. Even the woman leading them looked at Osborne and the others with cold arrogance, scanning them with disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne clearly noticed the scorn in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are they all the monsters from the&nbsp;Global Godson Rankings? Weren't there supposed to be over a hundred from the younger generation on the rankings?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why are there only about fifty here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne asked, confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett quickly explained, "These people are monsters from the&nbsp;Global Godson Rankings! They're known as&nbsp;Earth Godsons. All of them are ranked beyond 400 because those ranked higher won't even bother to show up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We're not even worthy to challenge those at the top. These Godsons ranked in the 400s are more than enough for us to deal with. But tomorrow, during the&nbsp;Honor Quest Ceremony, all the top-ranked&nbsp;Earth Godsons&nbsp;of the younger generation will probably show up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett's eyes burned with fighting spirit as he locked onto a figure in the crowd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was a man in his forties.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man was also looking back at Rhett with a disdainful sneer and even made a throat-slashing gesture toward him, exuding intense killing intent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clearly, there was some bad blood between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Rhett, who is that?" Stuart asked, frowning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett took a deep breath, his expression cold. "That's Andrew Perry, heir to the hidden Perry family of Rosmandi. Three years ago, he defeated me when I first tried to break into the Global Godson Rankings. I accepted my loss back then. He was stronger than me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But he humiliated me afterward! I've never been able to let it go, and I've been challenging him for years, but I've never won. This year, I'll challenge him again, and I will win!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett's determination was clear in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart's expression was serious. "Rhett, what rank is he on the&nbsp;Global Godson Rankings?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"465!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ranked 465?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart frowned deeply. "Rhett, I think you should challenge someone ranked lower. You'd have a better chance of success."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Rhett shook his head firmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No! For me, making the&nbsp;Global Godson Rankings&nbsp;is far less important than defeating him. I need to give him back all the humiliation he's put me through!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing this, Stuart didn't push further. He could feel Rhett's anger. Andrew's humiliation had become a psychological barrier for Rhett.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For Rhett, defeating Andrew was more important than making the&nbsp;Global Godson Rankings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, the fifty-plus Godsons&nbsp;approached.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seats had already been prepared for them above the arena.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Godsons took their seats one by one, gazing down at the crowd below with disdainful eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Another boring challenge," one of them said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I wonder if anyone will dare to challenge me this time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A young man seated in the center spoke indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's eyes were drawn to the emblem on the man's chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Like the others, he had an emblem representing his status, but he was different. It had a number on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"401!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne looked at the others. All of them had numbers on their emblems, ranging from 400 to 500.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne instantly realized that the numbers were their rankings on the&nbsp;Global Godson Rankings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The highest-ranked was the young man who had just spoken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His name was Ray Luray, and he ranked 401st on the&nbsp;Global Godson Rankings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The lowest-ranked was the woman leading the group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emi Byrd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ranked 499.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From their seating order, it was clear that their status and position were entirely based on their rank in the&nbsp;Global Godson Rankings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The higher the rank, the better the seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, even Emi, the lowest-ranked, had her own seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Osborne and the others had to stand below the arena, looking up at them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"All right, the&nbsp;Global Godson Rankings Challenge Arena&nbsp;is officially open!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"All of you can challenge the Godsons&nbsp;above. If you defeat them, you'll take their rank, become a new Godson, and join the&nbsp;Global Godson Rankings."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, an elder appeared on the stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked over the crowd with a faint smile and said, "I'm Jackie Flores, an elder of the&nbsp;Diviner League. I'll be hosting today's challenge arena!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let the challenges begin!"</p><div class="pagination">
