  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne decided it was time to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before him lay a daunting sight: over 500 thousand Ferocious Beasts were swarming like ants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among these, the number of Class A and above Dark Exotic Beasts exceeded 50 thousand, charging toward the ten combat teams of the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne showed no signs of worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon Vanguard, the strongest squad, consisted of only a hundred warriors, but each of the other nine combat teams boasted over 500 members, all Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Equipped with powerful inner armor, advanced super energy guns, and the lifesaving Crystal of Life for quick recovery, these warriors were a formidable force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most crucial aspect? They worked together with seamless coordination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If one randomly assembled 500 Class S warriors without trust or teamwork, facing such an overwhelming Beast Tide would likely lead to chaos. They'd risk getting scattered and ultimately swallowed by the tide of beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Blood Demon members were different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were a cohesive unit, fully trusting each other to cover their backs. Even when faced with overwhelming odds&mdash;tenfold or more&mdash;they could retreat in an orderly fashion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the true strength of Blood Demon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne knew that if he didn't take action, even these skilled warriors would struggle to eliminate the 500 thousand Ferocious Beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Beast Tide was forming fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the watchful gaze of Osborne's Satan's Eye, he tracked the movements of the beasts. Two hundred thousand of them were closing in on the Blood Demon members, appearing fearless as they advanced but really just stalling for time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the remaining 30 thousand were gathering rapidly in the center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were intent on creating a genuine Beast Tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While a drop of water alone was insignificant, countless droplets could unite to form a devastating tide that obliterated everything in its path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne understood the danger: once those 30 thousand Ferocious Beasts combined, even the 48 hundred Blood Demon members wouldn't stand a chance. The difficulty of defeating the beasts would exponentially increase, and the tide's sheer power would force the warriors to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold smile, Osborne declared, "So, you want to form a Beast Tide?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too bad that won't happen!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia, Zoe, it's time for us to strike!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excited glints </span><span>shone in Anastasia and Zoe's eyes as they nodded, ready for action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne led the two women, using interdimensional travel to appear just over 10 miles away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They arrived at the center, where more than 50 thousand Ferocious Beasts had </span><span>already gathered, with even more converging rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air crackled with an ominous energy as the beasts pooled their ferocity. As Osborne and his companions approached, every beast snapped its gaze toward them, their bloodthirsty eyes sending a chill down Anastasia and Zoe's spines. For a brief moment, their color drained from their faces, fear gripping them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne remained calm, unwavering amidst the chaos. He didn't coddle Anastasia and Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't coddle Anastasia and Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had to acclimate to this brutal combat scenario; otherwise, they would falter like Viggo, Ariana, or Rihanna, who, under pressure, had panicked and failed to unleash their true potential. It was cutthroat out here, and fear had no place on a battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive horde of over 10 thousand flying Ferocious Beasts now charged towards Osborne and his two companions, Anastasia and Zoe, their intent plain&mdash;to rip them to shreds. Their fearless onslaught only served to further drain the color from Anastasia and Zoe's faces, their bodies quivering slightly under the sheer magnitude of the threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The psychological impact of a hundred beasts hurtling towards one was starkly different from ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And 10 thousand charging beasts? That was an entirely different beast altogether.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even seasoned warriors might falter in the face of such overwhelming terror, their limbs trembling and throats drying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But not Osborne; he stood firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay sharp!" Osborne calmly advised Anastasia and Zoe before stepping forward himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Destruction Orbs!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Disintegration Rays!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Space Collapse!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mental Shatter!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thunder of Judgment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's attack speed was astonishing; within the blink of an eye, the sky was a canvas of his assaults, each one devastatingly powerful. Like a hot knife through butter, his attacks effortlessly tore through the charging aerial beasts&mdash;disintegrating, obliterating, annihilating!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The exhilaration surged through Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mind-blowing spellcasting speed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt the difference from three months prior, a profound transformation. The fusion of his soul of powers with his body meant the stronger his body grew, the more potent his powers became.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was more, his spellcasting speed far surpassed that of ordinary metahumans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, Osborne hadn't fully appreciated these advancements. But this awakening </span><span>made it crystal clear. These power attacks had become as natural as breathing, manifesting instantly with a mere thought&mdash;ten times more potent than they were three months ago!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Should he engage an opponent of </span><span>equivalent status, his attacks would be underway while theirs were still in their embryonic stage, deciding the victor and the vanquished in that single moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne grinned with exhilaration. "Time to test the physical prowess!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
