  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne froze for a moment when he heard that, awkwardly rubbing his nose. "You guys already know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary shot him a glare and said, "Just because the Hudson family has fallen on hard times doesn't mean our intelligence network is entirely useless. Do you think we wouldn't know about something this big?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You went by the alias 'Theodore,' got ambushed by Kurt and his crew outside the Luminous Commerce Center, defeated him, kidnapped him, and demanded ten pieces of Ultimate Luminous Armor and three lightning-element Ultimate Divine Artifacts from his father, Trevor, in exchange for his release at Astral Wolf Peak. The whole Apocalypse City knows about it now. Let me guess&mdash;you're heading to Astral Wolf Peak now, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled and nodded. "Uncle Zachary, you're not planning to stop me, are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary frowned but didn't answer directly. Instead, he asked, "Do you realize that Kurt's father, Trevor, is a Supernal Deity King?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded casually. "Yeah, I know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And knowing that, you still went through with this? He's a Supernal Deity King! You kidnapped his son and even had the nerve to demand a ransom. That's insane!" Zachary's frown deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained calm as he spoke, "So what if he's a Supernal Deity King, Uncle Zachary? He's still just a person. Kurt was way too arrogant&mdash;it was about time someone taught him a lesson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary speechlessly retorted, "Everyone knows Kurt's a pompous jerk! Believe me, I'd love to put him in his place too. But his father is Trevor! He's the heir of the Baxter family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the Baxter family finds out your real identity, you'll be in deep trouble. Seriously, teaching Kurt a lesson and slipping away would've been one thing. If you'd kept your identity under wraps, even Trevor wouldn't have been able to do much about it. But you're using Kurt as leverage to extort ten pieces of Ultimate Luminous Armor and three lightning-element Ultimate Divine Artifacts?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are way too bold. Do you even know how much a single piece of Ultimate Luminous Armor costs? At least ten thousand Celestial Crystals! That's ten times the price of a Sanctum-Level Light Airship. Even for someone like Trevor, coughing up ten pieces would be a massive blow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary took a deep breath and asked seriously, "In this situation, do you really think he's going to let you off the hook so easily? Trust me, you do not want a Supernal Deity King coming after you. That's a nightmare you can't wake up from. Their power is terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you even considered what you'll do if Trevor corners you at Astral Wolf Peak? Do you have an escape plan? Have you thought about how to avoid being hunted down? What if Trevor decides Kurt's life isn't worth sparing yours and goes all out to kill you? What's your backup plan?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't have one. You're only a mid Deity King Level right now. Even if you were at the highest Deity King Level, you'd stand no chance against Trevor if he's determined to kill you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary's expression was grave as he spoke, "I'm telling you this not because I think you did something wrong&mdash;quite the opposite, actually. I think you did exactly what needed to be done. Kurt has been asking for trouble for a long time. You putting him in his place felt satisfying for all of us. But my advice is that either give Kurt a good beating and let him go, or finish him off entirely. Whatever you do, don't go to Astral Wolf Peak. Trevor's definitely set up a trap there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're Vivienne's kid. We don't want anything to happen to you. If it's the Ultimate Luminous Armor you want, your cousin Virgil has one. I'll take it from him for you. If he dares to say no, I'll knock some sense into him. As for the lightning-elemental Ultimate Divine Artifact, the Hudson family has one too. I'll dig it out for you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bottom line, whatever you want, the Hudson family can provide. Even if we don't have it right now, we uncles and aunts will do whatever it takes to get it for you. And if we can't, once your grandpa is back, he'll make it happen for sure. Just don't take unnecessary risks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Zachary finished speaking, Osborne felt genuinely moved. He could clearly sense Zachary's worry and care for him. There was no condescension or lecturing, just sincere concern and heartfelt advice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "He really believes I'm after the Ultimate Luminous Armor. He's even willing to take it from Virgil&mdash;his own son and the Hudson family's heir!" This warmth spread through him, making him feel deeply cared for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In truth, Osborne could understand Zachary's concern. After all, the person he was "extorting," Trevor, was a Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Osborne couldn't agree to Zachary's suggestion. What Osborne wanted wasn't the Luminous Armor. That was just a cover, a bargaining chip. What he truly desired was the Hammer of Thor&mdash;and only Trevor had it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's Thunder Power was the strongest Osborne had ever seen, far surpassing his own. He knew that if she could wield the Hammer of Thor, her strength would skyrocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stronger the wielder's Thunder Power, the greater the Hammer of Thor's potential. In anyone else's hands, it was just an ordinary Ultimate Divine Artifact. But in Anastasia's hands, it would become a weapon a hundred times more powerful than any other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could feel how much Anastasia yearned for the Hammer of Thor. That was why, no matter what, he had to secure it and give her a wonderful surprise.</span></p><div class="pagination">
