  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four figures encircled Osborne, each radiating formidable energy fluctuations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all Class A masters, one a power master, and three martial masters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Including Medusa No. 7, Osborne was now facing five Class A masters at the same time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I underestimated them! They had such an ambush hidden at the seabed. Medusa No. 7 deliberately lured me down here, leading me into their trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It might have been prepared for Ms. Hernandez, but she hasn't made a move yet, and I'm the one 'enjoying' it first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Various thoughts flashed through Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he wasn't overly worried. Such an encirclement might work for others. Even Serena would have to rely on her strength to break out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled faintly, "You think you can trap me like this? Too naive. I'm not playing with you. Now that I know your plan, it's time for me to leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne tore open a spatial rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He possessed space elemental power, able to escape through interdimensional travel even in danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enemies he faced were five Class A masters, two of them Class A Power Masters, and three Class A martial masters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such strength could sweep through most of the ancient families in Dampston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Paltrow, Walker, and Luther families might not be able to withstand it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with his confidence, Osborne didn't think he could handle five Class A masters. The best course of action was to leave immediately and inform Serena of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dimensional rift opened, and Osborne took a step forward, about to enter it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, his Satan's Eye began to twitch violently, warning him of danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression changed dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Satan's Eye had never been wrong in its warnings. He stepped back without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, the dimensional rift in front of him exploded with a bang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't stepped back but entered the rift just now, he would have been severely injured, if not killed, by the explosion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked sharply behind Medusa No. 7, where another figure had appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an older man, gaunt and leaning on a cane, walking at the seabed with all the seawater parting around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the power fluctuations around him were clearly not of a water elemental.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's nerves were taut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing the old man, Medusa and the other four men immediately bowed with respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Greetings, Mr. Turner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruce Turner nodded slightly, looking at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression was indifferent as he spoke slowly. "The space elemental power is indeed rare and elusive. If you were a Class A Power Master, even I would find it difficult to stop you from leaving through the dimensional passage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But unfortunately, you are not a Class A Power Master! In front of me, you have no chance of escape. Take off your skinmask. Let me see who you really are."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was extremely gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel Bruce's immense strength, definitely on the same level as Serena. Facing Medusa No. 7 and the others, Osborne was not afraid at all. Even if he couldn't win, he could still escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in front of Bruce, he couldn't even run away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne clenched his fists, saying coldly, "Want me to take off the skinmask? We'll see if you have what it takes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shape-shifting to Vampire!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this situation, Osborne dared not hold back any longer and immediately activated the power of the Blood Cross, transforming into a vampire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrifying power erupted within his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hair grew wildly, instantly becoming flowing long hair, each strand as blood-red as blood itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two sharp fangs sprouted in his mouth, and his fingers grew long, dagger-like nails.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face also turned pale and more angular.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Osborne launched an attack. His blood-red hair instantly grew to hundreds of feet in length, lashing out like whips toward Medusa No. 7 and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa No. 7's face was filled with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In front of Mr. Turner, you still dare to struggle. Mr. Turner doesn't need to move a finger; we can kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Medusa struck again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joining her were the other four Class A masters, one a water elemental metahuman, the others Class A martial masters, not inferior to Victor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's blood-red hair fluttered wildly but was repelled by their onslaught. Terrifying underwater currents battered his body. At the same time, Medusa No. 7 and three Class A martial masters rushed close to him, attacking his vital points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth, knowing that his martial art aura alone would definitely not hold against these attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The level six blue Devil's Light instantly enveloped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With several loud booms, heavy attacks landed on him, causing his Devil's Light to flicker violently. Although it wasn't broken, the immense force still penetrated through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face turned pale, blood seeping from the corner of his mouth instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The simultaneous attack of four Class A masters was still hard to withstand. Fortunately, his body was strong enough, and his level six Devil's Light and martial art aura blocked most of the attack's power, so he only suffered minor injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his expression remained extremely grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because the most terrifying enemy, Bruce, had not yet made an attack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I going to die here today?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
