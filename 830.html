  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was furious because someone had kidnapped Clarissa. Donna didn't explain what happened, so Osborne didn't know who took her. But he didn't care about the details. Clarissa was his girlfriend, and no matter who the kidnapper was, he was ready to fight them to the end.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without a second thought, Osborne flew into the sky, using the power of the Satan's Eye. From up high, he could see most of the city. It didn't take long for him to spot Ebony's convoy.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Inside a luxury car, Clarissa was seriously hurt under Ebony's control. Blood stained her mouth, and her face was pale.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing this made Osborne even angrier.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stop fighting!" Ebony sneered, "My brother is the heir of the Thornberry family. He's ranked 40th on the Godson Rankings, but his real strength is in the top 20, maybe even the top 10!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You won't find anyone better than my brother among the young people today. If you weren't the Fatebearer, you wouldn't even have a chance with him! Now, you're lucky to be chosen as his bride!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you try to fight back again, I'll have to knock you out and take you back to Marcelin."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa's response was icy, "I care not for your brother's power or his advantages. I will never marry him! I have a boyfriend, and you'd do well to either kill me now or let me go. If my boyfriend finds out, you'll regret it!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Ebony burst into laughter.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your boyfriend? You mean Osborne Augustine? He's quite the fighter, having bested all his rivals to become the first heir of the Augustine family.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But he's still leagues behind my brother!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Augustine family is no match for the Thornberry family! If we wished, we could crush the Augustine family without breaking a sweat!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Forget your boyfriend; he's nothing compared to my brother! He's not even worthy to lick my brother's boots!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony showed her arrogance.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa's anger flared at Ebony's insult towards Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I won't let you insult Osborne that way!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With all her strength, Clarissa lunged at Ebony.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instantly, Ebony fiercely slapped Clarissa.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony scoffed, "Still struggling? You truly have a death wish! What's wrong with me humiliating your boyfriend? What can you possibly do about it?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'd say the same to his face. He's a waste!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony's disdain was palpable.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But at that moment, a cold voice, laden with murderous intent, pierced the air, sending shivers down their spines.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing the voice, Clarissa felt a surge of surprise wash over her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony's expression shifted, but before she could react, her car came to an abrupt halt. A tall figure descended before them.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony glared at Osborne and let out an audible sneer as she pushed open the car door.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You must be Osborne, the boyfriend of the Fatebearer! Leave now! She is beyond the reach of a loser like you! Only someone like my brother can possess her and harness her fate power!" Ebony proclaimed arrogantly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's face was a mask of ice. "Who is your brother? And who might you be?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Ebony replied with pride, "Listen up and listen well! My brother is Marlon Thornberry, and I am Ebony Thornberry! We hail from the esteemed Thornberry family of Marcelin! If you have any sense, you'll leave this instant. I'm here for Clarissa, and I will not be denied!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you refuse to leave, I will ensure your departure myself!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A formidable aura erupted from Ebony's being.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, be on your guard; she is incredibly powerful and wields the Solar Realm!" Clarissa yelled with urgency.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne turned to Clarissa, stating, "Clarissa, do not fret. I am here, and I will not let anyone take you away. I will help you seek your vengeance."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He feigned surprise as his gaze shifted to Ebony.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Thornberry family from Marcelin? The lineage of Helios Thornberry?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony smiled at his words.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's good that you've heard of us! Helios Thornberry is my great-grandfather! Knowing him, you must also be familiar with the might of the Thornberry family. My brother is the heir apparent, and he has set his sights on your beloved Clarissa. He intends to bring her to Marcelin. If you possess any wisdom, leave now!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Should you choose otherwise, offending the Thornberry family is not a burden you can bear, nor can the entire Augustine family of Rosmandi. Even the Godfather of Rosmandi cannot withstand the wrath of my great-grandfather!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Therefore, I suggest you leave at once!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony's tone dripped with disdain.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne looked gloomy, and a storm of anger brewed within him. Yet, deep down, he recognized the truth in Ebony's arrogant declaration.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was, indeed, in no position to provoke the Thornberry family. Neither was the Augustine family nor could Sebastian weather the tempest that would follow such an affront!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Osborne felt the weight of his predicament.</p><div class="pagination">
