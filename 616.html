  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather obviously didn't want to talk much about his heir, so he urged Everett to hurry up and hand over the divine artifacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett had achieved his goal, so he didn't dwell on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grunted coldly. "Why are you so anxious? It's just two divine artifacts, and I won't break the contract!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Everett said so, a hint of concern still showed in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, he waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two bright lights were instantly revealed, shooting towards Godfather at breakneck speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather smiled calmly and waved his hand gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two bright lights instantly stopped in front of him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked over curiously, wanting to see what the two divine artifacts were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, the two divine artifacts quickly disappeared and were put away by Godfather, so everyone didn't get a good look at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everett, it's going to become quite chaotic in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>. I should thank you for providing us with the divine artifacts." Godfather smiled faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett curled his lips and stood up angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sebastian, don't get overjoyed too early! I'm just temporarily leaving two divine artifacts with you, and you'll get them back to me sooner or later!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, I hope I get a chance to come to your birthday party next year, so you must live a long time. You can't die by accident, and I don't want to come to your funeral!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett seemed to be blessing Godfather, but in fact, he was cursing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather, however, didn't take it to heart. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled faintly, "You don't need to worry about it. As long as you're alive, I'll definitely live well. At least I will die after attending your funeral."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? We'll see about that. I'm going to see who is the first to hold the funeral! Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett waved his hand and led the Rosenthal family away. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These people looked reluctant and furious, and each one of them gave Osborne a fierce look as they left before turning to walk out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes were filled with a ruthless murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Osborne seemed calm and completely unafraid of Everett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Everett left the Augustine Estate with those people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned around and looked at the people behind him and grunted coldly. "You're all losers! This was a must-win bet, but I lost because of you guys, and I lost two divine artifacts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria, Aresta, and the others lowered their heads upon hearing this, looking so aggrieved that they didn't dare to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Palmers, who had woken up and said furiously at this moment, "Grandpa, I won&rsquo;t admit defeat! I didn't even have time to exert my power. If I do it again, I can definitely win, and I will definitely kill Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett snorted upon hearing this, "Do you want to do it again? Who'll give you the chance to do it again? I told you not to be arrogant, and there are countless geniuses in this world. You're still far from invincible, so you can't underestimate anyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Palmers bit his lips tightly, and he still felt angry and reluctant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, I will definitely take revenge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Palmers' eyes were filled with hatred. "I'm going to kill Osborne and the whole Augustine family, and I'll make them pay for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett smiled calmly upon hearing this, "Do you want revenge? You still have a chance, and you're going to make it happen. The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> will soon return to </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, and when they do, they'll start a war for </span><span>Rosmandi's</span><span> underworld!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sebastian's nasty Draco Group controls all of the rare metals in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, and he turned us down. Since they're involved in the rare metal business in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, there's no need for the Augustine family to exist!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Palmers was shocked to hear that, and he said in surprise, "Grandpa, do you mean that the Rosenthal family will help the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> attack the Augustine family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett smiled calmly, "We definitely need to help them, but we have to do it secretly. If you want revenge, I can send you to the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> and disguise yourself as one of their members, and you can kill a few more people from the Augustine family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Palmers was instantly surprised to hear that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, I'm going to join the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>. I'm going to kill Osborne and destroy the Augustine family with my own hands!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked back in the direction of the Augustine family and sneered, "The Augustine family will be doomed. Sebastian is old, and he can't stand up to the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> this time! Everything will change in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> soon! The great battle of the dark world is about to break out, and everything is going to be chaotic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Everett turned around and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other side, Godfather's birthday party continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather never mentioned the fight again, as if he had forgotten about it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only when his birthday party was over, and everyone was ready to leave that Godfather said once again, "All the elders of the Augustine family and the six recognized heirs will stay behind, and I need to make an announcement."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent, Matthew, and the others were shocked, and their eyes were filled with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the others all left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were less than a hundred people left in the hall of the birthday party.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elders of the Augustine family looked calm, and they seemed to have known what Godfather was going to announce, so they just stood by silently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The six recognized heirs, including Vincent, Matthew, Owen, Emma, Lance, and Osborne, were all looking at Godfather with great excitement at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They probably knew what Godfather had left them behind to announce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps the real heir selection was about to begin from now on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, all six of them were incredibly excited.</span></p><div class="pagination">
