  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne staggered, feeling the immense force from Paul&rsquo;s hand, as though he had been squeezed by an elephant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He couldn&rsquo;t help but frown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ignoring Osborne, Paul said to Clarissa, &ldquo;Ms. Radcliffe, the enemy&rsquo;s attack is too intense. I will take you to the safe house now.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Take him with us,&rdquo; she said hurriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She stared at Osborne&rsquo;s shoulder with concern. &ldquo;Osborne, are you injured? Come with us to the safe house. We&rsquo;ll be safe upon arriving there.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Before Osborne could speak, Paul said coldly, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, he ordered Osborne, &ldquo;Remain here to hold off the enemy and buy time for Ms. Radcliffe. Don&rsquo;t retreat. Reinforcements are on their way.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He held up the riot shield, ready to protect Clarissa to the north.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne frowned at his words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Hold off the enemy? Buy time? Sorry, why should I listen to you?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul narrowed his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He said threateningly, &ldquo;I am the captain of Ms. Radcliffe&rsquo;s bodyguards. In an emergency, I have the authority to command all of her bodyguards to fight. Do you dare disobey my orders?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne smiled, &ldquo;You are mistaken about one thing. I&rsquo;m not yet Ms. Radcliffe&rsquo;s bodyguard. Therefore, as the captain, you can&rsquo;t give me orders.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was reluctant to entrust Clarissa to Paul because he didn&rsquo;t trust Paul, or rather, he didn&rsquo;t trust anyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her safety was crucial to his test of heirship. Only by personally safeguarding her could he find peace of mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul&rsquo;s gaze turned icy. Swiftly, he lifted his gun and aimed it at Osborne&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;How dare you defy my orders? Believe it or not, I will consider you an enemy and eliminate you on the spot. I have reason to believe you might be a spy.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Facing the black muzzle, Osborne was instantly annoyed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He narrowed his eyes and said coldly, &ldquo;Give it a try.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Do you think I won&rsquo;t?&rdquo; Paul sneered, brimming with murderous intent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Anxiously, Clarissa shouted, &ldquo;Captain Paul, I command you to cease. Osborne is not a spy. He just saved my life. Therefore, I order you to put down your gun at once.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul was taken aback by her chilly and stern voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, Osborne glanced into the distance and furrowed his brow. &ldquo;If we continue arguing like this, the enemies will catch up. Where&rsquo;s the safe house? I&rsquo;ll escort you there.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul met Clarissa&rsquo;s angry eyes and finally moved his gun away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He scoffed, &ldquo;Three hundred yards north.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He prepared to take Clarissa away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Three hundred yards north?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was momentarily stunned, his Satan&rsquo;s Eye scanning to the north. He became nervous and urgently grabbed Clarissa&rsquo;s arm with a straight face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Wait. We can&rsquo;t go there. There are enemies lying in ambush.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Clarissa exclaimed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul snapped, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense, you bastard. That&rsquo;s the safe house guarded by my people. How could there be enemies?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Are you a spy, deliberately trying to delay time and prevent Ms. Radcliffe from reaching the safe house? I am very suspicious of you. Why did the attack occur now? Could it be because of you?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul stared at Osborne with doubts and vigilance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even Clarissa was slightly swayed. The attack had come suddenly and violently this time. The guards outside hadn&rsquo;t issued any warning, and the enemies had approached her directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was impossible that no one inside revealed her location.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But how could it be Osborne?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa didn&rsquo;t believe that he was a spy. He had indeed risked his life, darting into a hail of bullets to retrieve a riot shield solely to protect her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The gunshot injury in his shoulder was still bleeding&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Had he been a spy, there would have been no need for him to act in such a manner, and he would have had ample chances to end her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Am I a spy?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne sneered, &ldquo;I warned you about an enemy ambush three hundred yards to the north. Believe it or not, you shouldn&rsquo;t go there.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Well, get out of here,&rdquo; Paul growled before pushing Osborne away rudely and dashing north with Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After a moment of hesitation, Osborne still followed them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Along the way, he ran into another unconscious bodyguard and retrieved a pistol. He caught up with Clarissa while shooting at the back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even in inclement weather, his marksmanship remained remarkably accurate, knocking down an enemy with every shot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Unfortunately, due to the overwhelming number of enemies, he couldn&rsquo;t eliminate them all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity that I didn&rsquo;t bring my Draco Model H mini-handgun. Otherwise, I might have had a chance to kill them all.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">While the pistols provided by the Radcliffe family for the bodyguards were potent, each magazine held only ten rounds. In most general dangers, the bullets were certainly sufficient.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, in the current situation, no matter how skilled Osborne was with his marksmanship, ten bullets could only murder ten enemies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was far from enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Moreover, the enemies possessed night vision equipment, which rendered them less hindered by the harsh conditions. Upon realizing Osborne&rsquo;s formidable shooting skills, they advanced cautiously with the help of cover.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It became more challenging for him to kill the enemies.</p><div class="pagination">
