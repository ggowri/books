  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the members from the Blood Demon Organization, Osborne seemed calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go ahead! You've trained for over ten years or even decades just to fight! Today is your first battle, so don't let me down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne told the members of the Blood Demon Organization once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A furious intent to fight appeared in the eyes of the members from the Blood Demon Organization. Without hesitation, they immediately transformed into the Blood Clan and attacked the headquarters in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a rumble, the war began!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb and Janet stood by Osborne's side, looking incredibly gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, aren't we going to attack?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just saw at least three of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> across the street have reached Class AAA. Although the Blood Demon Organization is formidable, the most powerful of them only have reached Class AA. If we just rely on them to attack, maybe they can't do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said calmly, "We don't need to attack for now. This is the first battle for the Blood Demon Organization, and I hope that they can overcome a strong opponent on their own. It will be truly difficult, but I believe they can do it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"None of them are capable enough to fight against someone who has reached Class AAA, but if they join forces, Class AAA warriors might not stop them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remembered the first time he went to the Training Base No. 6 and was sieged by No. 1 and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He almost died that time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over five hundred members from the Blood Demon Organization had trained together for over a decade or even decades. They worked incredibly well together, and their power was maximized when they joined forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched the battle seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa stood beside Osborne, holding a divine artifact in her hands, which was named the Fate Staff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the sound of rumbling, the battle between the Blood Demon Organization and the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> had finally begun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the attack of countless battle drones and battle robots, the first line of defense at the headquarters in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> was broken down. The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> sent out a large number of Count Medusa, Count Titan and Count Werewolves in an attempt to defend the members from the Blood Demon Organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them had the power of a Class A master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were more than a hundred of them, and several of them were Marquis masters who had reached Class AA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was formidable enough, but the members of the Blood Demon Organization were even more powerful. The three attacking teams kept attacking like a wave, cooperating with each other. When they attacked for the first time, a large swath of the enemy fell down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miserable screams rang out to give people chills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the battlefield, a strong blood energy filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just one attack, at least dozens of Class A marquis members from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> were knocked down, seriously injured, or even killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Blood Demon Organization also suffered a bit of damage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They also suffered casualties, but Clarissa was behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa had already gotten ready. When she realized that the members of the Blood Demon Organization were injured, she immediately executed the divine healing. Pure white light fell on the injured members from the Blood Demon Organization, quickly healing their injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as they didn't get killed instantly, Clarissa could save them back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They worked well together and helped each other. Even if the enemy tried to kill them instantly, it was too hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne had a hard time doing that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a rumbling sound, they shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fierce battles continued to break out, and the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> obviously didn't expect the Blood Demon Organization to be so powerful, and that the number of people who had reached Class AA or Class A was even greater than theirs. They also didn't realize that the cooperation of the Blood Demon Organization was so perfect, and that they would even be healed after they were injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this case, the Blood Demon Organization had the irresistible force to destroy their enemies. They rushed into the headquarters in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> and started a bloody massacre.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the leaders of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, Duke Medusa, Duke Titan and Duke Werewolf were all dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could that happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where did these warriors come from? Have all five hundred of them reached Class A or higher?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Our information was wrong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't wait any longer. The three of us will attack together to kill them all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Duke Medusa began her attack instantly after she finished speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She </span><span>screamed,</span><span> her eyes filled with a light of death that enveloped several members from the Blood Demon Organization at the forefront.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ghost Petrification!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a crack, the bodies of several members from Blood Demon Organization who were enveloped by Ghost Petrification were instantly petrified into stone carvings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Duke Medusa's Ghost Petrification was nothing ordinary. Even if Osborne used his martial art aura, he wouldn't completely resist it, and he'd be petrified halfway through his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could stop the members from the Blood Demon Organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as they were petrified and Medusa was about to kill them, a pure white light fell on them again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the petrification effect was removed from them, and they quickly dodged Duke Medusa's attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was still Clarissa who attacked them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her divine healing was not only able to heal injuries, but also remove negative states.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Duke Medusa instantly looked shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly looked at Clarissa in the distance, her eyes filled with insane killing intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Duke Titan No. 8, Duke Werewolf No. 8, we have to team up and kill that damn woman. Otherwise, as long as she's around, all of us will die here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Duke Titan and Duke Werewolf looked at each other and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's kill them first!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
