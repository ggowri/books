It didn't answer his question but merely </span><span>repeated its demand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave the items behind! Leave the items behind!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave the items behind!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at the Shadow Terror Fiend in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It has no intelligence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought crossed his mind, and for a moment, he hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne couldn't bring himself to part with the precious Celestial Crystals or the withered root.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both were incredibly valuable to him, hard-won treasures he wasn't about to relinquish just because the Shadow Terror Fiend commanded it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even as the overwhelming power of the Shadow Terror Fiend made him feel utterly helpless, he refused to comply!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a determined bite of his teeth, Osborne activated interdimensional travel once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he stepped into the dimensional portal, he felt a sudden, violent tremor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The portal shattered under the force of the Shadow Terror Fiend's arm, collapsing in on itself before crashing down upon him. Osborne summoned every ounce of his divine power to defend himself. His defenses, enhanced by his powerful divine energy and his Level Nine Divine Body, were stronger than any ordinary Deity King's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His natural defenses were far beyond what his Spatial Clones could muster!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, his divine power defense crumpled like tissue paper before the Shadow Terror Fiend's onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then came the shattering of his Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though his Level Nine Divine Body absorbed some of the force, it, too, fell apart under the Shadow Terror Fiend's terrifying strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne exploded into a mist of blood, his demise as swift and certain as a hammer crushing an ant</span><span>. No doubt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt the cold grip of death enveloped him, yet he was not truly gone. Thanks to the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, he had achieved a sixth-layer fusion that granted him a complete immortal form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though his body and soul had been shattered, he could resurrect himself, choosing any time or place to return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this strange state of "half-death," Osborne's fragmented consciousness opted not to revive immediately. Instead, he observed the Shadow Terror Fiend, which, after obliterating him, began to scour the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The creature searched high and low, but after a fruitless hunt, its frustration boiled over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waves of raw energy surged from its body</span><span>, </span><span>swe</span><span>pt</span><span> in all directions</span><span>, </span><span>and annihilating everything in its path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank goodness! It seems like it lacks intelligence and hasn't figured out that I'm not truly dead! If it did, with its power, I'd be finished for good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression turned grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What exactly is the Shadow Terror Fiend? What does it want me to leave behind? The withered root? Is that what it severed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pondered these questions as the Shadow Terror Fiend, having vented its rage, finally departed, </span><span>and </span><span>vanish</span><span>ed</span><span> from his sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of relief washed over Osborne, but he didn't rush to revive himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided to wait, biding his time for two full days to ensure the Shadow Terror Fiend had truly left before making his move. Only then did he choose to resurrect.</span></p><div class="pagination">
