  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Just go!&rdquo; Ophelia finally said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Justin&rsquo;s face paled. &ldquo;No, we absolutely can&rsquo;t let him go.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Once Osborne left, he would no longer have a way to prove the explosives on him were fake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Ophelia sneered, &ldquo;Justin, remember your place. I am now the heir to the Caldwell family.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Justin was seething and angry, unable to speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Justin, you better mind your own business. If I find out you ever tried to poison me or had your bodyguard attempt to kill me, you know what will happen.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Justin&rsquo;s face grew even more gloomy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He glared at Osborne, his eyes seething with murderous intent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia also looked at Osborne, coldly saying, &ldquo;You win. But you better not fall into my hands again. The Caldwell family&rsquo;s money isn&rsquo;t easy to take. Be careful. It might burn you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne shrugged. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t worry about that. If I dared to take it, I&rsquo;m not afraid of getting burned.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, Osborne wasted no more words and walked towards the villa&rsquo;s exit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Caldwell family members stepped aside, no one daring to stop him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ophelia, are you really letting that scoundrel walk away? That&rsquo;s twenty million dollars! How will you explain to The Wise Order?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evelyn watched Osborne&rsquo;s disappearing figure, grinding her teeth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia shook her head. &ldquo;Evelyn, I can&rsquo;t risk it. If the explosives were real, it would only benefit Justin. I had to let Osborne go. As for The Wise Order, I&rsquo;ll explain it to them. The Caldwell family&rsquo;s money isn&rsquo;t easy to take. I will settle accounts with him sooner or later.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia&rsquo;s face remained grim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She felt deeply humiliated by Osborne, a so-called useless person who had extorted twenty million dollars in cash from her as if she had been slapped several times. How could she not be furious?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This vendetta must be avenged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He would pay with his life for the money he took.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evelyn opened her mouth to speak but ultimately said nothing, a flash of anger and embarrassment in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, Osborne had left the Caldwell Manor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Once he was far enough, he started to run frantically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I did it. It really worked&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Despite Osborne always appearing calm, only he knew how panicked he truly was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Especially when Penelope said the explosives on him were fake, his heart nearly leaped out of his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Fortunately, he had managed to deceive Ophelia using his wits.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If she had been more decisive, he would have been doomed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After all, the explosives were indeed fake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was just an ordinary man. Where would he get real explosives? It was all a bluff to intimidate Ophelia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Fortunately, his plan worked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Time to collect my reward. I wonder what the Godfather will give me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But how should he contact the Godfather?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As Osborne pondered this, he saw a motorcycle speeding towards him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A striking woman with a red and black helmet sat on the imposing motorcycle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although her face was not visible, her long legs, firm and round buttocks, and graceful curves indicated that she was undoubtedly a great beauty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Yet, Osborne felt a faint threat from this motorcycle beauty for some reason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His expression changed, and he hurriedly ducked into the roadside woods.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But before he could hide, the motorcycle suddenly accelerated, performed an impressive drift right in front of him, and came to a stop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The woman stopped there with her long legs and smoothly removed her helmet. Her wavy hair flowed freely, revealing a gorgeously beautiful face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She smiled, teasingly looking at Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Kid, why run upon seeing me? Is that all the courage you have? Weren&rsquo;t you brave back at the Caldwell Manor, scaring people with fake explosives?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s expression changed, and he said warily, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;m not with the Caldwell family.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The woman smiled lightly. &ldquo;My name is Isa Bowin, and I am a doctor. People call me the Night Witch. By the way, I was sent by the Godfather to deliver your reward.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Night Witch?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hearing that she was there to deliver his reward, Osborne perked up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the reward?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Isa smiled slightly, puffed up her ample chest, and, pointing to her beautiful face, said, &ldquo;The reward is me. How about that? Are you satisfied with this reward? You can do whatever you want with me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Godfather rewarded him with a woman?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He gazed at Isa&rsquo;s face, impressed by her beauty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was indeed gorgeous and well-formed, though Osborne couldn&rsquo;t understand why such a beautiful girl, who was also a doctor, would be nicknamed Night Witch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But to be rewarded with a woman felt somewhat undervalued to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What he needed most now was wealth, power, something to change his circumstances, not a gorgeous woman with whom he could do as he pleased in bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With this thought, Osborne sighed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But since the reward was a woman, he couldn&rsquo;t really complain, and he began to appraise her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing this, Isa glared at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Young man, you seem dissatisfied with me? Humph, you&rsquo;re not qualified yet to have me as your prize.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, Isa pulled a smartwatch from her bag and casually tossed it to Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Here, your real reward is in this.&rdquo;</p><div class="pagination">
