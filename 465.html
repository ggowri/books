His head drooped down, and the life in his eyes quickly disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, who was born with strange phenomena and was known as the number one genius in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, died just like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps, this is really the backlash of the fate power..." Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who wanted to marry Clarissa, from Apollo to Orion and then to Alexander, all ended up dying in his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they didn't want to marry Clarissa, perhaps they wouldn't have died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything seemed to be destined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will I also be devoured by the fate power in the future?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly shook his head and stopped thinking about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He put Alexander's body into the Dimensional Space and looked at Wade, whose eyes were filled with fear. Wade tried hard to get up, but he couldn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne walking towards him, he showed anger and hatred on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you destroyed my family, and you'll be punished! Someone will avenge my family. I will be waiting for you in hell!!" Wade roared madly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, "Then you just wait."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Osborne slapped down from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade's entire body was beaten into pieces of flesh, which flew everywhere, splashing on Evelynn, Charlie, and others, making them scream in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn stared at Osborne angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't bother to pay attention to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had it not been for Evelynn, a descendant of the Augustine family in Newport City and a relative of his, he would've sent her to hell with a slap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked up the lightning staff that Wade dropped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lightning staff was the Paltrow family's most potent ancient magic weapon, ranking at level four and surpassing all others Osborne had encountered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It could amplify the power of thunder and lightning and was also helpful to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he didn't use it himself, it would fetch an astonishing price at an auction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne put it into the Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he looked at Evelynn and the other four coldly. "Why don't you get out of here right now?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn got enraged upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had stood up and growled, "Okay! Fine! I have never suffered such a big loss since I was born! I will remember this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just wait! This is not over yet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn wanted to leave with Charlie and others furiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie and others also glared at Osborne, with hatred in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne saw that, his face suddenly turned cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dare to glare at me? You just want to receive a good beat, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Osborne slapped them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn and Charlie's expressions shifted abruptly. But it was too late for them to resist. They were immediately dealt a blow by Osborne and sent reeling back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All five of them fell to the ground in a mess, rolling over and over for more than a dozen times before stopping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the injuries were not serious, the feeling of humiliation drove them almost crazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who were they?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all descendants of ancient families in Newport City, with the Caldwell and Hayes families being the most prominent and far superior to the Paltrow family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn was even a descendant of Newport City's Augustine family, the oldest family in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were geniuses in the Power Prodigy Class and the most dazzling existence of the younger generation. Even in Newport City, where there were so many masters, no one dared to treat them like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, they were humiliated by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn's eyes turned red, mist covering her eye sockets, and she stared at Osborne angrily as if she wanted to eat him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "Girl, you still dare to look at me like this? It seems you need more lessons! Do you really think that since you are a descendant of the Augustine family in Newport City, no one dares to deal with you? I will!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne then stretched out his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the power of his mind control surged, and Evelynn's body flew up. She flew in front of Osborne and was strangled by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at her with cold, murderous intent flashing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn struggled violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Asshole, let me go! If you dare to touch me again, I will kill you! The Augustine family will kill you!" Evelynn yelled anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you survive until now when you are so annoying? Since your elders didn't educate you well, I will do that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be so arrogant when you're out and about!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, it's easy to get yourself killed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne then slapped Evelynn hard in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn's pretty face swelled up instantly, her head buzzing from the beating, and she almost fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne didn't stop but slapped her hard many more times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was stunned when they saw Osborne's actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But seeing the murderous intent in Osborne's eyes, they dared not stop him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Osborne stopped and left Evelynn, who had been knocked unconscious, next to Charlie and others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take her away now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't show up in front of me again, or I'll beat you up every time I see you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, Charlie and the others shivered suddenly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They sized up Osborne silently but refrained from harsh words, promptly helping Evelynn to her feet and departing.</span></p><div class="pagination">
