  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apocalypse Harbinger's expression darkened, his face tightening with a mix of concern and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not only does he wield spatial power, but he also commands time power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the words left his lips, both Nelson and Emperor Dare exchanged startled glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? How is that even possible? Spatial power and time power are incredibly rare; mastering either one is a lifetime achievement. To possess both? This is absurd! Is he some kind of prodigy, a child of destiny?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes gleamed with envy and jealousy as they wished they could swap places with Osborne and claim his powers for themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, beneath their astonishment, they remained calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They believed that no matter how formidable Osborne was, he wouldn't escape this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the foes Osborne had dispatched were merely Superior Deities. It seemed he was deliberately avoiding the Transcendent Deities of Lord League, indicating that he lacked the confidence to take them out in a single strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And if Osborne couldn't eliminate them swiftly, he would inevitably be ensnared and overwhelmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that case, no matter how strong he was, death awaited him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh, we'd better deal with this freak sooner rather than later. Otherwise, he'll become a thorn in our side, jeopardizing Lord Malevolence's plans to dominate </span><span>Celestara</span><span>," Nelson said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he seemed to forget he was a human deity, his thoughts entirely aligned with the Dark Deities, eager to eliminate the threat Osborne posed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apocalypse Harbinger noticed this and smiled with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry; he can't escape! My men have completely surrounded this area and have used special techniques to freeze the surrounding space. While they can't fully prevent him from using his spatial power, if he tries to flee, he'll be stopped dead in his tracks!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's as good as dead. Let's just sit back and enjoy the show. I've never seen anyone wield both spatial and time power; I'm curious to see just how far he can push it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Apocalypse Harbinger showed no intention of intervening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the sixty-plus warriors from Lord League had already lost a dozen or so of their number to Osborne, but they were all just Superior Deities. Osborne was avoiding the Transcendent Deities, not because he couldn't take them out, but because it was simply easier to eliminate the Superior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his current strength, the Superior Deities were like ordinary people in his eyes. Once he locked onto a target, their fate was sealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the battle continued, fear began to creep into the hearts of the Lord League warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's speed was uncanny, like a ghost, making it nearly impossible to pin him down as he struck them down one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a desperate bid for survival, the remaining Superior Deities huddled together, hoping that their numbers would provide enough defense against Osborne's relentless assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, over thirty of them gathered, forming a united front.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Osborne didn't flinch; instead, a smile broke across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perfect! I was getting tired of picking you off one by one. Since you've all decided to cluster together, I'll send you all on your way at once!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he suddenly appeared not far from them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with the gathered group of over thirty Superior Deities, Osborne showed no hesitation. He launched a powerful kick toward them, unleashing a terrifying wave of divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive divine power imprint blotted out the sky as it hurtled down toward the group, ready to engulf them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brace yourselves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Block it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With over thirty of us working together, not even a peak Transcendent Deity can harm us, let alone kill us! I don't believe his single attack can touch us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold the line!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than thirty Superior Deities of the Lord League stood firm, their confidence unshaken. They failed to grasp the gravity of their situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "After all, the incomplete cosmic laws of Blue Planet limit cultivation to Transcendent Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With our combined might, a Transcendent Deity warrior can't possibly harm us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, their defensive formation braced as Osborne's powerful kick landed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, their defenses crumbled. The devastating force swept through, their Divine Bodies bursting like balloons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a blink, thirty-plus Transcendent Deity warriors exploded into a bloody mist, leaving behind only their shattered illusions of invincibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were gone&mdash;vanished from existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's single, devastating move obliterated more than thirty fully-defended Superior Deities in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battlefield was eerily quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes fixated on the thick fog of blood, the spot where dozens of Superior Deities had vanished, and Osborne, standing in the void like a god of war.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indescribable astonishment swept over everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Apocalypse Harbinger's face contorted with fear.</span></p><div class="pagination">
