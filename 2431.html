  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt the urgency of time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "The Magma Devourer entering the glacier zone will surely limit its power; it can no longer be so dominant. Mr. Norton is, after all, an Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warrior. Plus, he has the support of other judges. In such a situation, they probably won't need reinforcements to injure the Magma Devourer!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Magma Devourer's entire body is a treasure! If I get the chance, I must take it down myself&mdash;I can't let anyone else have it!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But before that, I'll keep hunting Ice Beetles! As long as Mr. Norton isn't foolish, he'll surely find a way to lure the Magma Devourer deeper into the glacier zone to further suppress its power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll strike when the time is right!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, Osborne took Clara and Leroy to continue hunting Ice Beetles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One day passed quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was the sixth day of the zone duel and Osborne's second day in the glacier zone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as he predicted, as he became more skilled with Time Retrace, finding Ice Beetles' nests became easier. Their harvest that day was greater than the previous day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A total of 800,000 Ice Beetles!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Each of you gets 160,000!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After distributing the spoils, Osborne wasted no time and began a new day of hunting.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he could already feel the glacier trembling. He knew that the Magma Devourer and Gerald were quickly approaching.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He spent some time getting closer and took a distant look at their battle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "The Magma Devourer is indeed injured!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, its injuries aren't severe enough! It's still powerful. Mr. Norton and the other judges can't even suppress it. If I go up now, it would be suicide!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he continued deeper into the glacier region.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A day passed quickly. That day, his gains were fewer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There are 600,000 Ice Beetles!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Each of you has 120,000!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy and Clara were already somewhat used to it by now. Each of them had 100,000 Ice Beetles on the first day, 160,000 on the second day, and 120,000 today...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In three days, each of them obtained 380,000 Ice Beetles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These are worth 760 million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adding the over 84 million Leroy and Clara had previously obtained, their total haul has now reached an astonishing 844 million, heading toward a billion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were no longer excited about this and had gradually become numb.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara asked in confusion, "Osborne, we've gone deeper into the glacier area. Logically, there should be more Ice Beetles here, so why is today's haul less than before?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought for a moment and explained, "Because several Ice Beetle nests I found were empty! They were startled awake early and had already left their nests.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It must have been caused by the battle between the Magma Devourer, Mr. Norton, and the other judges! Their fight was too intense. Even from a great distance, it created terrifying vibrations. </span><span>So</span><span> most of the Ice Beetles were startled awake and have already fled their nests."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So that's it! Did they go into hiding?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara understood. Then, she curiously asked, "So where did these Ice Beetles escape to? Could they have all gone to the same place? If we find their hiding spot, can we catch them all at once?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wouldn't that be easier than us painstakingly searching for their nests?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne instantly became excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He smiled at Clara. "Clara, you're absolutely right! The Ice Beetles leaving their nests might very likely go to the same place they consider safe to hide! If we find them, we might indeed be able to catch them all at once and solve the problem once and for all!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If we really find that place, you'll have made a great contribution!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, he couldn't wait any longer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go! We'll search right now and see where they've been hiding!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara saw Osborne's excited expression and smiled slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Whether I make a contribution or not doesn't matter! We've already taken too much advantage of you, yet we can hardly help you! If I can really help you this time, I'll feel a bit more at ease."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After she finished speaking, the three of them mounted their horses and galloped away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne found an Ice Beetles' nest, but it was already empty. There had been tens of thousands of Ice Beetles inside, but they had quickly left not long ago.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it were someone else, they might find it hard to track these Ice Beetles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ice Beetles fly in the air, leaving almost no traces. Even if there are traces, they are quickly covered by snow and cold wind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne has Time Retrace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After using Time Retrace, he immediately saw the scene of the Ice Beetles leaving and the direction they went. He quickly had Flash follow that direction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Along the way, Osborne kept using Time Retrace to adjust the direction. After many twists and turns, they gradually arrived at the eastern side of the glacier region.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, through Time Retrace, he could see more groups of Ice Beetles appearing here. After gathering together, they continued heading east.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"East?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned. The eastern side of the glacier region is right next to the volcanic area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"These Ice Beetles wouldn't be seeking refuge in the volcanic area, would they? Although they're not afraid of high temperatures, they do prefer the cold..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Forget it, let's catch up first!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash was very fast. Osborne quickly noticed that they had caught up with a group of Ice Beetles, and this group was massive, numbering over 200,000.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt very excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This must be several Ice Beetle groups merged together! They're also heading east to seek refuge, but they fell behind."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then let's take them out while we're at it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne patted Flash's head and fed him a Beast Soul Flower.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Beast Soul Flower is the favorite food of the Beast Clan, and Flash is no exception. After eating the Beast Soul Flower, his strength rapidly increases, and he also experiences a sense of pleasure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he felt very satisfied.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took Osborne's favor, so naturally, he had to do the job well for him. Flash quickly took action, spewing out blue Freeze Dragon's Breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over two hundred thousand Ice Beetles combined are incredibly terrifying. Even a group of Empyrean Sacredness warriors would likely avoid them and quickly flee.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But for Flash, these Ice Beetles were just fragile bugs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud roar, the icy blue Dragon's Breath engulfed the swarm, freezing them instantly. Then, they fell like hail and were swiftly absorbed by Osborne into Satan Space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, over two hundred thousand Ice Beetles were killed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Keep chasing!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There are more Ice Beetles ahead. Hurry up and take care of them all!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne drove Flash to continue the pursuit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, they arrived at the edge of the glacier region. The temperature began to rise, and the glaciers became extremely sparse. They could even see volcanoes in the distance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne discovered a large number of Ice Beetles.</span></p><div class="pagination">
