  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac was utterly shocked. He was sure that Osborne, who had fought Brad five days ago, was not yet a Class A martial master. He couldn't imagine how Osborne could have broken through in just five days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To attempt and succeed at becoming a Class A martial master within five days was unheard of, an impossible feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What shocked Isaac the most was that after Osborne broke through to become a Class A martial master, his power was incredibly stable, as if he had been at that level for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could this person not be Osborne?" Isaac began to doubt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly. If Isaac knew he had actually succeeded in breaking through to Class A in just two days, he might be even more shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Isaac, I'll explain all this to you later. Anyway, leave her to me. Go help the others! The Aberrants' methods can't be so simple. We must keep cautious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac calmed down, nodded, and finally stopped insisting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five days ago, Osborne had not been a Class A martial master, yet he had easily defeated Brad. Now that he had broken through, his strength must have soared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't even sure if he could win against Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And with Osborne's space elemental metahuman power, even if he couldn't defeat the enemy, he could escape safely. Isaac was no longer worried about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be careful! If you really can't beat her, don't push it. Preserve your life first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Isaac left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gazed at the woman before him. She bore an uncanny resemblance to Medusa, right down to their identical power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But upon closer inspection, there were differences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This realization brought a sigh of relief to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this woman was truly Medusa, that would be a nightmare. It would imply that Medusa possessed the power of resurrection, making her an invincible force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as she could be killed, things were manageable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold tone, Osborne said, "Are you from the Aberrants? Your power is petrification, isn't it? I've encountered another individual with the same petrification power. She was also from the Aberrants and shared your demeanor, but she was killed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman raised an eyebrow at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you referring to Medusa No. 9? She went on a mission to Rosmandi not long ago, but it ended in failure, and she didn't make it out alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Medusa No. 9? So there are many Medusas in the Aberrants? You all possess the same petrification power? Are you sisters? And which number are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne fired off several questions in a row.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no hurry to attack, the woman responded with a smile, "You've asked me so many questions, but why should I answer you? Unless you can answer my questions as well. Let's make a trade, shall we?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated, then nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, ladies first. You answer my questions first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman replied calmly, "Is that how 'ladies first' works?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged. "What else could it be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, it's okay. It's not exactly a secret. We do have many Medusas. We are not sisters, but we do share the same petrification power. The difference lies in the strength of our powers. The stronger the power, the lower the number. And I am Medusa No. 7."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Medusa No. 7? So your strength surpasses that of Medusa No. 9?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned grave, pondering, "There are multiple Medusas in the Aberrants and they are not sisters. How is this possible? The stronger they are, the lower their number?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa No. 9 was already a Class A Power Master. That means at least nine Medusas in the Aberrants are Class A Power Masters. Maybe even more?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa No. 7 smiled faintly, "Now it's my turn to ask you! What..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression changed abruptly, and she swiftly dodged Osborne's attack, her face showing anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, smiled lightly, "Sorry, I don't have the habit of answering questions from enemies, so you don't need to ask. Let's just fight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne launched another punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa fumed, "You ungentlemanly man. You don't keep your word! If so, just die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A burst of light erupted from Medusa No. 7's eyes, and Osborne's body instantly stiffened. Layers of stone began to form on his body, aiming to petrify him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The petrification process was incredibly eerie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned but wasn't overly panicked. The next moment, a faint crimson martial art aura materialized around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's useless! Martial artists are inherently half a level weaker than metahumans. Even your martial art aura can't block my petrification power! You will turn to stone and be shattered."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa No. 7's eyes were filled with sneer and disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the next second, her smile vanished, replaced by disbelief as she looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Osborne's crimson martial art aura appeared, Medusa No. 7's petrification power melted away as if ice met the sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stone skin on his body disappeared quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stretched his body and felt nothing wrong, then looked at Medusa No. 7 with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you just say? To turn me into stone and shatter me? That's too much trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll... just smash your head!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne launched another punch.</span></p><div class="pagination">
