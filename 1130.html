  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the cozy warmth of the room, Osborne held Clarissa close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you really ready for this, Clarissa?" he asked gently, his voice a soothing balm in the intimate space between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa felt her cheeks heat up and nodded, her heart racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, in this lifetime, I'm yours! I've waited so long for this day! I'm absolutely ready!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As her words sank in, a rush of heat coursed through Osborne's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had anticipated this moment for ages. If it weren't for the immense fate power within Clarissa, which they could only fully harness once they reached Class AAA, he would've been all in much earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the moment had finally come!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of them had ascended to Class S, and Clarissa's fate power was richer than ever, promising even greater benefits for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would wash over him, purify him, and elevate their connection to new heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But above all, Osborne didn't crave fate power; he simply wanted Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, I'm coming!" Osborne whispered, tenderly kissing her neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body tensed for a moment before relaxing into his touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determination flickered in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Osborne's member entered Clarissa's body, and in that instant, he felt an incredible force surge through him as the essence of her fate power flowed into his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is fate power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An endless tide of it poured into him, cleansing and renewing, without pain or discomfort&mdash;he barely noticed the transformation as he lost himself in the exquisite dance of love with Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time seemed to blur until Clarissa reached her peak once more, and that was when Osborne exploded in bliss, collapsing on top of her, utterly spent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He closed his eyes, surrendering to the wave of miraculous fate power still washing over him, bringing him back to a state of pure comfort and serenity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain and torment he once feared seemed to dissipate into nothingness, leaving only warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's hand lovingly traced his face, her gaze brimming with tenderness and affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a fleeting image of the God of Night danced in her mind&mdash;the figure that had captivated countless goddesses in her past life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, as quickly as it appeared, that vision shattered, replaced by Osborne's visage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My man is Osborne!" she murmured softly, slowly sitting up and gathering her clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flutter of uncertainty, Clarissa stood by the bed, watching him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Isa appeared beside her, looking at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa felt a rush of color flood her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne still lay bare, remnants of their passionate sex scattered across the sheets, an undeniable testament to their shared moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa shot Isa a glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you a peeping Tom or something? You promised not to interrupt us! Can't you just show up a little later?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled nonchalantly and said, "He's my man too, you know! You two are done, so why shouldn't I come and take a look? Besides, I didn't disturb anything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa rolled her eyes in exasperation. "Sure, the fate power is already given to him, but he's Class S now. My fate power won't really help him that much, will it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa shook her head firmly. "You're mistaken! The fate power is crucial for him&mdash;much more than you realize!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It plays a significant role in whether he can ignite the flame of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But that might be a long way off!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right now, we need to go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Isa's words, Clarissa's body stiffened, and a flicker of hesitation crossed her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you think you should at least say goodbye to him? We should wait until he wakes up before leaving."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa chuckled. "What? Can't bear to part with him? Saying goodbye when he wakes up will only make it harder for him! Besides, if you want to be with him forever, you need to understand how important and urgent what we have to do is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa bit her lip, torn between her emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I'm just worried about his safety. The world is about to change dramatically! Can he handle it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's voice turned resolute. "He has to handle it, whether he's ready or not!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is his trial! If he can't deal with this little trouble, then he's not our hope!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence hung heavy in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long pause, Clarissa finally nodded, her resolve hardening. "You're right!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go! We need to bring along the God of Death and the God of Life... I hope he doesn't chew us out!" Isa said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With one last serious glance at Osborne, Isa vanished into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa bit her lip, gave Osborne a lingering look filled with unspoken words, and disappeared as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne was in a peculiar state, caught in a deep slumber. The fate power surrounded him like a cocoon, while within, he underwent an intense transformation. Unbeknownst to him, the two women he loved had already left, and they were taking two more of his beloved women with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne slept on, lost in this dreamlike state for three long months.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, one day, he suddenly opened his eyes.</span></p><div class="pagination">
