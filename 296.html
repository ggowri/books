  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison stared at </span><span>Osborne,</span><span> her eyes wide with disbelief. "Mr. Augustine, did I hear you right? Is this some kind of joke?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled softly, the kind of smile that radiated warmth. "You heard me correctly, Alison. It's a gift for you. I told you I wouldn't let your hard work go unnoticed. Take it; you deserve it. After all, you're one of my most valuable team members now. We need to make some serious profit together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he gently pressed the box into her hands, leaving her utterly speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gazing down at the blue scepter, she felt a shiver run through her, her body trembling suddenly. Tears began to well up, and before she could stop herself, they cascaded down her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Setting the wooden box aside, Alison sprang into Osborne's arms, holding him tightly. "Mr. Augustine, I'm over the moon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not just about the beautiful jewelry. It's the kindness you've shown me! I once </span><span>said that if someone gifted me something like this, I'd do anything for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I, Alison, swear that I'm yours from now on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll work my fingers to the bone to earn money for you, Mr. Augustine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you have other requests, I'm all in!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison lifted her head from his shoulder, her eyes glazed with tears yet shining with a mix of shyness and hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood frozen, his arms awkwardly suspended in mid-air, unsure of where to place them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh, could you, maybe, let go of me first before we continue this chat?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not letting go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison shook her head vigorously, her cheeks flushed. Instead of pulling away, she stood on her tiptoes and pressed a light kiss on his cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she added, "Mr. Augustine, you're the best! You've given me such a precious gift, and I just don't know how to repay you. Maybe I could..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face turned even redder as if she were weighing a big decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Alison could finish, Osborne hurriedly covered her mouth with his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, stop right there! Alison, I simply wanted to reward an employee. Let's not make this awkward and give anyone the wrong idea!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just focus on managing Luna Jewelry and the diamond mine. Making money for me is your way of repaying this kindness. Now, I have to go, so you should get some rest!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne hastily packed the three wooden boxes into his Dimensional Space and practically bolted out of the shop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison watched him flee, stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "I've practically thrown myself at him, offering to be his anything, and there he goes running away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bad Mr. Augustine!" Alison whispered, pouting briefly before bursting into a giggle, her face softening with tenderness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gently, she picked up the blue scepter, marveling at its beauty as though it were the most exquisite treasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne made his somewhat chaotic exit from Luna Jewelry, finding his way back to the Institute of Human Research, where Isa was coaching Zoe through her training regimen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's face lit up when she spotted Osborne, her voice ringing through the room like a bell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Focus on your training! Don't get distracted!" Isa chimed in, scolding her lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe immediately stuck her tongue out in response, clearly feeling the reprimand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa turned her attention to Osborne, her eyes narrowing playfully. "You might want to wipe that lipstick stain off your cheek."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt his face heat up as he suddenly remembered that Alison had left her mark on him during that unexpected embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Goodness, that girl was bold!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa teased, a mischievous grin spreading across her face, "What's this? Your little girlfriend has been whisked away, and yet here you are, back just three days later with a lipstick kiss? Living the good life, aren't you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Already moved on from your girlfriend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a weary sigh, saying, "It was just a little mix-up! I was handing out some benefits to the employees, and one of them got a bit overzealous and kissed me on the cheek. I swear, I didn't do anything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa said, "Yeah, yeah, no need to explain yourself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What you do is your own business, not like you're my concern or anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you here to say goodbye? Listen, I have to warn you. Dampston isn't exactly Skyefall. When it comes to geography and economic development, Dampston is miles ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not to mention, the power and influence of Dampston's factions are way stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got to be extra careful while you're there. Remember, you still owe me a promise, so don't go off and get yourself killed too easily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, hearing Isa's underlying concern, felt a warmth spreading through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled, "Thanks for worrying about me, but this isn't a farewell visit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa raised an eyebrow, her surprise palpable. "Not saying goodbye?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's up? Have you given up? Don't you want to head to Dampston and get your little girlfriend back? That's not the Osborne I know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He replied calmly, "Of course, I'm not backing down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I also don't want to say goodbye to you. I'm actually here because I want to invite you. I could really use your help on this trip to Dampston."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? You want me to go with you?" Isa's expression shifted to one of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She frowned slightly and retorted, "Why on earth would I go to Dampston to help you? Who do you think I am, your sidekick or something? It's dangerous there, and I'm doing just fine here. You shouldn't even..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish her sentence, her words hung in the air as Osborne suddenly opened his Dimensional Space, pulling out two items. One of them was a stunning sword sheath adorned with flawless diamonds, catching the light with a glimmer that could make anyone's heart race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other was...</span></p><div class="pagination">
