  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They saw Osborne blocking them and were instantly overjoyed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Knew you'd be fine!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Where did you come from? Have you been hiding nearby all along?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've been around here all along. I was the first to arrive!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were instantly surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then why didn't you go in? Not long ago, a sudden flash of light appeared before us. At first, we thought it was dangerous, but later we realized those were emperor fruits!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Those are emperor fruits!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara excitedly continued, "The most important thing is that after obtaining that emperor fruit, we felt a massive spiritual energy in this direction. Just sensing it made us feel like our cultivation level was about to break through! So we rushed over immediately!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Unfortunately, we were quite far from here and only just arrived now! I&rsquo;m afraid others have already gone in, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, let's hurry in too. Otherwise, all the good stuff inside will be taken by others!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara was a bit anxious at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy and Casey's expressions were also very anxious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But their words made Osborne's expression even more serious. He thought to himself, "Each of them got an emperor fruit?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Did the emperor fruit also fly to them on its own? After obtaining the emperor fruit, they felt the jungle's spiritual energy!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt even more that there was something wrong with this jungle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Don't go in! There's danger in this jungle!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They exchanged a glance, a bit puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if there's danger, so what? There's always danger in the Skyfall Casket! The three of us were lucky to be teleported to the edge of this Ancient Battlefield. If we were less lucky, we'd probably already be dead!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This jungle can't be more dangerous than the Ancient Battlefield, right? Besides, everyone else has gone in. If we don't, and it turns out there's no danger, we'll lose out big time. There must be plenty of emperor fruits inside, and even if we're the last to arrive, as long as we go in, we'll still gain something."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were a bit hesitant at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said firmly, "No matter what, I think we shouldn't go into this jungle! As for those emperor fruits, if you just want emperor fruit, I have some!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne took out some emperor fruits and gave each of them twenty.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were instantly stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"These twenty emperor fruits are enough to raise your cultivation level to Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, or even Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness! Now listen to me. We can't enter the jungle! At least not now. Let's observe the situation first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They looked at the emperor fruits in their hands and exchanged a quick glance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, we'll listen to you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They wanted to enter the jungle just to find some emperor fruits, but even if they went in, they might not get twenty.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now that Osborne had given each of them twenty, their desire to enter the jungle wasn't as strong anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne breathed a sigh of relief and led them to the distant ruins.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The four of them looked at the distant jungle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, do you really think there's something wrong with this jungle? Could it be that you're mistaken? The first people who entered have been inside for almost an hour, right? This jungle isn't that big, maybe they're about to finish scouring it and come out soon," Clara asked softly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm not sure either. I feel like once you enter this jungle, you might never leave easily."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne finished speaking and continued observing the jungle with Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The jungle was incredibly quiet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And that's what felt off to him. At least a hundred people had entered the jungle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "This jungle isn't that big. They're searching for emperor fruit or other treasures inside. How could they not clash over treasures?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And as long as there was a fight in the jungle, there would inevitably be battle fluctuations, which Osborne would sense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the jungle was incredibly quiet, without a single unusual fluctuation!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt increasingly uneasy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had a vague feeling that something big was about to happen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go, let's move further back!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne led Clara and the others to retreat further, hiding in a more distant place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, he suddenly noticed that the incredibly quiet jungle began to change, as if it had come alive. Those peculiar plants started twisting suddenly. The outermost branches intertwined with each other, forming a massive web that seemed to enclose the entire jungle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Something's definitely wrong!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's heart pounded wildly. Dozens of figures suddenly rushed out from the depths of the jungle&mdash;it was the same people who had entered earlier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Weston, Quinn, Naomi, and even May and the others were all there.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, their eyes no longer held excitement, thrill, or greed&mdash;only fear and panic. They wanted to leave the jungle but were blocked by the web formed by the branches.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They attacked the web with all their might, but it was completely useless. Nearly forty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors couldn't even break through that web!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, Osborne still couldn't sense any energy fluctuations at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those people were all panicking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They wanted to rush out of the jungle but couldn't. At that moment, the branches behind them swiftly came toward them and wrapped around their bodies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The branches, like sharp blades, easily pierced through their defenses and stabbed into their bodies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, their bodies froze and could no longer move.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Weston, Quinn, Naomi, May, Mason, Brenda, and over thirty other Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors were pierced by the branches, suspended in mid-air, and eventually dragged back into the depths of the jungle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The scene was utterly terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, Clara, Leroy, and Casey were all dumbfounded at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What... what was that?" Clara asked, her voice trembling slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath, "They're done for! That jungle is indeed dangerous! Those emperor fruits that flew out earlier were just bait to lure you into the jungle!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone who entered the jungle is doomed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They looked at Osborne gratefully.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne hadn't stopped them, they would have entered the jungle long ago.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And their fate would be no different from those pierced by branches and dragged into the depths of the jungle!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Osborne who saved them once again!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But they didn't know that Osborne was also filled with fear at this moment. Initially, he too wanted to venture deep into the jungle, but it was Primordial who persuaded him otherwise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, he might have been the first to get trapped inside!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go! That forest is not something we can mess with, and we can't save anyone!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We need to get out of here first!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
