  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's body was sent flying, crashing heavily to the ground and carving out a trench several dozen feet long before finally coming to a stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Osborne in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the spatial fluctuation occurred, he felt a sense of danger, but Osborne's arrival had been too fast for him to evade. He barely managed to set up a lightning defense on his chest before being thrown aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Osborne's punch did not contain all of his strength, it was still immensely terrifying, breaking several of Alexander's ribs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Struggling to stand up, Alexander glared at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne! You actually dared to show up. How dare you ambush and hurt me? You are dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless experts from the Paltrow family surrounded Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne showed no fear. He coldly stared at Alexander and said, "The one who is supposed to die is you. But you don't need to rush. I guarantee that today, one of us will die here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Osborne ignored Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to look at Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa also gazed back at him, her eyes filled with tears as they rolled down her beautiful cheeks, mixing with the blood on her face, making Osborne feel a pain that was hard to breathe through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, Clarissa. I arrived late."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa shook her head vigorously, forcing a smile. "No, Osborne, you didn't. I knew you would come. You promised to share my burdens, and I believed you would definitely come."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Clarissa dashed into Osborne's arms, holding him tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne embraced her just as firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he smelt her fragrance mixed with blood, his resolve solidified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He patted Clarissa's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, heal your injuries. I will handle everything else. Today, I will definitely take you away. Whoever dares to stop me will die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa trembled and nodded firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She waved her hand to use divine healing, rapidly restoring her injuries. Her pale face regained its color, and in an instant, she was completely healed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Fate Staff reappeared in her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She moved closer to Osborne, grasping his hand with her other hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I want to fight alongside you. We will share the burden together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt some concern for Clarissa but nodded nonetheless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, we will share the burden. However, you have already fought, and now it's my turn. I am destined to battle Alexander. You stay back and watch. If I can't win, then you can step in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa hesitated briefly before nodding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. Osborne, be careful. Alexander is powerful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled calmly, "Is that so? I think not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Osborne walked step by step toward Alexander, roaring, "Alexander, come out and fight. I told you, today, one of us will die here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And that person can only be you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was filled with rage, especially when he saw Osborne tightly embracing Clarissa. He nearly went insane with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved for all the Paltrow family members to step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have been hidden for over ten days, and I thought you were afraid of me. Now it seems you've been hiding away to break through your realm, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow. "If you think so, then fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've broken through to Class A, but do you think you're my opponent? You're too naive. You have no idea how vast the gap between us is.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you want to seek death, then I'll grant you that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will turn you into a charred remains in front of Clarissa. Once you're dead, the woman you love will lie in my bed, at my mercy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Alexander raised his hands again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heavy dark clouds above thickened instantly, surging like a tide, continuously flashing with purple light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thunder at my will. Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Endless lightning rained down from the sky toward Osborne, even stronger than the attacks directed at Clarissa beforehand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alexander appeared like a deity commanding thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under his control, the terrifying lightning reached Osborne's head in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a slight sting on his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at the apocalyptic scene without showing any signs of fear, even revealing a disdainful smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, is this all you have?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are disappointing me. Do you think you can harm me with such lightning attacks?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're kidding."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, a blood-red martial art aura suddenly erupted around Osborne, intertwined with a faint blue light known as Devil's Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The martial art aura and Devil's Light fused rapidly, giving rise to a surge of pale yellow energy.</span></p><div class="pagination">
