  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, you're here to bet too?" Leroy asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy and Clara followed Osborne into the Phantom Commerce Guild's casino, watching him curiously, guessing how he would place his bet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded slightly without much explanation and began surveying the scene inside the casino.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The noise here even surpassed that of the auction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The noisy chatter rose and fell, with everyone enthusiastically discussing the possible outcomes of the zone duel for each contestant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne glanced around and noticed that the Phantom Commerce Guild's casino had set up unusually simple bets for the zone duel, with only two options: champion bet and top ten bet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He first found his name on the top ten betting list, with odds of 1 to 2.5.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The odds weren&rsquo;t high, but they weren&rsquo;t low either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the entire list, fewer than twenty people had lower odds than him. This meant that, in the eyes of the Phantom Commerce Guild, fewer than twenty people had a better chance than him to make the top ten.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne considered this assessment fairly objective.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, his performance in the state duel was impressive enough. He successfully found a large number of tokens, something the Phantom Commerce Guild was surely aware of.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the zone duel was essentially a Treasure Hunt.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the eyes of the Phantom Commerce Guild, Osborne had a certain advantage in this aspect, so his odds of making the top ten were ranked within the top twenty.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, this also left Osborne feeling a bit disappointed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Due to the low odds, even if he bet his entire fortune, he wouldn't earn much Sacred Crystal in the end.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, Osborne noticed names like Valentino from the Rose Rebels and Brenda from the </span><span>Skyearth</span><span> Dominion on the top ten betting list.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their odds were much lower than Osborne's, especially Valentino's, which was only 1.1 to 1.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This indicates that the Phantom Commerce Guild was almost certain that as long as nothing unexpected happened, Valentino would secure a top ten spot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, not only was Valentino incredibly strong, but the Rose Rebels had also acquired the Void Ray Starry Eye, which enhanced vision and precisely locked onto treasures, giving him a clear advantage in zone duels.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In contrast, although Brenda was considered stronger, her odds were slightly higher at 1.2 to 1.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, barring any surprises, she was also seen as a strong contender for a top ten spot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, this only pertains to the top ten bets.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly turned his attention to the championship odds list.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the top of the list was still Valentino, with championship odds of 2 to 1.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That's quite low odds, considering the Zone Duel gathers a thousand top players from a hundred states, where anything can happen, and some lucky underdog might even emerge as a dark horse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For those truly skilled, making the top ten might be relatively easy, but winning the championship requires more luck.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda's championship odds: 2.5 to 1</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dustin's championship odds: 3.5 to 1</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>McKinley's championship odds: 3.8 to 1</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordan's championship odds: 5.2 to 1</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These are the top five players with the lowest championship odds and the most talked-about favorites. They all come from First-rate Power, the talents they focus on nurturing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy and Clara also mentioned these names to Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne continued browsing the list.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Apart from these top five favorites, the championship odds for other players increased significantly, with the sixth place reaching 10 to 1.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This change caught Osborne's eye, and he eagerly continued checking to see what his championship odds were.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, after going through all thirty names on the list one by one, he still couldn't find his name and immediately frowned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My name isn't even in the championship betting options? Does this mean the people at Phantom Commerce Guild casino think I have no chance of winning, not even worth </span><span>being listed as a betting option?" Thinking of this, Osborne couldn't help but feel a bit displeased.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He originally thought that in this zone duel, he wouldn't be underestimated again, but the truth proved he was still overlooked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the one underestimating him was the Phantom Commerce Guild casino.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More importantly, since his name wasn't in the championship betting options, he couldn't bet on himself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought for a moment and directly approached the casino staff. "Excuse me, I want to place a championship bet, but the person I want to bet on isn't in the options. Could you help me add them?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Osborne finished speaking, the staff member was stunned. "The person you want to bet on isn't in the championship options? That only means the person you want to bet on has almost no chance of winning. So, I suggest you choose someone else to bet on. Or, you could try the top ten betting options; maybe you'll find the name of the person you want to bet on there."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The odds for the top ten bets were just too low. His odds were only 1 to 2.5, and even if he wagered his entire fortune, he could only earn less than 500,000 Sacred Crystal in the end.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He insisted, "I just want to place a championship bet. Can you help me add the person I want to bet on to the options? If you can't decide, you can contact your superior. I'm planning to bet at least hundreds of thousands of Sacred Crystal."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, a hint of excitement flashed in the staff member's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betting hundreds of thousands of Sacred Crystal on someone not in the options and almost impossible to win was basically giving money to the casino.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The staff cautiously asked, "Sir, are you sure? If you really want to do this, I can contact my superior!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne firmly nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the staff led Osborne into a room, and a mid-level manager from the casino walked in. He was a middle-aged man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He curiously glanced at Osborne and asked, "Sir, may I know who you want to bet on as the champion? To be honest, our casino has the most professional analysis team. The thirty people in the champion betting options all have a certain chance of winning. If someone isn't in this list, it's almost impossible for them to win."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled calmly. "Really? It's fine! I just want to support him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The person I want to bet on is named Osborne! Osborne from Zephyr State!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Osborne finished speaking, the middle-aged man nodded. "Osborne from Zephyr State does have decent strength, but he comes from the Mystic Sirius Sect of a Second-rate Power. He has a chance to make it into the top ten, but winning the championship is too difficult!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since you just want to support a friend, I won't stop you! I'll immediately add Osborne's name to the championship betting options."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As for the odds, let's make it a round number, 1 to 100!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The middle-aged man clearly didn't recognize Osborne. After all, Osborne's demeanor now is vastly different from during the state duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The middle-aged man casually operated a few times, and Osborne's name appeared in the championship betting options.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His odds were ranked last.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The 1 to 100 odds were the highest among all betting options.</span></p><div class="pagination">
