  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the Goddess of Grain's Scythe made contact with Mosley's wings, a horrifying, tearing sound filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then came a blood-curdling scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mosley shrieked in agony as her once sharp wings were now severed at the tips. Black, viscous blood poured out, splattering everywhere with each beat of her remaining wings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black blood seemed to have a dreadful corrosive quality. Wherever it landed, it created deep, gaping holes. Even Osborne's martial art aura couldn't withstand it; it was instantly corroded and splattered onto his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's flesh was being eaten away by the black blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gasped in pain, his face contorted with agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he swung the Goddess of Grain's Scythe, hacking away the corrupted flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he didn't act fast, he feared the black blood would bore holes right through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mosley was still howling with rage. With one of her wings cut off, her balance faltered, her eyes turning blood-red with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard! You'll pay for this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne noticed Mosley's injured mouth part starting to glow ominously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is bad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Satan's Eye vibrated wildly, sensing imminent danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Prison!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, Osborne cast Spatial Prison, trying to trap Mosley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the next heartbeat, Mosley burst out of the prison effortlessly. Her glowing, menacing mouth part pierced through the Spatial Prison like a spear, aiming straight for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed was blindingly fast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne barely had time to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only summon his martial art aura to form a shield in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the next moment, Mosley's mouth part pierced through the aura shield like it was made of paper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mandibles were like an unstoppable spear, rendering Osborne's defense utterly useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spear-like mouth part drove straight into his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Argh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a pained roar as his body was impaled. Despite the excruciating pain, he swung the Goddess of Grain's Scythe with all his might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clash of metal on metal echoed as the razor-sharp scythe met Mosley's mouth part.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, it encountered something that didn't cut through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scythe left only a shallow notch on the mouth part.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned. With his strength, even an Ordinary divine artifact would have been cleaved through, and a Premium divine artifact would have at least been cut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Mosley's mouth part?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as tough as Premium divine artifacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mosley was equally shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mosley roared in fury, "Damn it! What kind of scythe is this? It can not only sever my wings but also damage my mouth part?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dammit, I'll kill you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to drain your blood right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a horrifying suction force erupted from her mouth part. The immense pull, like a powerful pump, rapidly began draining the blood energy from Osborne's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Mosley's mouth part seemed to secrete a dreadful paralyzing toxin. Osborne felt his body gradually going numb and unresponsive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in horror as he tried to free himself from Mosley's mouth part, but found he was utterly powerless to do so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Mosley's eyes, there was nothing but contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Little worm, you're as good as dead! Soon, I'll drain all your blood and consume every bit of your potent blood energy! Once I've absorbed you, my strength will be greatly restored, and I'll deal with that fool outside and regain my freedom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After that, I'll wipe out every last pest on Blue Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mosley was giddy with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body trembled as he felt the massive loss of blood energy. He grew weaker, and his complexion turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I going to die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne bit his lip, battling the intense dizziness. "Is this really how it ends? Am I going to die like this? No, I refuse to accept it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a desperate bid, Osborne bit his tongue hard to jolt himself awake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Even if I have to die, I won't make it easy for you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm going down fighting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he felt the grip of death, Osborne's resolve hardened instantly. Ignoring everything else, he unleashed all his hidden cards and attacks in one explosive burst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dissolving Light!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Collapse!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thunder of Judgment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
