  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Paramount Supreme Clan gasped in disbelief as they witnessed Osborne holding up Aldrich's severed head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich had been defeated!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only had he lost, but he hadn't even had a chance to escape; Osborne had completely decimated him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a mid-stage Deity King, once decapitated, faced certain death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred, who had just awakened, was paralyzed by shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aldrich... he's a mid-stage Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he lose?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he possibly be defeated and have his head cut off by someone like Theodore, who's merely a Deity Overlord?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This... this is impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone around him was in utter disbelief&mdash;whether they were warriors from the Paramount Supreme Clan, the Demonic Dragon Clan, the Soaring Lion Clan, or even the Mystic Feather Clan, all were stunned into silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't unusual for a Deity Overlord to take down a Deity King, especially with the aid of powerful divine artifacts and equipment. Many prodigies from the Paramount Supreme Clan and other clans had done just that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred himself had previously leveraged the might of the Supreme Malevolence Sword and Shield to defeat ten Deity King warriors from the Mystic Feather Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to have a Deity Overlord defeat a mid-stage Deity King?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a thing had never been witnessed, nor had any Deity Overlord been bold enough to challenge a mid-stage Deity King before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Aldrich wasn't just any mid-stage Deity King; he was a proud warrior of the Paramount Supreme Clan, equipped with his own Supreme Malevolence Sword and Shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In such circumstances, no one had considered the possibility of Aldrich's defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there they were, faced with the shocking reality. Aldrich had not only lost but he had been killed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, all eyes shifted to Osborne. They understood that a prodigy had risen to power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The name Theodore echoed in their minds, and soon, the news of this battle would spread throughout Celestara, with Theodore's name known far and wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings would rise to fame as a result of this extraordinary clash!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Anastasia, Kendra, and others released long-held breaths of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew Osborne could do it!" Anastasia murmured, a smile lighting up her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne tossed Aldrich's head to the ground, where it landed heavily at Alfred's feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred looked down at Aldrich's lifeless gaze, a storm of emotions churning inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell happened?" Alfred whispered, then shouted in rage, "We need to avenge Uncle Aldrich! That bastard killed him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you? You murdered a warrior of the Bowman family. You must pay! Who do you think you are, calling yourself the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings? We'll make sure you die for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Aldrich dead, Alfred naturally assumed command, his furious shout igniting anger among the nearby Paramount Supreme Clan warriors and the Bowman family's guards, who glared at Osborne with deadly intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warriors from the Demonic Dragon Clan and Soaring Lion Clan were equally enraged, ready to spring into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne regarded them with a cool smile, unaffected by their bluster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? Anger over a loss? You think you can take me down to avenge him? Sorry, but you're still outmatched!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne scanned his surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bowman family, Demonic Dragon Clan, and Soaring Lion Clan had brought out an impressive arsenal against the Mystic Feather Clan, including four Supreme Malevolence Airships, twenty Deity King warriors, five hundred peak Deity Overlords, and over two thousand Deity Overlord-level warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with Aldrich, their strongest fighter, fallen at Osborne's hands, they were still a formidable force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wouldn't be easy for Osborne and Anastasia to contend with them alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this was the moment for the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings to make their mark, and the stronger their enemies, the better the victory would taste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They weren't alone in this fight; they had the Mystic Feather Clan warriors backing them up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eleven Deity Kings stood ready, and aside from Maxime, who was severely injured, the others still had the strength to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough talk&mdash;let's battle! Kill!" shouted Osborne, leading the charge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, chaos erupted once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four Supreme Malevolence Airships unleashed a torrent of firepower while nineteen Deity King warriors from the Paramount Supreme Clan, Demonic Dragon Clan, and Soaring Lion Clan lunged forward with lethal intent, aiming straight for Osborne, Anastasia, and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No more holding back; everyone unleashed their full force, desperate to eliminate their foes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay sharp!" Osborne called out to Anastasia, Zoe, and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He passed two Supreme Malevolence Swords and a Supreme Malevolence Shield to the relatively weaker Hannah and Bryce. Without another word, he surged ahead toward the oncoming Deity King warriors from the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Eclipse of Eternity reared its head once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eight Spatial Clones materialized beside him, along with a thousand Dark Undeads, ready to join the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given Osborne's current power, taking down a mid-stage Deity King like Aldrich was no easy feat, but he found it remarkably easy to deal with ordinary Deity King warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paired with his Spatial Clones, he rapidly dispatched one Paramount Supreme Clan Deity King after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, on the other side of the battlefield, Anastasia, Zoe, Bryce, Kendra, and Mila worked together seamlessly. Their combined strength allowed them to effortlessly overpower their own Deity King opponents.</span></p><div class="pagination">
