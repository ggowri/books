  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne scrutinized the map, feeling an exasperated sigh bubble to the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The location of the Celestial Crystal mining area was a staggering 60 thousand miles deep into Divine Peak Nine. So far, only one person had ventured this far, and while he had returned with news of the Celestial Crystal, his injuries were so severe that he succumbed shortly afterward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Surrounding the mining area was a vast expanse of uncharted territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The last exploration team, led by a Deity King warrior, had encountered a national-level Deathborn nest just over three thousand miles from the mining site. They suffered devastating casualties, barely making it back alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Deity King warrior had left behind a path, but it was fraught with danger, riddled with village-level, town-level, and even some city-level Deathborn nests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If the Deity King and his team had managed to traverse that treacherous road, it didn't mean they would have the same luck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, with their exploration team, the chances of following the path of a Deity King warrior and reaching the Celestial Crystal mines were slim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But they had no other choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The unexplored areas were far more dangerous. With their current strength, they might be able to handle village-level or town-level Deathborn nests, but if they stumbled upon a city-level Deathborn nest, it would be a guaranteed death sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned, lost in thought. "I wonder what Algernon plans for our route.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the team leader, he's supposed to direct us on whether to follow the Deity King warrior's trail or blaze a new path."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glanced ahead at Algernon, who was leading the charge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They weren't far from Divine Peak Nine now; those with sharper vision could already see its shadow looming through the dense fog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their luck seemed to hold as they had not encountered any Deathborn attacks along the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's take a breather," Algernon announced, prompting the group to halt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A few members took turns keeping watch while Algernon huddled with four other early-stage Deity Overlords, spreading the map out for discussion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Algernon broke the silence. "We're about to set foot on Divine Peak Nine! Before we start scaling it, we need to decide how to approach the Celestial Crystal mining area."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of the team members chimed in, "What's there to debate?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We should definitely stick to the route left by the Deity King warrior! We have a solid path laid out; why wander into completely unknown territory? We can't possibly explore our way six thousand miles into the depths!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Absolutely, I'm all for following the Deity King warrior's path! Sure, there are plenty of dangers along the way, like at least two city-level Deathborn nests and five town-level nests. But it's manageable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We can navigate around those dangerous areas when we get close, reducing our time spent in uncharted territory by a huge margin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Right, I agree!" another added, nodding fervently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The four early-stage Deity Overlords all sided with the idea of sticking to the Deity King warrior's established route, planning to reroute only when confronted with town-level or city-level Deathborn nests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This, they all felt, was the safest approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Algernon nodded in agreement. "This really is the safest way forward! If we stick to this route, we'll only need to navigate around five town-level Deathborn nests, two city-level nests, and finally, the national-level nest to reach the Celestial Crystal mining area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's a total of eight detours! If luck is on our side during these eight reroutes, we should be able to make it there safely. It's definitely a much safer option than trying to forge a completely new path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since everyone's on board, let's go with this plan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He relayed the decision to the rest of the group, and there were no objections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Osborne remained silent, contemplating the plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Eight detours&mdash;if we play our cards right, we might just reach the Celestial Crystal mining area in one piece. I bet Algernon and the others had this mapped out well before they accepted the task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But will it really go that smoothly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't shake the feeling of dread. Divine Peak Nine was shrouded in mystery and danger. Over the years, countless teams had attempted to explore its depths, managing to chart only about one-tenth of the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The cost had been staggering&mdash;thousands of warriors had lost their lives in the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The average death rate for expeditions into Divine Peak Nine was nearly ninety percent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Out of every ten people, only one would return alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Total annihilation was a common outcome. They were about to plunge 60 thousand feet into perilous territory, making eight detours into completely unknown regions. Could they really reach the Celestial Crystal mining area safely?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt the odds were slim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Perhaps the exploration team led by Deity King Angelo has a shot at success. But I won't let them get their hands on the Celestial Crystal just to curry favor with the Bowman family! I have to sabotage their plans!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With newfound determination flashing in his eyes, he declared, "Let's start the ascent!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
