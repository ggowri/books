  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's curiosity was piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that Divine Shadow was able to control her Divine Flame, igniting a spark of intrigue within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne could hide her Divine Flame, then perhaps he could mask his true power as well&mdash;keeping his deity level under wraps could yield unexpected advantages in countless situations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow's expression turned serious; her brows knitted together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This technique is a special secret."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's breath caught in his throat, a hint of disappointment creeping in as he replied, "If it's too much trouble to teach me, then I won't press. I was just curious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to leave, but Divine Shadow called after him, "Wait a second, Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This technique isn't as precious as you think; it's just a bit unique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Given my relationship with your grandfather, teaching you isn't a big deal. Besides, you're Mila's savior. But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's spirits lifted. "Really? That's great, Grandma Divine Shadow! But what's the catch?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a gentle smile, Divine Shadow continued, "Well, I only have a fragmented version of the technique. The complete secret is known only to Mila and her parents. If you truly want to learn it, you should ask Mila. If she's willing, she can teach you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he heard that, Osborne's gaze turned to Mila, who was looking baffled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Me? I'm not sure I even know how!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart sank. "Uh-oh, Grandma Divine Shadow, it seems like Mila might have lost quite a bit of her memory."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow chuckled. "That's alright! I've been through this before. The memories she's lost will come back to her soon enough. As for the technique, I'm confident she remembers it, although she might not recall what it's called."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning her attention to Mila, she said gently, "Mila, the complete technique is called the Eclipsing Mantra!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila's expression shifted from confusion to realization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh! It's the Eclipsing Mantra! I remember now! Osborne, do you want to learn? I can teach you right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another moment's hesitation, Osborne felt a flood of information swirl in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eclipsing Mantra!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gasped, astonished, as he looked at Mila. "Has she just transmitted the entire Eclipsing Mantra directly into my brain?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This means a completely seamless learning experience&mdash;no long-winded lessons or complex explanations required; I now have the complete technique at my fingertips."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila suddenly exclaimed, her eyes wide, "Wait a sec!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think I just gave you the entire Eclipsing Mantra! Didn't Mom and Dad say it only has five levels? I'm supposed to transfer only two or three levels to someone else!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne blinked in surprise. "Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow looked floored as well, scratching her nose. "I only managed to learn three levels myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a little sheepish, Osborne chuckled awkwardly. "Maybe I should just erase the memory of the Eclipsing Mantra from my brain?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mila, could you teach me the first two levels instead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila frowned in contemplation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she grinned and said, "Nah! I don't even remember who Mom and Dad are, so who cares what they said? Besides, I think the Eclipsing Mantra is pretty tricky. Even they only made it to the fourth level, and I haven't even mastered the third!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what if I transferred the fourth and fifth levels to you? You might not even be able to handle it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So be it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Mila bounced around playfully, her bright energy infectious, and it seemed she had already forgotten all about the potential complications.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow let out a resigned sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaning closer to Osborne, she murmured, "Remember, the Eclipsing Mantra is a legacy of Mila's parents, a technique so powerful and precious that even in the Age of Gods, it was coveted by many, including Deity King warriors. Never share it with anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If someone else were to come across the complete Eclipsing Mantra by accident, I would have no choice but to eliminate them to ensure it wouldn't leak out... but because it's you, I trust you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a warm pat on his shoulder, she added, "You're like family to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, feeling a bit overwhelmed, nodded in agreement. "Alright, I understand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued, "Now go. Mila and I reside at Mount Celestial Reach. On the outside, it seems ordinary, but within lies a mysterious Dimensional Space where we live."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Divine Shadow turned to leave, Osborne hesitated for a moment before asking a question that had long piqued his curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandma Divine Shadow, did Grandpa know that you can transform into a young woman... around twenty?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body stiffened at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face flushed a deep red as she shot Osborne a fierce glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen here, kid. You keep this between us! Not a word to anyone, especially your grandpa! Or you'll see what happens when I get mad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she grabbed Mila's hand and vanished into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All that remained was Mila's pure, innocent voice echoing in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, come visit me often!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rubbed his chin thoughtfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like Grandpa wasn't aware of Divine Shadow's ability to transform into a woman..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled, deciding not to dwell further on it. It was, after all, a personal matter between his grandfather and Divine Shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon enough, he returned to the Augustine Bastion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calculating the time, Osborne knew the Deschanel family would soon make their move against the League of Divine Descent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without hesitation, Osborne commanded, "Lock all satellites onto the key Divine Families within the League of Divine Descent."</span></p><div class="pagination">
