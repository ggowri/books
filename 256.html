  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's wedding was about to begin, but Osborne was still waiting at Luna Jewelry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In order to make the diamond fit perfectly in the crown, Alison needed to make some minor modifications to the main frame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a delicate job. To achieve the most perfect effect, Alison had to polish and adjust every step manually, and no mistakes were allowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could only wait patiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne's cell phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's gentle voice sounded. "Osborne, where are you now? We are ready to go to the wedding site."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm preparing a gift for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa became curious. "Osborne, you don't need to do that. I am already satisfied to be with you! I can't wait to rush to the wedding site and announce our relationship."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words deeply moved Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said softly, "Clarissa, I can't wait any longer as well. But since we are going to announce our relationship, how can I not prepare anything?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want others to think that I am not worthy of you and that I am just a gigolo."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa said, "I don't care what others think. I know you are worthy of me! But since you insist on preparing a gift, I'm looking forward to it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, my gift will definitely satisfy you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After chatting with Clarissa for a while longer, Osborne suddenly heard Donna's urging voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly reminded Clarissa to be careful. Then, he hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time continued to pass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, half an hour later, Alison came out, carefully holding an exquisite box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled excitedly at Osborne, "Mr. Augustine, it was fully inlaid! The effect is even more perfect than I expected! I swear, any woman who sees it will be fascinated by it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was also excited. He immediately took the box and opened it carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, bright red, blue, and green light reflected on Osborne's dull face and did not dissipate for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long time, Osborne took a deep breath and closed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm very satisfied! What is its name?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison hesitated for a moment. "Mr. Augustine, you should be the one name it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought for a while and suddenly remembered that Clarissa's identity was </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, "Let's call it Fate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fate? Crown of Fate?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison murmured, thinking that the name was a bit strange. But she didn't think much about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne held the box carefully, looking at Alison and saying, "I have to rush over immediately. I will reward you once I come back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you are satisfied, Mr. Augustine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember what you said. You said you would give me a diamond like this one. I </span><span>didn't dare to ask for one that big. I would be satisfied if it was half the size of this one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison winked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne waved his hand, walking out of the Luna Jewelry and opening the Dimensional Space casually. He temporarily hid the Crown of Fate. He would give it to Clarissa at the right time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Osborne drove quickly to Rose Castle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the Rose Castle was already extremely lively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the gang leaders, wealthy family heads, heirs, wealthy businessmen, celebrities, and numerous news media in </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> gathered in the Rose Castle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia and Wesley were still welcoming guests at the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a convoy drove slowly over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the badges on the cars, Wesley and Ophelia couldn't help but be shocked. Even their elders were surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is the Radcliffe family's convoy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Radcliffe family, the ancient family, actually sent a convoy here. Is there a big shot coming? Who would it be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley and Ophelia looked at each other, both somewhat confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ashford family and the Caldwell family were both wealthy families, but the gap between them and the ancient families was enormous. For their weddings, it was already a great honor for the ancient families to send someone to attend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was what the other five ancient families did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It already made Wesley and Ophelia feel proud. But now, the Radcliffe family actually sent a convoy of such a scale, and it was apparent that a big shot was present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They did not dare to hesitate and rushed to meet him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the convoy stopped. The bodyguards got out of the cars one by one and guarded the luxury car in the middle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Donna got out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley and Ophelia couldn't help but widen their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two were about to welcome Donna. But they saw her slightly move aside and open the car door herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a graceful woman got out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was wearing a gorgeous dress. Just as she appeared, the surroundings became quiet. Everyone looked at her in amazement, attracted by her perfect face and temperament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In comparison, the bride, Ophelia, was instantly overshadowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa smiled and said calmly, "I'm here to attend your wedding. I won't be unwelcome, right?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
