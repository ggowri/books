  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That damn tree! He actually talked Osborne into swiping nine drops of my Phoenix Blood! Next time I get my hands on him, I'm gonna teach him a lesson he won't soon forget." Agatha spat, the venom dripping from her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her expression softened, becoming a tangled web of emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne had heard her, his jaw would have hit the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither he nor Primordial had a clue that Agatha, encased in her icy prison, had been conscious the whole time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd heard every word, seen every action, helpless as a babe because she couldn't move a muscle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that powerlessness turned out to be a blessing in disguise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like Primordial had said, she did have a sliver of Dark Phoenix blood in her, and thanks to Osborne taking her Phoenix Blood and igniting the Flames of the Dark Phoenix, that dormant bloodline had roared to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From that moment on, she was a Dark Phoenix!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Possibly the only living Dark Phoenix on the entire Racial Convergence Planet, maybe even the entire cosmos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha glanced down at her arm, a dark energy thrumming beneath her skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dark flames flickered to life in her palm, swirling together into a single, mesmerizing blossom of fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flame was a breathtaking blend of red and black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Can't fully ignite the Flames of the Dark Phoenix yet! Gotta hit Empyrean Sacredness first, at least! But still, talk about a lucky break!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I seriously underestimated the Frost-kissed Heart. Thought I could handle the Arctic Maw Chasm's seventh layer's icy power with my Phoenix Skeletal Shield and Phoenix Flame, and just absorb the damn thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Almost got myself killed for good!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Thanks to Osborne...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha bit her lip, lost in thoughts. Not only had Osborne saved her from a frozen grave, but he'd inadvertently revived her Dark Phoenix bloodline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She owed him. Big time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could have left her for dead and looted her Phoenix Cry Bone Flute and Phoenix Skeletal Shield, but he chose to save her instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was more, he hadn't even stuck around to see her wake up. Agatha had to admit, she wouldn't have done the same in his place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she hadn't regained consciousness, she might never have known he had saved her at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Osborne, you've fused with my Phoenix Blood, so you're practically one of my Ember Phoenix Clan now! Plus, you ignited the Dark Phoenix Flame! In a way, you're half Dark Phoenix yourself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">In this cosmos, you and I are practically the only two Dark Phoenixes, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smile flickered across Agatha's face as she seemed to reach a decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's hesitation, Agatha didn't head toward Osborne on the other side of the snow mountain. Instead, she turned and left, retracing her steps out of the Arctic Maw Chasm's seventh layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, we'll meet again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that parting vow, Agatha vanished from the icy chasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, completely unaware, Osborne was still on the far side of the snow mountain, using Satan's Eye to locate Frost-kissed Hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's number eighty!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eighty-one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time ticked by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the fifth day of the state duel, Agatha reappeared in the Arctic Maw Chasm's sixth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at the status on her chest badge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Huh? My score's already plummeted out of the top ten? Horace is in the first place? Almost three million points already?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha quickly scanned the leaderboard, but didn't seem too concerned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With over two days still left in the state duel, there was plenty of time to snatch points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was confident she could claw her way back into the top ten, maybe even overtake Horace and reclaim the top spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when Agatha spotted Osborne's name lingering in twenty-second place, she couldn't help but press her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This guy... might be my toughest rival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He's the only one besides me who can survive in the seventh layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm. And he can nullify the Frost-kissed Heart's power in me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Now he's even ignited the Flames of the Dark Phoenix. Could he outshine me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought weighed heavily on Agatha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No way! I won't lose to him. He aims for the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel? So will I! And I'll top this state duel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Don't wanna get looked down by him later!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determination set on her face.</span><br><span>He's still in the seventh layer for Frost-kissed Hearts. I'll grab as many points as I can and leave him far behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Agatha sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Frost Peak City, the audience watched in awe as the once-vanished Agatha reappeared and went on a point-grabbing spree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha, the top-ranked competitor on the strength leaderboard, with a paltry million-point score outside the top ten, a far cry from her might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone expected her to win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now she was back. </span><span>The </span><span>power</span><span> she unleashed</span><span> left the audience gasping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most tuned in to watch her crush opponents and steal points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could evade or withstand her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even teams were easily vanquished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this fierce competition, Agatha was like an indefatigable and formidable point-harvesting machine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her points were skyrocketing at a terrifying, almost frenzied pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each point increase hit other competitors like a sledgehammer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The numbers on the scoreboard were changing in a flash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a day, Agatha's score hit three million, propelling her back into the top five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Horace, Broderick, and Benson were ahead of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the heat, the trio also went on a point-grabbing frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, they silently agreed to steer clear of each other until the final day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This spelled trouble for the rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether in the top ten, top twenty, or part of a strong team, they could only hope not to cross paths with the Big Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, escape would be a tall order!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Conrad bumped into Agatha, his face as white as a sheet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He warned, "Agatha, don't overstep!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fifteenth on the strength leaderboard, and my four teammates are all in the top hundred. Mess with me, and the result's up in the air!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha eyed him calmly. "Is that so? Then give it a shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got two million points, and I've over three million. If you win, take a tenth of mine. If I win, I'll take a tenth of yours. Sounds fair, doesn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conrad's face darkened even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Agatha's determination, he gritted his teeth and said, "Attack! So what if she's number one on the strength chart? Together, we can beat her! Charge!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
