  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne snorted, stared at Evelyn intently, and asked, &ldquo;Does this place belong to the Caldwell family? Why can&rsquo;t I be here? And why do you care where I go? Looks like you&rsquo;re itching for another spanking, huh?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As soon as she heard that, her eyes went wide, and a faint blush of embarrassment and fury swiftly spread across her lovely face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evelyn seemed to recall the scene from yesterday when Osborne angrily pinned her down on the sofa and relentlessly spanked her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo; she spat out through gritted teeth but didn&rsquo;t dare to say anything, fearing it would raise suspicion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just then, Justin retorted, &ldquo;How dare you talk to her like that, you worthless scum? Do you have a death wish?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne sneered, &ldquo;Justin, you should clean up your mess first. Don&rsquo;t think that speaking up for her will make Ophelia stop investigating you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You bastard!&rdquo; Justin erupted in anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne couldn&rsquo;t be bothered with him and strode toward the VIP lane.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that time, there was a long line at the entrance of the venue. Even the prestigious Caldwell family had to queue for inspection before entering. The VIP lane, however, remained empty and required no waiting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne had the Draco Star Wristlet, which allowed him access to any non-restricted area of the Draco Group without any hindrance. So, he naturally walked toward the VIP lane.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When the Caldwell family saw that, they immediately looked at him with disdain. To them, Osborne was just a commoner who couldn&rsquo;t even get an invitation, so they were baffled that he wanted to use the VIP lane.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">One of the Caldwells mocked, &ldquo;Are you stupid, Osborne? The Draco Auction isn&rsquo;t a place for losers like you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Do you even have an invitation, you worthless scum?&rdquo; another one chimed in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, another added, &ldquo;Even if you had an invitation, you still need to line up at the regular entrance like us. And you think you can use the VIP lane?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Immediately after, one of them shouted, &ldquo;A loser is always a loser. What a disgrace!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Caldwell family&rsquo;s taunts drew the attention of others. When they saw Osborne getting out of a taxi and attempting to use the VIP lane, they couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh. He instantly became the laughingstock of the crowd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He remained unfazed and soon reached the ticket-checking point of the VIP lane.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Upon seeing that, the crowd erupted again, with one of them incredulously asking, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s really not turning back?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Another shouted, &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll definitely be thrown out!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;ll break his legs!&rdquo; someone added.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, another mocked, &ldquo;Even a wealthy heir would be thrown out for defying the Draco Auction House&rsquo;s rules, let alone a loser like him.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">One laughed out loud and exclaimed, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s done for!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon after, Osborne walked to the VIP ticket checkpoint under the crowd&rsquo;s watchful eyes. Instead of presenting an invitation, he casually flicked his wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Following that, the security guards and a few lovely hostesses at the VIP lane, who had been expressionless, suddenly smiled warmly. They all nodded politely to Osborne and greeted him. &ldquo;Welcome, honored guest.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In an instant, the Caldwell family members were all dumbfounded. It was as if they&rsquo;d been dealt a heavy blow, leaving them in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Justin saw that Osborne was about to enter through the VIP lane, he shouted, &ldquo;Stop right there, Osborne!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Justin sternly said, &ldquo;Osborne, it&rsquo;s bad enough that you cheat and lie to the Caldwell family, but you actually have the nerve to cause trouble at the Draco Auction House? I&rsquo;m going to expose you today.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, he rushed to the VIP lane entrance and told the security guards, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Justin from the Caldwell family. I want to report him. He&rsquo;s pretending to be a VIP.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s actually just a commoner, an orphan with no background. Someone like him wouldn&rsquo;t even qualify for an invitation, let alone be one of your VIP guests.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s surely tricked you all. You should really investigate him. He&rsquo;s posing as a VIP, and he should be severely punished for it.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Once Justin finished speaking, he flashed them a flattering smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Afterward, he looked over at Osborne with a sneer as if to say, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re done for.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne chuckled and didn&rsquo;t rush inside. He crossed his arms and indifferently asked, &ldquo;Did you just say I&rsquo;m pretending to be a VIP, Justin? Are you suggesting that these people are blind and can&rsquo;t tell the real VIPs from the fake ones?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Upon hearing that, the security guards glared at Justin with menacing faces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Justin was startled and quickly explained, &ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not what I meant. I&rsquo;m just saying he&rsquo;s a professional scammer. Please don&rsquo;t be fooled by him.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. He&rsquo;s a scammer,&rdquo; Penelope rushed over and added. &ldquo;Gentlemen, we know him very well. He&rsquo;s absolutely not a VIP. He&rsquo;s garbage.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to scram, you worthless scum? If they find out you&rsquo;re faking it, you won&rsquo;t even know how you died.&rdquo; She looked at Osborne disdainfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He smiled at the security guards and said, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you take their advice and verify my identity? Maybe I really am a fake VIP.&rdquo;</p><div class="pagination">
