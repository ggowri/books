  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared coldly at Icy Six, Icy Seven, and Icy Eight as they approached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you're coming straight for us?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To kill us, not only have the Eight Dark Sovereigns mobilized, but you've also brought along a thousand Supernal Deity Kings. You really think highly of us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And just look at that&mdash;exactly a thousand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems there's indeed a traitor among the Human Community. Only a handful of people would know about a thousand Supernal Deity Kings protecting us..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured, casting a glance at Tanner and Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them was surely the traitor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both were currently locked in fierce combat with their respective Supernal Deity Kings, making it impossible to discern who among them was betraying the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps they were both involved?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Well, if I can't figure it out just yet, I'll wait for you to expose yourselves," he thought, shifting his focus back to Icy Six and his companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thousand Supernal Deity Kings meant to protect them were already entangled in battle, leaving Osborne and his group feeling isolated and vulnerable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had to face the three Dark Sovereigns on their own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Six was an Ascension Six Supernal Deity King, while Icy Seven and Icy Eight were both Ascension Five. To anyone watching, their combined strength seemed more than enough to wipe the floor with Osborne and his crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne had anticipated this very moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been waiting for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He summoned the energy of space around him, enveloping Anastasia and the others in a protective shroud. "Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, they vanished from their spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Six sneered, "Spatial power? What of it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This area is sealed by Ninefold Heaven's Tower!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Until the seal is broken, you can't escape, no matter how much spatial power you have!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It won't save you! After them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them quickly changed course, pursuing with terrifying speed. The sealed space extended out for a radius of 60 thousand miles, and Osborne's interdimensional travel soon hit the barrier, forcing him to halt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Icy Six and his companions reached the edge of the seal, closing in fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Osborne possessed spatial power and could travel interdimensionally, his speed hardly outpaced theirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne and his group materialized, Icy Six was already hot on their heels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression remained stoic as he continued to use interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three Dark Sovereigns exchanged glances, determined to keep up. While they could catch up to Osborne, holding him down proved to be a different story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while of fruitless pursuit, Icy Six let out a cold snort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial power is indeed a pain! Looks like I'll need to pull out some special tricks!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly retrieved a humanoid stone sculpture from his Dimensional Bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he infused it with divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stone sculpture erupted in a burst of light, and an invisible wave of energy spread outwards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne immediately felt the strain; using interdimensional travel became significantly harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he could still perform it, it required more energy and time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled, deciding to abandon the interdimensional travel and instead stand his ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Casting a glance toward the God of Light, he saw her locked in a fierce battle with Icy One and the others. The clash was so intense that no one else could intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The residual force alone could easily obliterate most Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the Supernal Deity Kings on both sides were engaged in fierce combat, with no clear advantage emerging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough of the theatrics; it's time to get down to business!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained still, waiting for Icy Six and the others to catch up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the three Dark Sovereigns appeared, swiftly surrounding him from three different directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After completing their encirclement, Icy Six laughed coldly. "Why aren't you running anymore? Realizing you can't escape, are you ready to surrender and beg for mercy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Escape? Why would I run?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You three aren't even worthy of making me flee! I was just toying with you before. Now, the real battle is about to begin!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Six burst into laughter, a look of utter disdain on his face. "Toying with us? A battle?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you're delusional!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you have what it takes to fight us? You're still wet behind the ears! Maybe if you had a few hundred years to grow, you could reach a level where you might stand a chance against us. With your talent, a few centuries from now, we might not even be your match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But right now? To us, you're nothing but an insect! Any one of us could squash you like a bug without breaking a sweat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Six wore an arrogant grin, reveling in his own superiority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's smile remained. "Is that so? I remember someone not too long ago who was just as confident, thinking he could squash me like a bug! But funny enough, I'm still here, and he's not.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What was his name again? Oh right! Icy Nine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sudden silence enveloped the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Six, Icy Seven, and Icy Eight froze, disbelief etched across their faces as they stared at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Six snarled, "Icy Nine was killed by your hand? Impossible! Even if you were ten or a hundred times stronger, you could never take down Icy Nine! You expect us to believe that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged, a nonchalant smile appearing on his face. "Whether you believe it or not is your problem! Besides, you're the ones on the brink of death. What does belief even matter now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't you all just head to hell and keep Icy Nine company?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne swung his hand sharply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eclipse of Eternity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of darkness surged forth, enveloping the area for miles around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Osborne's Eclipse Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, merely casting the Eclipse Realm wouldn't be enough to deal with Icy Six and his companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was just a distraction to obscure the outside world's view!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As darkness swallowed the surroundings, Osborne moved swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Draw power! Come to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tapped into the invisible roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, siphoning strength from the bodies of the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that to confront Icy Six and his crew, he needed to suppress their cultivation levels with an absolute forbidden zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his current cultivation level, the absolute forbidden zone wouldn't affect someone like Icy Six, an Ascension Six Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had to elevate his own cultivation level to Ascension Two to effectively suppress Icy Six!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the power of over ten thousand Blood Demon members flowing into him, his cultivation level surged rapidly, racing toward Ascension Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of these Blood Demon members had reached the pinnacle of the Deity King Level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their combined strength was just enough to elevate Osborne from Ascension One to Ascension Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, as he drained the power from the Blood Demon members, his cultivation level temporarily soared to Ascension Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a rush!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he felt the surge of power, a cold smile crept across Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, the moment of the hunt has arrived!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He locked his gaze on Icy Six and his companions within the Eclipse Realm, his expression filled with lethal intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolute forbidden zone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a hum, the blood-red lotus reappeared, exploding into a wave of energy that engulfed Icy Six and his companions, swiftly suppressing their cultivation levels.</span></p><div class="pagination">
