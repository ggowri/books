  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The howling blizzard swallowed Agatha whole. The bone-chilling power it wielded was scarier than the frigid hell of the sixth layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm, and it even put the seventh layer to shame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace didn't believe anyone below the Empyrean Sacredness could stand up to such a biting cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Agatha, you've been cocky! If you'd whipped out your Phoenix Cry Bone Flute and acted at the same time, who knows what would've happened? Maybe my Frost-invoking Canvas would've iced you up first, or maybe your flute would've gotten to me. But now, it's all water under the bridge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your big head's gonna cost you the game!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace cracked a grin. Taking down Agatha meant he'd be untouchable in the state duel. He'd snag the championship title and be crowned the mightiest genius below the Empyrean Sacredness in Zephyr State.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he stared into the snowstorm hiding Agatha, a nagging sense of unease crept over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What the heck is this bad feeling?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of a sudden, the wild blizzard whipped back with a vengeance, and a sharp, ear-splitting screech rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the cry of the phoenix, Horace's face went white as a sheet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic washed over him like a tidal wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way! You're frozen solid by my Frost-invoking Canvas. How in the world can you still blow that flute? I've already won, hands down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a disbelieving yell, but right then, a dizzy spell hit him like a freight train.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A force strong enough to shake his very soul exploded in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace knew he was in deep doo-doo. Just like Agatha had studied his Frost-invoking Canvas, he'd dug into her Phoenix Cry Bone Flute. He knew its deal&mdash;anyone who heard its call would have their soul rattled and fall into a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one below the Empyrean Sacredness had ever managed to dodge its effects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even some Empyrean Sacredness warriors had a tough time dealing with the ancient phoenix call of that flute, a sound that could strike fear into the soul. If one's soul power wasn't up to par, one didn't stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I ain't going down like this!" Horace roared, biting his tongue hard to snap himself out of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a seed-like thing popped up in front of him&mdash;or rather, materialized right on his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The seed sprouted in a flash, sending roots deep into his mind. In an instant, the confusion in his eyes vanished, replaced by a sharp, clear look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he looked kinda weird, with this strange plant growing out of his forehead, giving off a faint purple glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, the phoenix cry stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha stepped out of the swirling snow. Her eyes popped when she saw the odd plant on Horace's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Soul Essence Herb!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't believe you got your mitts on a Soul Essence Herb! It's a super-rare Sacred Elixir, famous for boosting soul power. It roots itself in a person's Soul Current Ocean, making it rock-solid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With the Soul Essence Herb holding your Soul Current Ocean steady, my Phoenix Cry Bone Flute ain't gonna do squat to you now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Agatha finished talking, Horace let out a chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Agatha, you managed to ward off my Frost-invoking Canvas, but I've countered your Phoenix Cry Bone Flute! Now, we're on an even keel! This is when the real showdown starts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha nodded, her face dead serious. "Without that herb, you'd be one hell of an opponent. You're the first guy below the Empyrean Sacredness to resist my Phoenix Cry Bone Flute in years!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too bad for you, though&mdash;you're still gonna bite the dust!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go toe-to-toe and settle this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fierce fire of determination lit up in Agatha's eyes. Twelve Phoenix Skeletal Shields whirled around her like crazy, forming an unbreakable wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the Phoenix Cry Bone Flute in her hand transformed into a sleek, long sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace's expression turned grim, and he let out a cold snort. "Then let's get this over with, face-to-face!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he unfurled the tattered Frost-invoking Canvas, which now took the form of a sturdy wooden staff in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Above him, a small tower hovered&mdash;a defensive Sacred Artifact standing by to protect him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's rumble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, they crashed into each other with such force that the ground of the Arctic Maw Chasm shook like crazy. The sound of their clash reverberated through the chasm, sending shockwaves that made everyone nearby turn pale and back off in a hurry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were scared that the fight between Agatha and Horace might bring the whole place down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the audience in Frost Peak City was glued to the projections of their duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, this is mind-blowing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Horace's Frost-invoking Canvas has been unbeatable until now, but Agatha managed to turn the tables! And Horace was smart enough to use the Soul Essence Herb to withstand Agatha's Phoenix Cry Bone Flute, something no one else could do!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They really live up to their first and second-place rankings! This battle is a real barnburner... They both seem to have the chops to go head-to-head with your average Empyrean Sacredness warriors."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who do you reckon will come out on top?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just like Horace said, the winner'll be the top dog beneath the Empyrean Sacredness in the whole Zephyr State!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was abuzz with excitement, fully expecting a long, drawn-out showdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But boy, were they way off the mark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Agatha and Horace's fight came to a sudden end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha let loose a terrifying Sacred Power, and her attacks were like a freight train.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace's defensive Sacred Artifact crumbled like a house of cards under her might, and his strikes were easily parried by Agatha's twelve Phoenix Skeletal Shields.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he knew it, Horace was on the ropes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was sent flying through the air and crashed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was as white as a sheet, and a trickle of blood ran from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Horace stared up at Agatha, disbelief washed over him like a tidal wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I'm beat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How the hell can your Sacred Power be this strong? It's nuts! We both fused three powers&mdash;how come there's such a huge gap between us?" Horace's frustration was written all over his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha just gave a calm smile. "Beats me, but I'm just better! The moment your Frost-invoking Canvas couldn't touch me, you were done for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flick of her hand, Horace's badge flew right into her palm, and she siphoned off a tenth of his points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd been hovering around 7.8 million points, but now he was just a tad over seven million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Agatha's score shot up close to 11 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She brushed Horace off and turned her eyes in Osborne's direction, as if she could see through the commotion to spot him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I've only got one last fight left! I hope you show up soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Agatha plopped down into a meditative stance, gearing up for what was to come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the flip side, a real doozy of a showdown was about to kick off&mdash;Osborne against Benson!</span></p><div class="pagination">
