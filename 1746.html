  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The six warriors found themselves each facing off against a Deity King warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Hannah was at a disadvantage with her mid-stage Deity Overlord status. Although she was an extraordinary talent, under normal circumstances, she wouldn't stand a chance against a Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she was not Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne had armed her with the Supreme Malevolence Sword and Shield, weapons so potent that they leveled the playing field. Even with her limited strength, she was more than capable of taking down a Deity King warrior with these artifacts in her hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other side, Bryce looked down his nose at Alfred's earlier claims about the Supreme Malevolence Sword being a match-winner, but now all he could say was, "Damn, this Ultimate divine artifact is the real deal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Supreme Malevolence Sword, he had obtained from Osborne after the fall of Aldrich, he swiftly dispatched his opponent in just a few strikes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce's display of power was more impressive than Alfred's, even though he was the unsung hero among the six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His sister Kendra, along with Mila, Zoe, and Anastasia, shone even brighter, each effortlessly defeating </span><span>and even killing </span><span>their adversaries without relying on any Ultimate divine artifacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their skill and confidence left those from Wild Flame City who were watching in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow! So this is the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings?" one bystander gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's terrifying! They aren't even Deity King warriors, yet they easily take down Deity Kings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of monstrous talent do they possess?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're unstoppable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's clear why they dare to call themselves 'the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings.' If they keep growing, we might see seven new super Deity Kings rising!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle raged on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Anastasia, Zoe, and the others basked in the limelight, Osborne's fight drew less attention. He was shrouded in the Eclipse of Eternity, his opponents enveloped in darkness. Even when he defeated them, none could witness the carnage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, having already slain mid-stage Deity King Aldrich, the ordinary Deity Kings he faced now posed little challenge. No one believed they stood a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So when Osborne lifted the veil of Eclipse of Eternity, revealing the lifeless bodies of his five Deity King opponents, no one was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Demonic Dragon Clan and Soaring Lion Clan in Wild Flame City are done for!" someone shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They thought they could buddy up with the Bowman family to take down the Mystic Feather Clan and claim their territory, only to hit a brick wall. The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings flipped the script! This battle has cost the Demonic Dragon Clan and Soaring Lion Clan five Deity Kings and countless Deity Overlords. They've been severely crippled!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At some point, the confidence that had once filled the faces of the Demonic Dragon Clan, Soaring Lion Clan, and Bowman family members vanished, replaced by panic as they began to flee for their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred looked pale, scrambling to board the Supreme Malevolence Airship, his family guards shielding him as he sought to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were terrified!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Osborne, Anastasia, and the others dismantle their Deity King opponents with ease, they finally felt the weight of their fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred's escape didn't go unnoticed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne caught sight of him fleeing and let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can just run? Not a chance! Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alfred had finally boarded a Supreme Malevolence Airship. As the divine power defenses activated, a wave of relief washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ship's defenses were formidable enough that even a Deity King warrior would need time to breach them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He barked, "Let's move! Get us out of here! Activate the Supreme Malevolence Airship's interdimensional travel capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to leave Wild Flame City and return to the Central Zone, back to the Bowman family's place!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The airship hummed to life, its systems powering up as it prepared for interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they could successfully enter the dimensional portal, even a Deity King warrior would be unable to pursue them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the dimensional portal began to open, Alfred finally let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, his gaze turned venomous as he shot a glare in Anastasia's direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn that woman! Today, I may have lost to you, but just wait! I'll be back! The next time we meet, I'll make you beg for mercy and lick my feet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I, Alfred, will return!" he growled under his breath, his anger boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the next instant, the Supreme Malevolence Airship jolted violently. Just as it had entered the interdimensional travel state, it was abruptly thrown out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell is going on?" Alfred's face paled, panic setting in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could comprehend what was happening, a figure appeared before him&mdash;it was Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked, his eyes glinting with a mix of amusement and menace. "Thought you could escape using the airship's interdimensional travel? Too bad you ran into me, someone with spatial power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trying to use interdimensional travel in front of me? That's just wishful thinking!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're better off accepting your fate right here!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
