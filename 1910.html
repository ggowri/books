  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne's expression turned grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't in a rush to enter the divine peak anymore. Instead, he pulled up a map to locate the major cities in the North Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, he found himself near another large city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using his Satan's Eye, he scanned the area and quickly located a military camp nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart sank as he realized the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the Dark Deity Legion's camp, only soldiers below the Celestial Deity level remained. The elite troops, those above Celestial Deity, were conspicuously absent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and activated interdimensional travel once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swiftly made his way through dozens of major cities in the North Zone, discovering that most military outposts were similarly lacking in higher-level warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear they had all been whisked away by the Supreme Malevolence Airships.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And their destination was westward!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, "It seems the Paramount Supreme Clan is truly gearing up for an all-out war against the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elite forces of the Dark Deity Legion are heading for the West Zone, aiming to wipe out the Human Community there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face darkened with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he felt a sense of urgency wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank goodness there's still time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if the Supreme Malevolence Airships are ferrying these elite Dark Deity Legion troops to the West Zone, it'll take them at least six months to arrive! To get everyone in place, it could take half a year, or even a year!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, the Paramount Supreme Clan's full-scale war against the Human Community might erupt within a year! Or perhaps even within six months!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt the pressure of time closing in on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pondered whether his current strength could tip the scales in such a widespread conflict.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't strong enough yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only ones who could truly turn the tide of the battle were the top-tier Supernal Deity Kings. Even ordinary Supernal Deity Kings wouldn't suffice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "I need to hurry! I must boost my strength as quickly as possible, ideally breaking through to become a Supernal Deity King before the war begins!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even stronger would be better! Only then can I ensure my own safety and maybe even change the tide of the battle! Let's get to it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting another moment, Osborne created a Spatial Clone and sent it to Wild Flame City in the East Zone to deal with the challenge arena situation while he himself entered the divine peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gathering Miracle Elixirs and Celestial Crystals was crucial for his power-up, and he couldn't afford to pause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five days flew by in a flash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's main body was still deep in the North Zone's divine peaks, frantically collecting Miracle Elixirs and Celestial Crystals. Meanwhile, his Spatial Clone had already arrived near Wild Flame City in the East Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wild Flame City was eerily quiet, but Osborne could sense a faint undercurrent of danger in the stillness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured, "Heh, it seems the Paramount Supreme Clan is really taking this seriously! They're dead set on trapping all of us here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too bad for them. Their efforts will be in vain!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder how many of their strong members are hiding in the shadows! Let's take a peek!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Spatial Clone not only possessed his spatial power but also wielded Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he scanned the entire Wild Flame City, he could see every nook and cranny clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter where the Paramount Supreme Clan members were concealed, they wouldn't escape his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh? There aren't that many Paramount Supreme Clan members here!" Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He noticed that aside from a group of young talents from the Paramount Supreme Clan on the floating mountain, there were still clusters of their members hidden in every direction&mdash;east, south, west, and north&mdash;around Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly counted the figures hidden throughout the city, and to his astonishment, there were only about four to five hundred of them in total.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he scrutinized the group, his surprise deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them were a staggering twelve Supernal Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three Supernal Deity Kings were positioned in each of the four cardinal directions&mdash;north, south, east, and west.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "Twelve Supernal Deity Kings?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two at Ascension Two and ten at Ascension One? With this kind of power, they could easily wipe out an entire Dukedom Level Power of the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And they've gathered all this just to deal with us? The Paramount Supreme Clan really thinks highly of us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If my main body were to show up here, I'd probably be captured for sure. Even with my spatial power boosted, escaping wouldn't be a guarantee!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the abilities of a Supernal Deity King are beyond imagination!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a cold laugh. "They're making such a big show of wanting to take me down. I wonder if they'd be furious enough to spit blood if I didn't show up? But since I'm here, I might as well entertain you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he executed an interdimensional travel and appeared on the arena atop the floating mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced across the platform at the young geniuses of the Paramount Supreme Clan, a smirk spreading across his face. "Hey, you pathetic wastes from the Paramount Supreme Clan, I'm Theodore! Let's not waste any more time&mdash;come at me all at once!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's words dripped with arrogance, as if he didn't consider the Paramount Supreme Clan members before him worthy of his time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The expressions of the Paramount Supreme Clan's elite turned gloomy in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the hidden warriors from the clan perked up at the sight of Osborne, their eyes gleaming with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Activate the formation!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
