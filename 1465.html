  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All these slaves are Superior Deity from the Human Community&mdash;pretty impressive! My family's mine has recently come under attack from the Deathborn, and we've lost quite a few workers. It's the perfect time to restock!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not only do these Superior Deity human slaves mine faster, but they're also less likely to get into trouble with the Deathborn. They're the best choice for the job!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll take this batch of Human Community slaves!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I bid one million and 500 thousand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! My mine needs skilled workers, too, and human slaves are the best. Just a little incentive, and they'll work tirelessly. Why should I let you have them? I'll raise it to one million and 600 thousand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go for one million and 700 thousand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One million and 800 thousand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The auction buzzed with excitement as the crowd began to compete fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These twenty young male Human Community slaves were prime candidates for dangerous and labor-intensive tasks like mining.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within Wild Flame City, there were only a dozen large mines, but many medium and small ones operated under various factions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To dig for resources, they needed slaves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the powerful factions, these Superior Deity Human Community slaves were the best high-level miners. They could even fight off the Deathborn to protect other workers, making them invaluable. How could anyone pass up such an opportunity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two million!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two million and 100 thousand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two million and 200 thousand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although these male slaves were stronger, all reaching Superior Deity status, their value clearly didn't match that of the previous twenty Intermediate Deity female slaves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, female slaves could be used for various purposes, while male slaves were typically limited to dangerous, labor-intensive work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the price hit two million and 500 thousand, the competition began to dwindle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was unlikely they would fetch more than three million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, Osborne raised his bidding paddle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll bid four million!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The auction hall grew eerily quiet as everyone turned to look at Osborne, their expressions a mix of surprise and skepticism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne hadn't already proven his financial power, they might have thought he was just trying to stir up trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He jumped from two million and 500 thousand straight to four million?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who spent money like that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as Osborne had said before, he had the cash, and he was willing to spend it however he pleased. If they had the money, they could bid like that, too. If not, they could keep quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, no one dared to challenge him this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, he secured the twenty male slaves for four million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then came the third and fourth batches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was undeniable that the slave market's auction was top-notch. Every slave on the block was a gem, not the cheap ones that could be bought for a few thousand or even ten thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each one was a high-quality slave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attendees were buzzing with excitement, but frustration and anger simmered beneath the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, they had seen seven batches of slaves, and yet none had gone home with any of them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had snatched up every single one of the first six batches!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what they bid, Osborne would always outpace them by at least a million, snuffing out any hope of winning the auction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In total, he had spent 30 million Essence Crystals, acquiring nearly 200 human slaves!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana was absolutely thrilled. She couldn't care less about whether the other factions managed to snag the slaves they wanted; all she knew was that this batch had sold for a higher price, thanks to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was more than enough for her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting by Osborne's side, she treated him like the most esteemed guest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This situation drove Zion into furious frustration, leaving him feeling utterly helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, when it came to money, he simply couldn't compete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Representing his family in the slave market, he had to consider the value of each slave, always keeping a mental baseline price in mind. Once the bids exceeded that threshold, Zion had no choice but to walk away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne? Each of his bids shattered Zion's expectations, always surpassing the price he had in mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he possibly compete with that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I really going to walk away empty-handed today? Letting some lowly human scum strut around like he own the place? Absolutely not!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zion glared at Osborne, a flicker of hatred flashing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sensed the animosity radiating from Zion and couldn't help but smirk internally, deciding to ignore him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't afraid of anyone's wealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the money he spent was practically free; he didn't bat an eye at the thought of it. Even if he did run out, he could always sneak into the mines of these major factions and haul away all their Essence Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone who dared to cross him would pay the price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne wore a calm smile, his demeanor even more relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the seventh batch of slaves was auctioned off to him for five million Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then came the eighth batch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, it wasn't a full batch of slaves; instead, only three women were brought up for bidding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three Human Community women!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Three stunning women, all at the Celestial Deity level!</span></p><div class="pagination">
