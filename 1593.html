  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! Everyone, quiet down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Athena's voice cut through the chatter, her gaze sweeping over Osborne, Calvin, and the other eight </span><span>chiliarchs</span><span>. Osborne caught a subtle exchange between Athena and Calvin; she nodded slightly at him, and he responded with a barely perceptible nod of his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Athena's commanding presence, the throng of thousands fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mind raced. "</span><span>So</span><span> they really are in cahoots!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what kind of relationship do they have? Are they just a couple of schemers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought almost made him chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite sensing the hostility from Athena, Calvin, and several other </span><span>chiliarchs</span><span>, he remained unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they want to take me down, they better be ready to pay the price!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they think they can treat me like just another ordinary Celestial Deity chiliarch, they're in for a surprise!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that resolve, Osborne settled into a calm demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next, we're heading to Divine Peak Nine to provide support on the battlefield! From this moment on, you're all under my command. I don't care what your previous situations were; here, you will follow my orders without question. Anyone who dares to defy me will find out just how unpleasant I can be!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After delivering his orders, Athena's gaze swept over the group again, lingering on Osborne with an intensity that was hard to miss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He met her stare with an unflinching calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Athena frowned slightly, taken aback by his composure, but she quickly dismissed it. Right now, she couldn't afford to confront him directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There would be plenty of opportunities once they reached Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued, "Since everyone seems to be on board, I'll take that as agreement! Now, let's get you all organized into teams!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calvin, you're leading the first squad!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gary Borden, you're in charge of the second squad...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you'll lead the tenth squad!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, tell me, is everyone here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being a woman, Athena exuded a powerful presence that demanded respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin was the first to respond, his voice booming, "Reporting to Ms. Athena Huntington! The first squad should have 1111 members, and we're all present&mdash;no absentees!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, Gary shouted, "Reporting to Ms. Athena Huntington! The second squad should have 1111 members, and we're all here&mdash;no absentees!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, it was Osborne's turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Reporting to Ms. Athena Huntington! The tenth squad should have 1111 members, and we're all here&mdash;no absentees!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Athena nodded approvingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember, we're the sixth division of the Wild Flame Army! Once we reach Divine Peak Nine, I expect everyone to be on high alert. It's not a place for the faint-hearted. If you don't follow orders and something goes wrong, don't say I didn't warn you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she waved her hand. "Everyone, board the Malevolence Airship </span><span>immediately! It's a long journey to Divine Peak Nine, taking about two days. Get on in order and choose your rooms. Once you're settled, we'll set off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Madam!" the group responded in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, they hurried onto the Malevolence Airship. As the leader of the tenth squad, Osborne was the last to board.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, when he entered the ship, he found that there were no vacant rooms left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top-grade Malevolence Airship had only 10 thousand rooms, and with the nine squads totaling 9999 members, plus Athena, they filled every last one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, Osborne and his squad would have to make do without private quarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What am I supposed to do now?" he thought, frowning at the prospect of sitting in the aisles or on the deck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this another jab at me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a twinge of uncertainty. After all, each top-grade Malevolence Airship had only 10 thousand rooms, and the other four Malevolence Airships were in the same predicament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was inevitable that at least one squad of a thousand would end up without a place to stay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the rooms were small, they at least offered a bit of privacy for cultivation and rest. Sitting in the cramped aisles or on the deck wouldn't be nearly as comfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After pondering this for a moment, Osborne decided to keep his thoughts to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He found a quiet corner to sit down and discreetly instructed his subordinates to figure things out on their own, choosing not to intervene further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two days to reach Divine Peak Nine on a top-grade Malevolence Airship? Just how far away is it? The Malevolence Airship can hit speeds of up to 180 thousand miles per hour. Even at half that speed, we could cover 4.4 million miles in two days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's quite a distance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I just hope we don't run into any trouble along the way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought settled in his mind, he closed his eyes and focused on enhancing his lightning elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing that Athena and Calvin were plotting against him only fueled his urgency to grow stronger. In such a public setting, Osborne couldn't practice his dark or spatial powers, so he would have to make do with refining his Thunder Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, on the top deck of the Malevolence Airship, two figures stood by the window, observing Osborne in his isolated corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Athena and Calvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin, surprisingly bold, had his arm wrapped around Athena's slender waist, his hand wandering in a way that suggested a familiarity that was anything but professional.</span></p><div class="pagination">
