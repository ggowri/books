  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, Isa, and Maddox eventually checked into the largest and most luxurious inn in Phantom Tide City, </span><span>which was </span><span>designed specifically to accommodate warriors from other planets. It came at a steep price, with each room costing a Celestial Crystal per day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the service was top-notch, with beautiful waitresses who were all Deity Kings, and they enjoyed the protection of Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and Isa shared the same room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the door was closed, Osborne activated his Satan's Eye to scan the surroundings, confirming that there were no surveillance devices monitoring them. He then enveloped the entire room with his Sacred Power, creating a barrier to ensure they wouldn't be spied upon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these precautions in place, he finally relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa, however, felt that Osborne's caution was excessive. "Given our strength, unless the top dog from Necoton Planet, Bancroft from the Phantom Tide Demon Sect, decides to personally come after us, we should be fine here," she pointed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne firmly believed caution was warranted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is our first time crossing the cosmos and visiting another life planet. We're still getting a feel for everything here, so it's better to be careful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He acknowledged that on the surface, Necoton Planet didn't seem too powerful&mdash;there were no Empyrean Sacredness warriors in sight, and aside from Bancroft, there weren't many who could pose a threat. But the uncertainty of hidden dangers lingered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, if word gets out about what we're planning, we could find ourselves facing the entire Phantom Tide Demon Sect. Thousands of Supernal Deity Kings could surround us, and that would be a nightmare."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That concern was not unfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they were investigating the Phantom Tide Demon Sect's involvement in slave trading, which was strictly prohibited in this Stellar Region.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The illicit slave trade between the Phantom Tide Demon Sect and the Paramount Supreme Clan was conducted in the shadows, and if it came to light, it would cause serious trouble for the sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's quest to find his parents meant digging into this slave trade, effectively stirring up trouble for the Phantom Tide Demon Sect, so he had every reason to proceed with caution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then, what's our next move?" Isa asked, feeling a bit lost and unsure of where to start.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Are we really going to just grab a high-ranking Phantom Tide Demon Sect member and grill them about who's in charge of the slave trade?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was deep in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Let's play it by ear. Necoton Planet is different from the Celestara Planet&mdash;it's a transportation hub, and a lot of alien warriors pass through here, so the slave trade is bound to be more covert. Otherwise, someone would've blown the whistle long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only the upper echelons of the Phantom Tide Demon Sect will likely know about their involvement in the slave trade. The regular members probably have no clue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Which means if we're going to grab someone for questioning, it has to be those top-tier folks! They're powerful, and even if I'm confident, making a scene won't do us any favors. We need to wait for the right opportunity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, Isa nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'll go find out more about the higher-ups in the Phantom Tide Demon Sect!" Isa replied, but before she could leave, Osborne quickly grabbed her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's have Maddox handle it instead! It'll be easier for him; his identity as a disciple of the Mystic Sirius Sect will carry some weight here! He can investigate while we hold down the fort here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Osborne's gaze lingered on Isa's stunning figure, his eyes filled with desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped closer, wrapping his arms around her waist and pulling her into his embrace, inhaling her alluring scent. Osborne swallowed hard, feeling the heat of the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa sensed his intentions and shot him a playful glare, but there was no hint of resistance in her expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa wrapped her arms around Osborne's neck, rising on her toes to press her warm, soft lips against his ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bad boy! Trying to pick on me again!" she teased, her breath sending a shiver down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a playful twist, she used her strength to push Osborne down onto the bed, a triumphant smile lighting up her face. "But today, I'm the one on top..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, a confident grin spreading across his face, as if to say, "Bring it on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room soon filled with heavy breaths and Isa's delighted murmurs, the atmosphere thick with energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until a while later that things finally settled down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as they finished putting their clothes back on, a sharp knock echoed through the room. The door swung open, and Maddox rushed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox announced, bowing respectfully, "My Lord, I've got the intel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The true core leadership of the Phantom Tide Demon Sect consists of seven individuals! Besides the leader Bancroft, there are his two brothers, Dahntay and Joakim Brunson, and his sister, Savannah Brunson. Dahntay and Joakim are both at Ascension Nine, while Savannah is at Ascension Eight. Additionally, Bancroft's eldest son, Vince Brunson, is also among the upper ranks, with a cultivation level of Ascension Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then there are Shelvin Mack and Meyers Mack, who are Bancroft's right-hand men, both at Ascension Nine. In short, these seven are the absolute top tier of the Phantom Tide Demon Sect. Only they would know about the slave trade; the others wouldn't have any clue!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Maddox finished, Osborne nodded thoughtfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured, "Bancroft is an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King, while Dahntay, Joakim, Shelvin, and Meyers are all at Ascension Nine. Savannah is at Ascension Eight, and Vince is at Ascension Seven... The Phantom Tide Demon Sect is quite powerful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned slightly and asked, "Maddox, among those seven, who do you think we should go after to have the best shot at success?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox replied with confidence, "Definitely Vince!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's the weakest of the seven, only at the Ascension Seven level. With your strength, my lord, capturing him would be a walk in the park! If everything goes smoothly, we might even be able to keep it under wraps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, as Bancroft's eldest son, Vince is extremely arrogant and looks down on everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've heard that he likes to take a group of gorgeous women out to explore the areas around Phantom Tide City. Although he'll have some warriors guarding him, they're not worth fretting over! Once he leaves the city, that's when we strike!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The other members seldom leave Phantom Tide City, so it's hard to find an opportunity to act."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Maddox appreciatively. "Well done, Maddox! Vince seems to be the ideal target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's make him our top priority. Keep a close watch on him, and the moment he steps out of Phantom Tide City, we'll take action!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a steely glint in his eyes, Osborne added, "Let's get this done!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it!" Maddox replied and then quickly left to put the plan into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After their tender moment, Osborne and Isa got down to a serious training session. His cultivation had reached the Ascension Seven level, but he knew it wasn't sufficient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still didn't have the power to resurrect Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe once I reach Ascension Eight, I'll be able to bring Alfreda back," Osborne murmured, his determination growing stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he cast a time acceleration spell throughout the room, amplifying their training efforts a hundredfold as he and Isa immersed themselves in their cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two days flew by in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, one day, Maddox burst in with exciting news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vince has left Phantom Tide City!" he exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time to move!" Osborne declared, without a moment's hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wrapped up his training and prepared to take action.</span></p><div class="pagination">
