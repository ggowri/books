  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Night could extract Cain's Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity from his body, but why couldn't he finish Cain off entirely?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was simply because Cain's fractured soul was hidden beneath the protective shroud of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the top-tier Deity King couldn't destroy a Cosmic Treasure like the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. Without that capability, there was no way to eliminate Cain, who was shielded by its power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, the God of Night had no choice but to bury both the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity and Cain deep underground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for Osborne's fortunate discovery, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity and Cain might have remained hidden in that solitary abyss for countless years&mdash;until some distant day when tectonic shifts, geographical changes, or a clash between deities unearthed them once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To defeat Cain, Osborne first needed to remove the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity's protection, exposing Cain to his attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For anyone else, this feat would be utterly impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the God of Night couldn't achieve it, but Osborne had a fighting chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't simply because the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity had partially </span><span>merged with his body; it was due to his possession of the Breath of Celestial!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, the Breath of Celestial had drawn nine core energies from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, demonstrating its potential to help Osborne exert a certain level of control over it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Remarkably, even Cain, who had once completed a fifth-stage fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, couldn't claim control over it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To gain such mastery, one needed to achieve a full ten-stage fusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here was Osborne, using the Breath of Celestial to exert a basic level of control. He didn't quite understand why this was possible but considered it a marvel of the Breath of Celestial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more he practiced, the more mysterious it became.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, he suspected that the Breath of Celestial wasn't of this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to devote more time to truly understand the Breath of Celestial! It's not just a tool for power enhancement!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its wonders extend far beyond that!" Osborne mused as the Breath of Celestial began to activate rapidly, reaching toward the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you up to, kid?" Cain frowned, his voice laced with unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An unsettling feeling gnawed at him, a sensation that had saved his life on more than one occasion throughout his long existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed his gaze on Osborne, his voice rising. "What are you really planning?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't seriously think you can draw power from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity again, do you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but smile to himself at Cain's apprehension, but outwardly, he maintained his calm demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just think the core energy of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity could come in handy. So I'm planning to gather a bit more for myself, just to be safe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain's face twisted with rage as he glared at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've lost your mind, kid?! I've told you&mdash;those core energies are crucial for the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity! If it loses any more of that energy, things will go south.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It could revert back into a seed, break free from your body, and take root somewhere in the vast cosmos, eventually restoring itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that happens, no one will ever find it again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You need to stop this, now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain was frantic, convinced that Osborne was hell-bent on hoarding even more core energy from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a calm grin, Osborne replied, "Oh, Cain, you seem a bit too anxious, don't you think? But really, this doesn't concern you anymore. The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity is already mine. Even if it decides to leave my body, you won't lose a thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In fact, you'd be free from it at last!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain's anger reached a boiling point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell are you talking about? That's not the kind of freedom I want! What I desire is..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He faltered mid-sentence, eyes narrowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled coldly. "Oh? So, the freedom you seek isn't this? Then what exactly are you after? Is it the chance to break free from this underground hell and then make a move on my body? Obliterate my soul? Replace me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that's the case, does the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity still belong to you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is that why you're so opposed to me destroying it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain froze, caught off guard. His intentions weren't that straightforward, even if they weren't far from the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimately, his aim was to regain his strength, eliminate Osborne, and reclaim the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with Osborne calling out his hidden motives, he felt exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression hardened with a glint of ice in his gaze. "What do you mean by that, kid?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wore a smirk. "What do I mean?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I mean, I'm going to kill you! You're the God of Sin, for crying out loud. Do you really think I'd trust you? Do you honestly believe we could work together? Besides, I can't let anyone know I possess the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The only way to keep a secret is to silence the source&mdash;permanently."</span></p><div class="pagination">
