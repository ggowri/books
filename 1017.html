  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had faced the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' Class S clones before, having personally taken down a dozen or so. He knew all too well the kind of power they wielded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without the Realm, these clones were undoubtedly the weakest among Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even the weakest Class S was still formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A typical Class AAA wouldn't stand a chance against them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What if the latest clones were even stronger?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thousand Class S clones, even if they were all the weakest of the bunch, were still a terrifying prospect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Osborne's current abilities, if he were surrounded by just fifty of those clones, he'd be dead in the water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even thirty would put his life in serious jeopardy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, deep in thought about his next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The only ace up my sleeve is the Godfather's scepter. Using that scepter two miles around Augustine Estate would supercharge my strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, I wouldn't even flinch in front of top-tier Class S opponents!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I could boost my own rank to Class S while wielding the scepter, I might even take down the strongest Class S in one hit! But even then, I can&rsquo;t defeat Gerardo and those thousand Class S clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization and the League of Divine Descent will surely back the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>. The enemies I'll face will be even stronger and more terrifying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, not only do I need to break through to Class S as quickly as possible, but I also need to gather more allies and resources. The only option I have left is the Blood Demon Organization!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood Cross has absorbed enough blood energy recently to elevate the members of Blood Demon once again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, it should be enough for all of them to reach Class AAA!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Close to five thousand Class AAA members might still fall short against the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' nearly a thousand of Class S clones, but at least we wouldn't be completely defenseless!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, in battle, I can take down enemies and absorb their blood energy to further boost the Blood Demon members. Our strength will only grow with each fight; there's a chance we could turn the tide!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And I can also assemble the special operations team!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We can't just sit and wait at the Augustine Estate; we need to have the ability to strike back! Why should the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> be the only ones on the offensive?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'll swing by the Materials Research Institute and the Weapons Research Institute later. If I can solve the material issues for the super energy guns and mass-produce them, the Blood Demon's power will increase significantly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne stepped outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He instructed Zoe to keep a close eye on Anastasia and to contact him immediately if anything happened. Then he made his way out of Mount Celestial Reach and headed to the Blood Demon's base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon base was located at Mount Three of the Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most members were currently out on patrol, so Osborne called them all back, ready to channel blood energy for their enhancement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, four thousand eight hundred Blood Demon members gathered, eagerly absorbing the blood energy he provided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vibrations of their breakthroughs filled the air, a relentless wave of power that surged through the group. Just as Osborne had hoped, all four thousand eight hundred members broke through to Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne looked at the nearly five thousand Class AAA members of the Blood Demon organization, he was excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the thought of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> quickly sobered him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With over a thousand Class S clones in the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' ranks, the Blood Demon members still had a long way to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of them had yet broken through to Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't their fault; some members like First and Second could already make that leap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only thing holding them back was Osborne's own rank&mdash;still stuck at Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their power could never exceed his. They can&rsquo;t make breakthroughs if Osborne doesn&rsquo;t.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's clear now; I have to break through to Class S as soon as possible! Otherwise, my own limitations will become a roadblock for the Blood Demon members," Osborne thought, scanning members around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These warriors were his backbone in the fight against the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, but right now, they weren't strong enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First!" Osborne called out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine!" First immediately stepped forward, ready for orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, "I want to form a special operations team with just one hundred members for now. I need you to arrange a competition for everyone to identify the top one hundred with the best strength. You'll lead this special team!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This unit will be called the Blood Demon Vanguard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Members of the Blood Demon Vanguard will be the first to gain access to divine </span><span>artifacts. They'll get priority for super energy guns and advanced defensive armor. They will receive priority blood energy supplies and opportunities to break through!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, this team will also take on the most dangerous missions!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bottom line, I'm giving you one day to select the strongest and bravest members. Assemble the Blood Demon Vanguard!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
