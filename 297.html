  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other item he produced was none other than the Death's Edge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Death's Edge cradled in his left hand and the ornate sword sheath in his right, Osborne turned to Isa with a smile that seemed to light up the dim room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come with me to Dampston; they're both yours!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa was momentarily speechless, her gaze locked on the items Osborne was holding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes flickered with intrigue as they traveled to the Death's Edge, the ancient magic weapon of level one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as quickly, she stifled that spark, steeling herself against the allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she was well aware of its significance. She had helped Osborne clean its scent from the Chevalier family not long ago for a whopping sum of 100 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ancient magic weapons were as rare as they were valuable, indeed considered priceless artifacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa scoffed, saying, "Seriously? Do you think I'd just jump at the chance to help you because you dangle Death's Edge in front of me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's a nice thought, but I'm not about to drop everything and risk my neck for a level one magic weapon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, as her gaze shifted to the sword sheath adorned with a perfect diamond the size of a baby's fist, Isa felt her bravado falter, her breath hitching for an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No woman could truly resist the temptation of such a flawless gem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if she was renowned as the Night Witch, Isa was still a woman and a martial artist, one who couldn't ignore the pull of that exquisite diamond in a sheath. Isa swallowed hard, suppressing her desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, ever observant, caught the flicker of need in her eyes and knew he was onto something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He urged, his smile widening, "Isa, please help me out here! I'd feel so much safer with you by my side. Otherwise, I can't shake the fear that trouble could come knocking, and I wouldn't know how to handle it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're gorgeous, clever, and talented; you're practically a lifesaver in a crisis. You'll come, won't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He watched Isa closely, hope lighting up his expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't believe she could say no to such sweet compliments. If she turned him down, he had no backup plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa rolled her eyes dramatically, crossing her arms defiantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a faint blush creeping onto her cheeks, Isa said, "You buttering me up like that? You're lucky it doesn't make my skin crawl. But I'll admit, it's kinda nice to hear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, at least you know talent when you see it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just hand over the sword and the sheath! And don't get it twisted. I'm not doing this just for the promises of shiny treasures. It's for our friendship!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overjoyed, Osborne exclaimed, "Isa, you're really saying yes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rolled her eyes again, raising her voice just a notch. "Hurry up and pass me that sword sheath!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, Osborne eagerly handed over both the Death's Edge and the sword sheath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa casually tossed the Death's Edge aside, her focus utterly consumed by the beautifully crafted sheath, her eyes lighting up as they locked onto the flawless diamond embedded within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That kind of perfection had a way of snagging a woman's attention like nothing else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Isa found herself pulled into its allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, in what could only be described as a teasing tone, she said, "So, tell me. Did that lipstick mark on your face come from another woman who received gifts similar to this one?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's cheeks flushed as he realized he had been caught, but he remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa, however, had already formed her own conclusions. To his surprise, a hint of </span><span>jealousy flashed across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get over here," Isa commanded, her voice firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh... What's up?" Osborne approached, confusion knitting his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you hear me? Get over here, now!" Isa insisted, her tone sharper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He complied willingly, though uncertainty lingered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, before he could process what was happening, Isa leaned in and pressed a quick peck to his cheek - an ephemeral kiss, like a dragonfly skimming the surface of a pond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood there, frozen in shock, eyes wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa, her cheeks now mildly flushed, said coolly, "Don't go reading into this. I just don't like being in anyone's debt, and I sure as hell won't let some other woman get one up on me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Isa clutched the sword sheath tightly and strode out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to get my things in order; it'll take me two days! Ugh, switching locations again is such a hassle! But what can I say? A witch's promises are sacred!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"See you in Dampston!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll bring your two sisters along, so don't worry about them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, she had already disappeared into her room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rubbed the spot on his cheek where Isa had kissed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warmth lingered, and he couldn't shake the strange sensation it left behind. But the thought of Isa agreeing to help him in Dampston filled him with a rush of enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just how strong was Isa? Osborne had no clue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was like a bottomless pit. Every time Osborne thought he had caught up to her, she'd pull some move that reminded him just how far behind he really was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just recently, Isa gave him invaluable tips on combat techniques that significantly improved his skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, Isa was a powerhouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, heading to Dampston, he felt the weight of uncertainty. Osborne knew nothing about the place, and the enemies he would face were the local tough guys - no small potatoes, that was for sure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, Osborne didn't have much faith in his chances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with Isa by his side, he finally felt a flicker of confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why he had hurriedly asked Alison to design that sword sheath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa, being the pure martial artist she was, had no defenses against the allure of a sheath with perfectly set diamonds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, Osborne gifted a pink staff to Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe, taking a page out of Isa's book, blushed and planted a firm kiss on his cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed, a mix of exasperation and amusement, but he let it slide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, he was on his way, but his mind drifted to a familiar figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was his last lingering thought from Skyefall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After bidding her farewell, he would finally be free to head to Dampston with a clear mind.</span></p><div class="pagination">
