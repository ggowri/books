  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying power of the Luminous Elven Wings erupted fully, and the Sacred Power blades shot toward Osborne, striking his Eclipse War Armor in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt the weight of the attack; even his formidable armor couldn't withstand it completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The armor began to show cracks, and within mere moments, it was on the verge of shattering, leaving Osborne exposed and vulnerable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression grew serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you going to activate your absolute forbidden zone or not? If you don't, you're going to lose!" Alfreda taunted, her voice laced with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne merely smiled, a hint of calm determination in his eyes, "No rush!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he flickered and vanished from sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Phantom Steps!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's Sacred Power blades were fast, but Osborne had a trick up his sleeve. His mastery of space elemental essence had reached level ten, and with the fusion of dark elemental essence at the same level, he had created a new Sacred Power essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made his control over spatial power even stronger, allowing him to perform interdimensional travel with ease and speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Alfreda's attacks were swift, they couldn't keep up with his spatial maneuvers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, he reappeared right behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He called out, "Alfreda, let's see how you handle my attack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eclipse Destructive Ray!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the shattered remnants of his Eclipse War Armor, a torrent of pitch-black rays shot forth, racing toward Alfreda in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The armor not only provided a robust defense but also absorbed the energy from her earlier attacks, storing it for a powerful counterstrike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, Alfreda had nearly shattered Osborne's Eclipse War Armor with her Sacred Power blade, and in the process, the armor had absorbed a terrifying amount of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, countless Eclipse Destructive Rays converged on Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! That annoying spatial power!" she muttered, but she didn't panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, the vibrant Luminous Elven Wings flared out behind her, wrapping around her in a protective embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Eclipse Destructive Rays collided with the Luminous Elven Wings, creating a dazzling display of colors as the impacts reverberated through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the chaos settled, Alfreda emerged unscathed, her wings still shining brightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in disbelief. "Such strong defense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but feel a twinge of envy. Not only did the Luminous Elven Wings come with inherent Sacred Power and impressive attack capabilities, but they also boasted incredible defensive strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he didn't have his own Sacred Power, he might have been overwhelmed, even with his higher cultivation level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alfreda, too, was taken aback, her brow furrowing as she examined her radiant wings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a powerful attack! If it were just a bit stronger, I might not have been able to hold my ground! Did it reflect some of my own force?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, "Well, Alfreda, here comes another one!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If this doesn't break through your Luminous Elven Wings, I'll have to pull out my absolute forbidden zone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's eyes widened in surprise. "You have an even stronger attack?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without answering, Osborne slowly extended his right hand. A swirling sphere of pitch-black energy began to form in his palm, collapsing and compressing with a terrifying force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dimensional Maw!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He roared as the Dimensional Maw took shape in his hand, and at that moment, the very air around them seemed to tremble in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't just any Dimensional Maw; it was powered by Sacred Power essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne warned, his voice steady, "Be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, he hurled the Dimensional Maw toward Alfreda, the energy surging forward like a dark comet, ready to unleash its devastating power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Dimensional Maw streaked through the air, reality itself warped around it, even the light struggling to escape its pull.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's expression hardened dramatically, a wave of dread washing over her. Instinctively, she tried to retreat, hoping to evade the oncoming attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dimensional Maw wasn't particularly fast, but the moment she thought to back away, Osborne flashed a knowing smile. "Running away? It's too late for that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gravity surge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that command, the terrifying gravitational force that Osborne had kept in check suddenly erupted from the Dimensional Maw, locking onto Alfreda's location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes widened in horror as she felt the overwhelming force bear down on her. Desperately, she unleashed her divine power, attempting to escape its grasp, but it was futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this even possible?" Alfreda exclaimed, panic creeping into her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power emanating from the Dimensional Maw was so immense that she realized her Luminous Elven Wings might not hold up against it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, the horrific gravitational pull pinned her in place, and no amount of frantic flapping of her wings would get her away from the impending doom. All Alfreda could do was watch as the small, fist-sized Dimensional Maw barreled toward her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is bad!" She bit her lip, knowing that escape was impossible now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a burst of determination, Alfreda activated her Luminous Elven Wings, surrounding herself in a blinding brilliance for extra protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then it happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dimensional Maw slammed into her wings with a force akin to a comet striking the planet, unleashing a shockwave of energy that sent Osborne reeling backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he regained his footing, curiosity filled his expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would Alfreda be able to withstand the power of the Dimensional Maw?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't too concerned about her safety; earlier, he had taken the precaution of secretly replicating her life essence before they entered the Umbra Earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if things went south, he could bring her back, untouched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What intrigued him was whether his current strength could shatter the defenses of her Luminous Elven Wings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time seemed to stretch as the explosion subsided, silence enveloping the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Osborne caught a glimpse of Alfreda, and relief flooded through him. She was still standing, her body unscathed, albeit her Luminous Elven Wings were battered and dimming, barely holding together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he saw the state of her wings, a sigh escaped Osborne's lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a furrowed brow, he mused, "So close! Dimensional Maw was my strongest attack yet, and still, it didn't fully breach her defenses or hurt her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without the absolute forbidden zone, defeating Alfreda with my current strength is going to be a challenge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No longer hesitating, he declared, "Absolute forbidden zone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A vibrant image of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity erupted into the air, manifesting its power as it quickly suppressed Alfreda's cultivation level, reducing it to Ascension Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring at her once-magnificent Luminous Elven Wings, now on the brink of destruction, Alfreda felt the weight of her new reality. Her cultivation status diminished, and she was left in a state of shock and resignation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her Luminous Elven Wings had nearly shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another hit like that, and they would break for sure&mdash;not to mention, she'd be at serious risk of losing her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer power of the Dimensional Maw left her shaken and filled with dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now with her cultivation level reduced to Ascension Four, Alfreda recognized that she stood no chance against Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a resigned sigh and a playful pout, she voiced her defeat. "I give up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, you're the boss, and I'm your loyal little follower!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And with that, there was a mix of disappointment and acceptance etched on her face.</span></p><div class="pagination">
