  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne called out loudly, but it was too late.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett had already made his move. He knew Cuthbert was strong, and he couldn't pose much of a threat. His only hope was to force Cuthbert to use a third attack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as he stepped onto the stage, Rhett unleashed his Flame Realm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Good timing!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert smiled faintly before suddenly making his move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a smirk, Cuthbert threw a punch. Just like before, Rhett's Flame Realm shattered in an instant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Normally, Cuthbert would have followed up with another punch to knock Rhett out of the arena.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All Rhett could do was block and hope to see Cuthbert's third move. If he couldn't, he'd end up like the others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But this time, things were different.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert didn't just punch Rhett off the stage. Instead, he moved swiftly, appearing beside Rhett and grabbing his shoulder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett's expression changed drastically as he tried to summon all his strength to push Cuthbert away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is this all you've got?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert smiled coldly, unfazed by Rhett's effort. He grabbed Rhett's shoulder and slammed him hard onto the stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett's body hit the stage with a loud crash, and everyone could hear the sickening sound of bones cracking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Broken bones pierced through his skin, and blood spilled everywhere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Cuthbert didn't stop there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett was like a ragdoll in his hands, as Cuthbert flung him around, slamming him repeatedly onto the stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bam!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bam!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bam!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Within moments, Rhett was barely conscious. The intense pain made him scream. In Cuthbert's grasp, he was utterly powerless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By now, Aleena, Stuart, Vivian, Osborne, and Emma were all on their feet, glaring furiously at Cuthbert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stop it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aleena shouted angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately, Cuthbert ignored her, slamming Rhett one last time, making sure every bone in his body was shattered before throwing him off the stage with a cold laugh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Next!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thud!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett's battered body hit the ground with a thud, leaving the spectators in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But no one was more stunned than the Lambert family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They rushed to Rhett's side. Aleena cradled him. Her eyes welled with tears as she felt the extent of his injuries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She glared furiously at Cuthbert on the stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Cuthbert, you're despicable! It was just a normal challenge, and you did this to him? Was this deliberate? Why did you do it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aleena was trembling with rage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert glanced at her indifferently and smiled. "Is there a problem? On the stage, it's life or death. I didn't kill him, did I? If he's going to challenge me, he should be prepared to get seriously hurt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If the Lambert family fears getting hurt, you don't have to challenge me. No one's going to call you cowards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aleena was speechless, clenching her fists in frustration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart shouted angrily, "Cuthbert, you did this on purpose! You didn't seriously injure any of the twenty challengers before. Why did you go so far this time?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is your Honor Quest Ceremony. You should be conserving your strength, not wasting it. Why go out of your way to injure him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you deliberately targeting the Lambert family?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart's eyes were bloodshot with rage, and he looked like he wanted to tear Cuthbert apart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert smiled calmly. "Yes, I did it on purpose, but I wasn't targeting the Lambert family specifically. It's just strategy. By seriously injuring him, I can intimidate the other challengers and save myself some energy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you want to blame someone, blame his bad luck for being the one I chose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There's no issue with that, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert's face was full of amusement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart was trembling with anger, but there was nothing he could do. Everyone knew Cuthbert had intentionally injured Rhett and targeted the Lambert family, but they couldn't do anything about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert hadn't broken any rules.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the very least, he hadn't killed Rhett. As for how serious Rhett's injuries were? No one cared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As long as he wasn't dead, it didn't matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Lambert family, please stop disrupting the Honor Quest Ceremony!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, a powerful member of the Williamson family spoke coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There's nothing wrong with Cuthbert's actions. It's just part of his strategy! Please return to your seats immediately and stop interrupting the ceremony!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing this, the members of the Lambert family grew even more furious.</p><div class="pagination">
