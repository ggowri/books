  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was twisted with a cold smirk as he continued to ignore the attacks from the others, focusing solely on the late-stage Deity King of the Paramount Supreme Clan. He pounced on his target like a rabid dog, unleashing a barrage of attacks with unbridled fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This display left the onlookers stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery thought, "What is he doing? Does he think he's a goner and wants to drag someone down with him to hell?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isn't he going to try and fight back?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Can he even do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery frowned deeply, his expression one of confusion. In his eyes, Osborne's actions were utterly foolish and made no sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had no time to dwell on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Full power, kill him quickly! We have so many people surrounding him; if he still manages to take one of us down, we'll all be humiliated! Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless attacks rained down on Osborne, even more intense and overwhelming than before, all aimed at ending his life swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained defiant, seemingly oblivious to the attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued his relentless assault, his body crackling with lightning as he accelerated towards his target. Instead of attacking, Osborne grabbed the Deity King's shoulder, his strength surging as he clamped down with a vice-like grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, dragging the man along, he charged straight into the hail of attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is he trying to kill himself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, everyone was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Paramount Supreme Clan's Deity King, whose shoulder was in Osborne's grip, was filled with terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He erupted with all his might, desperate to break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! You lunatic! You want to die, but I don't! Let go of me! You freak!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man struggled mightily, pummeling Osborne in a desperate bid to loosen his grip, but it was futile. Osborne's body radiated a terrifying force, and no matter how hard he fought, he couldn't break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're coming with me whether you like it or not!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's cold laugh echoed as he faced the impending barrage of attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, a dozen attacks struck Osborne, and along with him, the Paramount Supreme Clan's Deity King at his side was also struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aaaah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A blood-curdling scream pierced the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The late-stage Deity King, despite his power, couldn't withstand the combined assault of a dozen late-stage Deity Kings and a peak Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His divine power defenses crumbled instantly, and his Divine Body shattered under the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his final moments, he saw Osborne's Divine Body breaking apart as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madman! You're a madman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raged internally, but it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was filled with regret, wishing he had kept his distance from Osborne, but there was no turning back now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, this Deity King died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after, Osborne's Divine Body, battered and broken by Hubery and the others, disintegrated as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was dead, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery and the others ceased their attacks, their faces gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Osborne was dead, he had successfully dragged a late-stage Deity King of the Paramount Supreme Clan to his grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was unacceptable to them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone felt a burning shame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearly twenty late-stage and peak Deity Kings had surrounded a single early-stage Deity King from the Human Community and still lost one of their own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a slap in the face, and a harsh one at that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank heavens, he's finally dead! And with his death, all those in his Dimensional Microcosm will die, too! He had at least 10 thousand Celestial Crystals and five Miracle Elixirs on him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As someone spoke, everyone's eyes lit up with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They turned their gaze to where Osborne had fallen, searching for the Dimensional Microcosm or Dimensional Bag he might have left behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they found nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's faces turned to shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can it be gone? He clearly died here, so why is there nothing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as they were puzzled, a mocking voice rang in their ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looking for my 'relics,' are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden voice sent a shiver down their spines. They all looked up sharply, their gazes fixing on Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing atop Divine Peak Nine was a tall, imposing figure, smirking at them with eyes full of derision and contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who else could it be but Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Hubery and the others were stunned, their eyes wide with disbelief as they stared at Osborne in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We saw with our own eyes that Theodore's Divine Body shattered completely under our combined attack, turning into nothing but shredded flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dead, utterly dead. So why is he standing on Divine Peak Nine now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could we have just killed a clone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought sent Hubery into a rage, his eyes burning with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! After him!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
