  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mind raced as he processed the situation. "Over 300 Class S Dark Exotic Beasts?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And some of them are top-tier Class S?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We've already taken down more than a hundred, so how are there still so many left?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is this place really a Dark Exotic Beast nest?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there wasn't time to ponder that now. The sheer power of three hundred Class S Dark Exotic Beasts was overwhelming enough to wipe out most superpowers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it hadn't been for Blood Demon Vanguard, even Osborne would be in deep trouble facing such a horde.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them all!" Osborne commanded as the Dark Exotic Beasts surged from the cave </span><span>ahead, charging toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of Blood Demon Vanguard sprang into action, shifting into battle mode. While they had encountered plenty of Class S Dark Exotic Beasts before, their numbers had been so small that they posed no real threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, however, things were different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With over three hundred Class S Dark Exotic Beasts, including several elite ones, they couldn't afford to be careless. Though they might not be overwhelmed, they could certainly suffer casualties if they didn't take this seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fierce battle erupted in the depths of the earth, twelve miles down. Ninety members of Blood Demon Vanguard faced off against the 300 Class S Dark Exotic Beasts. It was no easy fight, but it wasn't insurmountable either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, everyone in Blood Demon Vanguard was a top-tier Class S warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After about ten minutes of intense combat, they had slain every last one of the 300 Class S Dark Exotic Beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rich blood energy that flooded the area sent a thrill through Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First, you and the Blood Demon Vanguard team stay here. If any Dark Exotic Beasts come through any of the passages, take them out immediately! We cannot let them escape the rift and reach the surface!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First nodded. "Got it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued, "Anastasia, Zoe, I need you to head back to the surface. Deliver my orders to the other Blood Demon members and have them come to reinforce us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The number of Dark Exotic Beasts here far exceeds my expectations, and relying solely on Blood Demon Vanguard might not be enough to guarantee our safety."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia exchanged a worried glance with Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what about you?" she asked, concern etched on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "I'm planning to delve deeper and investigate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia frowned. "No way! Zoe said the mental strength disturbance here is incredibly strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even top-tier Class S warriors can be affected over time! If you go deeper, the disturbance will only intensify. I can't let you take that risk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, Osborne, you can't take chances like that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling their concern, Osborne ruffled their hair. "Don't worry about me. The reason I'm willing to go deeper is that I have special mental strength defenses. This level of disturbance won't affect me at all! Even if it were ten or a hundred times stronger, I'd still be fine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's brow furrowed in doubt. "Are you sure?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course! I wouldn't joke about my life," he reassured her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But... even if the disturbance won't get to you, there could be more and stronger Dark Exotic Beasts down there. We can't just let you go alone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's tone turned soothing. "That's exactly why I'll be safer on my own! Don't forget, I have spatial power! If anything feels off, I can bail out at a moment's notice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Anastasia and Zoe couldn't convince him otherwise. They exchanged </span><span>glances filled with concern but knew better than to argue further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got to be careful, alright? If something happens to you, we'll charge in there! And if you die, well... we're not sticking around either," Anastasia said earnestly, her voice filled with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gently caressed her cheek. "Alright, I'll be cautious! Head back up and wait for my good news."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, his gaze shifted to the three tunnels before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each one was labyrinthine and pitch-black; even with his Satan's Eye at Level Seven, he couldn't fathom what lay at their depths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimately, Osborne chose one and stepped inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The 300 Class S Dark Exotic Beasts that had previously emerged from this very passageway had Osborne suspecting that there was something amiss deep within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tunnel was eerily silent, and he leaned against the wall as he moved forward, keeping his Satan's Eye active. In case of any anomaly, Osborne could react instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel the mental strength disturbances growing stronger with each step deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this intensity, even top-tier Class S warriors would quickly succumb to madness, enduring irreversible mental damage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne wasn't worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had Isa's Soul Barrier&mdash;a soul defense technique that, once mastered, significantly boosted spiritual defense, shielding against most psychic and soul attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Soul Barrier in place, the mental disturbances had no effect on him whatsoever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Osborne had ventured six miles in.</span></p><div class="pagination">
