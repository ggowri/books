  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what do we do now?" Wesson frowned as he asked. "The strength of League of Divine Descent is unfathomable. If they send even a small reinforcement, I'm afraid we won't stand a chance against them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly and said coldly, "No need to worry. I have my ways. No matter how powerful the League of Divine Descent is, they can't summon too many warriors on short notice. What we have to do is to kill them all!" After a quick glance at the battlefield, he turned his attention away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, the situation on the battlefield was crystal clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over 300 Class S clones from the Aberrants had already lost more than a hundred soldiers, leaving just 200 standing. On the other hand, while the League of Divine Descent had suffered close to 20 losses, they still had over 60 fighters left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this rate, if Everett and his team wanted, they could easily wipe out the remaining Aberrant clones, and at least fifty of them would survive the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as Osborne had predicted, Everett and his team gradually slowed down their attacks, feigning exhaustion as if their strength waned. They preferred to take more casualties rather than finish the battle swiftly, deliberately drawing things out to maintain the current stalemate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were clearly stalling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, their act was so convincing that most people couldn't see through it. Many believed they were genuinely locked in a grueling struggle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they want to drag this out, let them," Osborne sneered inwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, "Wesson, keep an eye on them. I'm going to make some preparations. And remember, don't push them. Let them continue to tear each other apart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson nodded firmly, though he was worried. He had no idea what Osborne was planning, nor could he understand why Osborne was so confident. The League of Divine Descent's reinforcements were undoubtedly no small matter. Could they really handle what was to come?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson couldn't help but feel a deep sense of dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't bother to explain. Instead, he looked at the Blood Demon members. In the next moment, his voice echoed inside First Augustine's mind, "First Augustine, gather every member of the Blood Demon Vanguard and select 300 more Blood Demon members who are closest to reaching Class S. Bring them to me, but be discreet. No one should notice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, Osborne vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First Augustine's expression shifted slightly, but he wasted no time in carrying out Osborne's orders. Soon, from among the 4,800 Blood Demon members, 400 of them began to quietly retreat from the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With everyone focused on the fierce fighting, no one noticed the subtle withdrawal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, 100 Blood Demon Vanguard members and 300 ordinary Blood Demon fighters had gathered in a dense forest several miles away, where Osborne was already waiting for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine!" The group greeted Osborne with respectful salutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glanced over them, nodding with a faint smile. "Alright, keep it quiet. The reason I brought you here is to help you break through to Class S!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a stream of energy, dark and liquid-like, appeared before Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Osborne had already seen through the League of Divine Descent's plan and knew reinforcements would surely arrive, how could he not prepare?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Osborne didn't have reinforcements, he could enhance the strength of the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Cross within Osborne's body surged with immense blood energy. By his calculations, this power would be enough to push 500 Blood Demon members to break through to Class S once condensed into energy blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne decided to share this blood energy among only 400 members for their ascension to ensure absolute success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Four hundred drops of crimson energy blood hovered in the air, each glowing red. The sight alone sent shivers of excitement through the bodies of the Blood Demon members. They could feel it. This energy held the key to their transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go!" Osborne commanded with a wave of his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The 400 drops of energy blood appeared before each Blood Demon member. They consumed the blood without hesitation and immediately began to absorb and refine its potent energy. In an instant, their bodies started to change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could sense it clearly. After taking in the energy, each one was on the verge of a breakthrough. And because of their unique constitution, no bottlenecks stood in their way. No barriers they needed to forcefully break through to reach Class S. As long as they had enough energy, they would ascend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A low hum filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First Augustine was the first to break through. Then came the second, the third...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, reaching Class S wasn't the end. Their bodies still had to undergo a metamorphosis before their combat abilities would fully evolve. It would take some time before they could wake up and unleash their full potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the last Blood Demon member had successfully broken through to Class S, Osborne finally breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A shame," Osborne muttered, "this energy should have been enough to push 500, maybe even 600, to Class S. But this might be for the best. They've absorbed excess energy, making them stronger than most who just reached Class S."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Four hundred Class S fighters," Osborne murmured, his eyes cold and filled with murderous intent. "League of Divine Descent, you want to play dirty? Fine. Let's see who has the last laugh."</span></p><div class="pagination">
