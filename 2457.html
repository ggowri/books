  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The first person walked toward Ian, bowed respectfully, and handed a Dimensional Bag to Ian.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"General Ian Augustine, I am Doug Shelton from Black Gale Valley. My master is... I admire you immensely, and it&rsquo;s such an honor to meet you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Doug's face turned red, as if he were meeting his idol.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Actually, Doug hadn't achieved much, and he knew he couldn't achieve great results. The reason he stepped out first was to get to know and curry favor with Ian.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was a disciple with Second-rate Power. If Ian liked him and invited him to join the Glorious Divine Legion as a warrior under Ian's command, his fate would change.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, he was extremely respectful to Ian.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian was very pleased with this. He believed this was exactly how a disciple with Second-rate Power should behave in front of him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In contrast, Osborne's behavior seemed bizarre to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian encouraged Doug to open his Dimensional Bag and take out all his gains, letting them float in mid-air before him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Ian quickly began tallying with the chief judge Gerald and the others behind him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"These can be exchanged for a total of 650,000 Kingdom Duel Scorepoints. Not bad!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian said calmly, "You should keep up the effort! Once you break through to the ultimate Empyrean Sacredness, you can come to the Third Division of the Glorious Divine Legion to find me. If you pass my test, I'll give you a chance to join my Immortal Guard!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing that he would have a chance to become one of Ian's Immortal Guard after breaking through Empyrean Sacredness, Doug became very excited and gratefully thanked Ian.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Next!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the second person rushed over as well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was also a disciple with Second-rate Power. Like Doug, he was equally excited, trying every possible way to curry favor with Ian, hoping Ian would let him join the Immortal Guard to change his fate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Ian never made direct promises, only telling them to find him after breaking through Empyrean Sacredness. They could join his legion only after passing the test.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even so, everyone was incredibly excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even some disciples with First-rate Power couldn't help but feel tempted. In terms of status, elite disciples with First-rate Power ranked higher than the soldiers of the Glorious Divine Legion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, compared to Ian's Immortal Guard, they were still lacking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Ian was a three-star general and a member of the royal Augustine family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if Ian was only a member of the branch bloodline, he was still royalty.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In such a situation, everyone scrambled to flatter Ian, while also having him record their achievements to exchange for Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Brenda was not in a hurry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As an elite disciple of Skyearth Dominion, although Brenda was respectful to Ian, she neither fawned over him nor intended to become a member of Ian's Immortal Guard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Brenda planned to wait until everyone else finished reporting before going over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, her achievements would surely astonish everyone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Brenda sneered as she looked at Osborne. Noticing Osborne staring blankly at Ian with a complicated expression, she immediately scoffed, "Has Osborne gone dumb?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Probably he never expected General Ian Augustine to suddenly show up and become a witness to our bet. If he had realized this earlier, he might not have dared to make the bet with me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, it's all too late!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If General Ian Augustine is our witness, Osborne definitely wouldn't dare to back out or cheat. His Warfare Shield and Bloodwrought Bow will soon be mine!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Brenda finished speaking, her face was full of confidence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The people around her also chuckled softly, "Osborne is so foolish! Loose lips sink ships. If he weren't so arrogant and kept a low profile, he wouldn't have ended up as a laughingstock like this."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He even said you couldn't make it to the top three."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Haha! That's ridiculous! Even a fool knows you're bound to be the champion this time. Falling out of the top three? Impossible!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Unless someone cheats..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But General Ian Augustine and countless viewers are here, and they're watching this through projections on Racial Convergence Planet. Who would dare to cheat? Who could even pull it off?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone looked at Osborne with disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, they didn't know that Osborne no longer cared about the outcome of the bet. He was staring at Ian simply because he knew him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian was a member of the Augustine family, the royal family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom. Although he was only part of a branch bloodline, Osborne had met him in his previous life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, Osborne was still a prince of the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Osborne was a prince, his mother was merely a maid, or rather a servant, by the Glorious Divine Emperor's side. Her low status caused Osborne to always be looked down upon by the other princes and princesses in the royal family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, among the royal princes and princesses, Osborne's talent in his previous life could only be considered average, if not the worst...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, everyone looked down on him even more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other princes and princesses always found various opportunities to bully him. At that time, even princes and princesses with lower abilities than him could easily defeat and bully him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sometimes, the other princes and princesses couldn't even be bothered to fight him themselves. Instead, they had their guards and subordinates teach Osborne a lesson.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each time, they would beat Osborne half to death and then have someone heal his injuries to prevent others from finding out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such things happened almost every day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian in front of Osborne was one of those who had beaten him before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne remembered that Ian was a guard of Prince Brent Augustine at the time, always following Brent around and flattering him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brent was Osborne's younger brother in his previous life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, Brent was one of the princes and princesses who most enjoyed bullying and humiliating Osborne. He had countless times personally or ordered his guards to beat and humiliate Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian was always at the forefront every time!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That seemed to have happened over a thousand years ago. At that time, Osborne was just the Supernal Deity King, while Ian was already a warrior who had reached Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne would never forget Ian.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He would never forget how Ian beat, humiliated, and tortured him to please Brent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, when Osborne saw Ian, he was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was lost in memories of his past life, which made him appear frozen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne finally began to come to his senses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He shifted his gaze away from Ian and lowered his head, a chilling murderous intent flashing through his eyes. </span><span>He c</span><span>lenc</span><span>hed</span><span> his fists</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Ian, damn it!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Osborne had been reincarnated once, the memories of his past life still vividly lingered in his mind. He had not forgotten, nor had their hatred been resolved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone who once beat or humiliated him must pay the price.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this life, Osborne would unleash all his hatred with his own strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian was just one of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne dared not reveal his killing intent, because after over a thousand years, Ian had already reached Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection. Right now, Osborne was far from being his match.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just wait and see!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll come for revenge soon! Ian is just one of them, and there are more royal members, including those princes and princesses, their subordinates, their queens, and...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Glorious Divine Emperor is not a qualified father.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I will take revenge on each of you one by one!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
