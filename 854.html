  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just one more month! That's all I need to wait!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gerardo suddenly became agitated, his already blood-red eyes now blazing like a deep abyss, instilling fear in anyone who dared to meet his gaze.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">George trembled slightly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although he was a top-tier Class AAA powerhouse, in front of Gerardo, he felt like nothing more than an ant&mdash;an ant that Gerardo could crush without a second thought.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Aniston, I've arrived."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A calm voice came as a tall, slender figure walked into the room.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She glanced at the terrified George and then at the excited Gerardo, her expression serene as if she was completely unfazed by Gerardo's overwhelming presence.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, Gerardo's agitation subsided, replaced by a look of surprise.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ophelia, what a pleasant surprise! Have you run into some difficulties in your training?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Osborne had been present, he would have been shocked to see that the slender figure was none other than his ex-wife&mdash;Ophelia!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked more gaunt than before, her demeanor cold, radiating an indescribable aura.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even in the face of Gerardo, she remained remarkably composed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've encountered some issues and wanted to consult with Mr. Aniston, but since George has matters to discuss with you, I can come back later," Ophelia replied, preparing to leave.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ophelia, I've finished my report. Your concerns are far more important; I'll leave right away," George interjected, his tone almost sycophantic.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ophelia paused, raising an eyebrow. "George, I overheard you mention the Augustine family and Osborne. What's going on? Can you fill me in?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">George's expression stiffened at her words as he glanced at Gerardo.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gerardo nodded at him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since Ophelia has asked, you can tell her the truth. She's not an outsider."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, sir!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">George quickly recounted the news about the Augustine family planning to hold an Honor Quest Ceremony for Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ophelia's face remained calm, but a keen observer would notice the turmoil in her eyes, revealing her inner unrest.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She murmured, her voice low, but the anger simmering beneath was unmistakable, "Has Osborne really come this far?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How dare he hold an Honor Quest Ceremony? How has he become so powerful?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, just wait! I'll catch up to you soon and surpass you! I won't forget how cold you've been towards me! When the time comes, I'll make you beg for my forgiveness!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that icy declaration, Ophelia turned on her heel and walked away.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ophelia, didn't you have questions for me?" Gerardo called after her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need, I've figured it out!" Ophelia replied.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before anyone could say another word, she vanished.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gerardo watched her disappear, his eyes sparkling with newfound joy.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Aniston, don't you think you're being a bit too nice to Ophelia?" George couldn't help but ask; his tone tinged with envy.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gerardo regarded him coolly. "If you could go from an ordinary person to Class AA in just a month, I'd treat you the same way! If you had mastered time power, I'd be just as generous!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Unfortunately, you lack that kind of talent!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Gerardo turned to leave. "Remember my orders! Sabotage Osborne's Honor Quest Ceremony and look for a chance to take him out! In a month, I want to return to Rosmandi with all the 'hyenas' and 'wolves' and sweep everything aside!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, sir!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">George bowed respectfully, only straightening up once Gerardo had vanished.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He gazed at the massive Minotaur corpse beyond the glass window, excitement flickering in his eyes.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the other side, in the depths of the ocean, stood a circular island housing one of the Eityreia Organization's main headquarters.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the world's top assassin organization, it exuded an air of menace and power.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the highest point of the island, a young woman stood, her expression calm yet intense.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Any word from Mose?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Reporting to you, Blood Princess. We've received news. Mose is dead. We confirmed it with the Williamson family. The one who killed him is named 'Axell,' but that's just an alias. His true identity is Osborne, the first heir of the Augustine family from Rosmandi."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this revelation, the Blood Princess Scarlett Kane raised an eyebrow. "Osborne of the Augustine family? Ha! I didn't provoke them, yet they dared to kill my man? They're asking for trouble!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The subordinate continued, "Your Highness, we just got an invitation from the Augustine family. They're holding an Honor Quest Ceremony for Osborne in half a month."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Scarlett's eyes widened in surprise.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"An Honor Quest Ceremony for him? They must think highly of him! But with his disguise as 'Axell,' taking down Cuthbert and now killing Mose... I guess he does have some skills. It makes sense they'd hold that for him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But how dare he cross me? I won't let him get away with this!"</p><div class="pagination">
