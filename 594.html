  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen waved his hand, and thunderbolts began to flicker above Arena Number One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrifying lightning bolts danced wildly, like countless little snakes, swirling around Owen and protecting him in the center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen reached out and condensed a ball of lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was surprised when he saw this. He had fought Owen before and knew his primary power was Thunder Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, right from the start, Owen had unleashed his ultimate move, an Intermediate Level Thunder Power technique - Thunder Explosion</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, Owen also knew that his opponent was not easy to deal with and wanted to defeat him quickly before he was ready.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen snorted coldly, and the ball of lightning in his hand rushed towards Gordon frantically, reaching him in the blink of an eye and exploding in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon seemed to be genuinely caught off guard, with no defense or dodging movements. The exploding lightning instantly engulfed him, his body torn into countless charred fragments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen was a little surprised when he saw this and then sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godson rank</span><span>s</span><span> tenth in Yalynch</span><span> but</span><span> </span><span>he&rsquo;s only this powerful</span><span>? He can't even take one of my moves. What a </span><span>piece of trash</span><span>, he deserves to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, he stared at the other five Godsons, his confidence swelling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Which of you will die in my hand, then</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The five of them sneered, their eyes filled with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Idiot!" one of the women said without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen's face darkened, and he was about to speak when his expression suddenly changed. He looked towards the spot where Gordon had been standing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon was somehow standing there again, completely unharmed. Even his clothes were perfectly intact as if he had never been attacked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen stared at him in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?! I saw you get hit with my own eyes</span><span>. Y</span><span>ou g</span><span>o</span><span>t torn apart by lightning! How can you be completely fine?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon smiled faintly, "I can resurrect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen's face was filled with disbelief. "Resurrect? How is that</span><span> even</span><span> possible?</span><span>!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Gordon incredulously</span><span>, wondering if he still stood a chance against him</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Idiot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, who was in the dungeon, couldn't help but curse under his breath as he saw Owen's panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was full of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't expect this Gordon to be a light elemental metahuman! So that's how light elemental powers are used, by distorting light?"</span><span> </span><span>Osborne pondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued to watch the battle. He had just obtained the light elemental essence and didn't know how to use it yet. This battle was also a opportunity for him</span><span> to learn more about it</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Useless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma muttered under her breath, feeling even more contempt for Owen. However, she didn't want the Augustine family to lose the bet, so she shouted a reminder to Owen, "His power isn't a recovery; it's light elemental!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's distorting the light, deceiving your vision. The </span><span>person</span><span> you see isn't the real him, and the </span><span>one</span><span> you just blasted wasn't the real him either!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Emma finished speaking, everyone suddenly understood</span><span> what was going on</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen finally </span><span>got the idea of it, too</span><span>, but his face turned even darker, flushing red. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted in defense, "Emma, I don't need your reminder! I figured it out a long time ago. I was just pretending not to notice and trying to mislead him!</span><span> </span><span>Now that you've reminded me, you've ruined my whole plan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's eyes filled with even more disdain upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said coldly, "You better win, or I'll look down on you even more!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen snorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared intently at Gordon, pushing Satan's Eye to its limit. Finally, he could vaguely see that the light on the Arena Number One was distorted and incredibly complex. H</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>e thought Gordon was right in front of him, but he wasn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like looking at a fish in the water through the surface. The light would refract, and the fish wouldn't be in the direction his eyes saw but rather at a particular deviation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the current situation was far more complex than looking at a fish in the water through the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen knew Gordon wasn't there, but he couldn't be sure where exactly he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It caused beads of sweat to appear on Owen's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since I'm not sure of your exact location, I'll cover all possible locations in my attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen didn't want to wait any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached out and grabbed the lightning, quickly condensing five spherical lightning bolts in his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blast him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next second, the spherical lightning bolts shot out, enveloping all the places he thought Gordon might be. The terrifying spherical lightning bolts exploded instantly, lightning flashing wildly, almost covering the entire Arena Number One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter where you're hiding, you're going down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen was delighted with his attack</span><span>. He had</span><span> a sneer on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? The Intermediate Level of Thunder Power is indeed very strong. If it could hit me, I might not be able to block it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon's voice suddenly rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unfortunately, you can't even </span><span>tell</span><span> where I am. Do you think you can hurt me with this kind of wide-range attack?</span><span> </span><span>You're too naive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Gordon finished speaking, a figure suddenly materialized amidst the lightning, his entire body radiating a dazzling light, like a human-shaped sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lightning bolts crashed against him but were deflected by the radiant aura surrounding him, leaving him completely unharmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen's face paled at the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, it's my turn to attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon said with a faint smile. He suddenly pointed his finger, and a terrifying beam of light erupted, so bright that everyone present could barely keep their eyes open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen's scream pierced the air a moment later.</span></p><div class="pagination">
