  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne looked at the injured Emma, feeling a deep sense of heartache.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert's final punch had broken over a dozen of Emma's bones. If she hadn't used a psychic blast to disrupt him, she would've been severely injured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She might have even been killed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking of this, Osborne became furious and said coldly, "Don't worry, I'll get revenge for you! But for now, stop talking. You're hurt. I'll take you for treatment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne held Emma and prepared to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma shook her head, biting her lip. "Osborne, I can't stand Cuthbert. You have to beat him and humiliate him! My injuries aren't serious. I can handle it myself. You don't need to worry about me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't waste your strength healing me. You need to stay in peak condition to deal with Cuthbert."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne hesitated for a moment when he heard this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, he nodded. "Alright! After I'm done with Cuthbert, I'll heal you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's injuries weren't too severe, so Osborne didn't push the issue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He turned his gaze to Cuthbert on the arena.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert, at this moment, was furious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although he had hit Emma, her psychic blast had weakened his strike. Instead of a fatal blow, it only broke a few bones, allowing her to escape the arena.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert couldn't accept this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma had drained a significant amount of his life force and energy, yet she had walked away with only minor injuries?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Furious, Cuthbert noticed Osborne looking at him and let out a cold snort, making a throat-slitting gesture.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Kid, you're her brother, right? I've got her marked. When it's your turn, I'll take all my anger toward her out on you!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Get ready to be tortured!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne snorted coldly in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Torture me? We'll see about that. I just hope you last until it's my turn!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Osborne ignored Cuthbert and carried Emma back to their seats.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart and Maia were both stunned as they looked at Emma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Emma stepped onto the stage, they were incredibly worried and tried to stop her. They thought she was walking into a certain defeat, destined to be humiliated and tormented by Cuthbert as Rhett had been.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But to their shock, Emma had actually made Cuthbert cough up blood!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though Emma had ultimately lost, it was clear to anyone with eyes that Cuthbert had burned through a lot of his energy to defeat her. He was no longer at his peak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Maia, you're amazing!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart and Vivian were both astonished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And they weren't the only ones. Many of the major powers in attendance were now staring at Emma in awe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No one had expected Emma to cause Cuthbert so much trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She's not even on the Godson Rankings?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"With her strength, she could easily be in the top 400, maybe even the top 300 of the Godson Rankings."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Her Death's Stare is a terrifying ability! She drained Cuthbert's life force and energy and even forced him to reveal his Domain!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Cuthbert is in trouble!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert really was in trouble. The amount of energy he'd burned through was more significant than anyone realized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His next opponents would be the Godsons ranked globally, and they were even stronger. He needed to recover quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He needed time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the rules of the Honor Quest Ceremony didn't allow for rest periods. The brutal challenges came one after the other, leaving him no time to recover.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert couldn't help but turn to look at his father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His father was Marvin Williamson, the head of the Williamson family and a Class S Supreme Overlord.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin was frowning as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's appearance had been an unexpected twist. Now that Cuthbert was severely drained, Marvin was more anxious than anyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He shared the same thoughts as his son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They needed to stall for time so Cuthbert could recover.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that in mind, Marvin made a move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stepped onto the stage calmly and said, "Next up, the Godsons on the global rankings, get ready for your challenges! But before that, I want to show everyone something that might motivate you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Marvin clapped his hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd below the stage all looked at Marvin curiously, wondering what he was about to reveal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A moment later, several servants from the Williamson family carried something covered by a red cloth up onto the stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin walked over and smiled lightly. "As per the rules of the Honor Quest Ceremony, anyone who can defeat my son, Cuthbert, will be rewarded with an ancient artifact from the Williamson family and a five trillion dollars prize.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm sure you're all curious about what kind of ancient artifact the Williamson family has prepared, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as he said that, everyone's eyes lit up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Williamson, are you going to reveal the artifact early?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin nodded calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Indeed! The ancient artifact from the Williamson family is no ordinary item. It's a masterpiece. I'll reveal it early to give you all some extra motivation to fight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, he pulled off the red cloth.</p><div class="pagination">
