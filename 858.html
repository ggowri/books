  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Early that morning, Clarissa arrived at the Augustine Estate.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After her defeat by Ebony, she realized just how lacking her combat experience was; facing true experts had exposed her vulnerabilities.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Determined to improve her skills, she rushed to the Augustine Estate, eager to challenge young warriors from around the world in the arena.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Clarissa! Over here!" Yulissa called out, waving from a distance.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A smile instantly lit up Clarissa's face at the sight of Yulissa.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though she now knew Osborne's true identity as the grandson of the Godfather, not part of the Augustine branch bloodline, and Osborne and Yulissa were not siblings, she still felt a warm glow when Yulissa treated her like family.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yulissa!" Clarissa replied, moving closer.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She also greeted Kendra, who stood beside Yulissa.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Kendra."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Both Yulissa and Kendra exclaimed, each linking arms with her, "Wow, Clarissa, you look even more beautiful!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My brother is currently in seclusion preparing for the Honor Quest Ceremony in a few days, so he sent us to welcome you. Let's hurry; the arena is buzzing with excitement!" Yulissa added, her eyes sparkling with enthusiasm.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Those fighters are incredibly strong!" Clarissa nodded, feeling a mix of anticipation and nerves as the three of them made their way toward Challenge Peak.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As they walked, passersby couldn't help but steal glances at the trio of vibrant young women.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before long, they reached Challenge Peak, where three massive arenas had been set up, each filled with fighters.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With just ten days until the Honor Quest Ceremony, many of the top young talents, like those ranked on the Godson Rankings, hadn't yet arrived.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, the matches currently taking place featured mostly Class AAA fighters, with only a handful of Class AA contenders.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A crowd of young warriors gathered around, eagerly waiting for their turn to compete.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they spotted Clarissa and her friends, their eyes lit up with interest, but none dared to approach, unsure of the trio's identities.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa, overwhelmed by the sheer number of skilled fighters, felt both amazed and eager to prove herself.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmph!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A cold snort broke through the excitement.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa turned to see Vincent, Matthew, and Owen approaching. Vincent's eyes narrowed as he caught sight of Kendra and Yulissa, his expression twisting with anger and irritation.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kendra, noticing him, shot back with a scoff.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Vincent, what's with the attitude? Looks like Osborne's lesson didn't sink in deep enough, huh?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent's face darkened at her words, his anger boiling over.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just days ago, he had arranged a fight with Kendra, only for her to vanish before it even started.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Osborne had gone looking for her, they'd clashed, and Vincent had been defeated without landing a single blow.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The humiliation stung, and Kendra's jab only added fuel to the fire.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Kendra, you're just an outsider! How dare you come to the Augustine Estate and act so high and mighty? It was Osborne who beat me, not you! If you've got the guts, let's settle this in the arena!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kendra smirked, unbothered. "Osborne is like my brother, so his victory counts as mine! You want me to step into the ring with you? Please, I'm not wasting my energy on that!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, she turned her back on Vincent, leaving him fuming.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent shot Kendra a furious glare, but then his attention shifted to Clarissa. His eyes widened, captivated by her presence.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who is she?" Vincent murmured, completely mesmerized.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent felt his heart racing as he laid eyes on Clarissa for the first time. Born into the Augustine family, he had seen his fair share of beautiful women, but none compared to her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, he found himself entranced, unable to tear his gaze away.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Clarissa noticed his intense stare, she frowned slightly and fixed him with a cold gaze. "Is there something you need?" Clarissa asked, her tone frosty.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent quickly took a couple of steps forward, forcing a smile. "I'm sorry, beautiful lady. May I ask your name? I'm Vincent, and I..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa interrupted, her voice sharp, "I'm not interested in who you are!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, I'm Osborne's girlfriend, so keep your distance. You're making me uncomfortable!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent was taken aback, his mind racing.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne's girlfriend?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A wave of jealousy twisted his features.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "What's so special about Osborne?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How did he end up with someone like her? Why can't she be with me instead?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His anger flared. "So you're Clarissa from the Radcliffe family? How nice! If it weren't for you helping Osborne during the heir selection, I might've been the first heir of the Augustine family!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That position should have been mine! I've been itching to see just how strong you really are!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Clarissa, I challenge you!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you brave enough to accept?"</p><div class="pagination">
