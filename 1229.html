  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before I take you to find Divine Shadow, I have a few things to take care of. Can you wait for me here for a bit?" Osborne said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila hesitated, a hint of worry creeping into her voice. "Mister, you're not planning to ditch me, are you? I... I can't just stay here alone! I'm strong, really! Even if I'm not at my peak right now, I can still hold my own!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head, trying to reassure her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to meet Divine Shadow, you need to stay put for a little while. Trust me, as long as you haven't lied to me, I won't leave you behind. I'll be back before you know it to take you to her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pinky swear!" Mila extended her pinky, her eyes shining with innocence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne paused for a moment, then linked his pinky with hers, sealing their promise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he took off, moving quickly until he was out of Mila's sight. Once he was sure she couldn't see him, he activated his interdimensional travel and soon found himself near Hearin City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, the battle in Hearin City was nearing its end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deschanel family's thirty-six deities had united their powers, and the Beast Tide was no match for them. The three Dark Deities had been defeated, their massive corpses floating in the air for all to see, a grim spectacle that left the citizens of Hearin City in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere was electric as cheers erupted from the crowd, all chanting the Deschanel family's name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their reputation had skyrocketed to unprecedented heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph stood at the forefront, a smile plastered on his face, but inside, he couldn't help but sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is just the beginning!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the Deschanel family will rule all of Rosmandi! Every force, big or small, will have to bow to us or face annihilation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Let's start with the Augustine family in Newport City."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Joseph basked in the adoration of the crowd, he looked down on them, thinking they weren't even worthy of being cannon fodder, yet Joseph maintained his facade, knowing he had to keep up appearances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a frantic voice echoed in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's been a problem at the sanctuary!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's expression darkened instantly. He could no longer enjoy the cheers and quickly made his way back to the Deschanel Estate, rushing into the sanctuary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, the thirty-six deities and high-ranking members like Damian had gathered, their faces etched with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbeknownst to them, someone was watching from a parallel dimension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Osborne, keen to see how the Deschanel family would react to the theft of the Sanctuary Casket and to confirm whether Mila had been truthful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he was almost convinced by Mila's words, he needed to be absolutely sure before returning her to the Augustine Estate in Newport City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on?" Joseph barked, his face a thundercloud as he glared at the remaining Sanctuary Caskets, his anger palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are our Sanctuary Caskets? Why are they missing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fury silenced everyone around him, leaving them frozen in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Speak!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian stepped forward, trembling. "Reporting, a total of thirty-seven Sanctuary Caskets are missing! I don't know what happened; I just received the report from my subordinates and rushed to tell you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thirty-seven? We only have thirty-six awakened deities, yet we've lost thirty-seven Caskets? Are you telling me that one of us was taken along with their Casket?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's face paled as he quickly scanned the remaining Caskets, dread creeping in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! That little girl has been taken!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression darkened further, a storm brewing within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Joseph Deschanel, what exactly is the identity of that little girl? She's clearly not one of us from the Deschanel Clan. Why should she be allowed to occupy a Sanctuary Casket? There are only 100 of them, and if we reserve one for her, that means one less person from our Deschanel Clan will survive!" someone asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph frowned, shaking his head. "I'm not entirely sure about the specific identity of that little girl, but I do know that she is highly valued by our clan leader. Moreover, she is actually the rightful owner of the Sanctuary Casket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it weren't for our clan leader capturing her and obtaining the Sanctuary Casket from her years ago, our Deschanel Clan would probably have been destroyed. As for why she's allowed to occupy one, that's beyond my knowledge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't expect her to be taken away! Could it be that the person who stole the Sanctuary Caskets was trying to rescue her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then turned his cold gaze towards Damian. "Speak up, what exactly happened?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you understand how precious the Sanctuary Caskets are? Now that 37 of them are missing, how am I going to explain this to our clan leader? We must retrieve the Sanctuary Caskets!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian trembled at Joseph's angry words, his face covered in sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked towards the dozen or so newly awakened members of the Deschanel family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been responsible for guarding the sanctuary, and if anyone knew what had happened, it would be them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Damian loudly asked, "Tell me, what exactly went wrong?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
