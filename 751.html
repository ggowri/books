  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Due to Aleena's interference, Stuart finally stopped hounding Osborne, though the defiant glint in his eyes lingered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone piled into the cars and headed to the airport.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seemed almost deliberate when Aleena decided to share a car with Rhett, leaving Osborne, Emma, Stuart, and Vivian in the other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Inside the car, Stuart was practically shooting daggers at Osborne with his glare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmph!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Axell, when we get to Tethynia, I dare you to go head-to-head with me again. I'm planning to challenge the top young fighters from different nations, and we'll see who comes out on top this time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you brave enough to make a bet? Let's put that energy pistol of yours on the line! If you lose, you hand it over to me!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, what do you say? Are you in?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart's eyes were full of challenge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Osborne didn't even flinch. "Why would I take that bet? And what do you have that's worth betting? My energy pistol is on par with divine artifacts in terms of power, and as for rarity... it's in a league of its own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you want to bet, at least offer up something on the same level, like a divine artifact."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as Osborne said this, Stuart's face darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though he was considered one of the Lambert family's top young talents, he didn't have any divine artifacts. In fact, among the younger generation, only Rhett had been granted one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And even if he did have one, he wouldn't risk it in a gamble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart's face turned beet-red with frustration as he stared at Osborne, secretly envious that he had such a powerful energy pistol.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he knew Osborne didn't just have a super energy pistol but also had the Blood Cross, the Scythe of Goddess of Grain, and the Axe of Strength, he might actually choke on his anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, enough, Stuart. Stop acting like a brat," Vivian suddenly cut in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stuart, I know you've always seen Axell as your rival, but at the end of the day, we're family. Axell and Maia have been gone for over a decade and just got back. Cut him some slack, will you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart opened his mouth as if to argue but thought better of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fine. Welcome back," he muttered coldly, turning his head to stare out the window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled faintly. He realized Stuart wasn't all that bad but just overly competitive, desperate to prove he was better than Axell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Too bad for him, Osborne wasn't the real Axell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The actual Axell was off somewhere, training in seclusion, aiming to break through to Class AAA.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a way, Stuart had already surpassed Axell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But with Osborne playing the role of Axell now, Stuart was in for a tough time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon enough, they arrived at the airport, blending in with the crowd as if they were just regular travelers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a few hours of uneventful flying, they finally touched down in Tethynia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though Tethynia was only about a tenth the size of Rosmandi, its power and influence were nothing to scoff at.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Williamson family, a divine lineage, also served as the royal family of Tethynia. Their residence was a sprawling castle located on the outskirts of the capital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aleena led the group to the Williamson estate, and after presenting their invitation, all six of them were given badges symbolizing their status.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They were then escorted by the Williamson family's attendants to an old but grand villa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The villa was spacious, with over a dozen rooms, more than enough for the seven of them to settle in comfortably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After getting settled, Stuart sought out Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Axell, what do you say we take a little stroll? The Honor Quest Ceremony for Cuthbert is just two days away, and a lot of the world's top young fighters are already here. How about we go find a few to challenge?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart's tone was full of provocation as he eyed Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't tell me you're scared?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You've been out there for over a decade, honing your skills, right? You must've faced some pretty strong opponents. But if you're too chicken to step up, you can just sit back and watch me steal the show!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne sighed internally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the short time he'd spent with Stuart, he realized that Stuart wasn't a bad person at heart. Maybe because of his years of isolated training, he didn't have much experience dealing with people, making his social skills pretty lacking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The guy could hardly hold a normal conversation if his life depended on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne didn't feel like arguing, so he simply stood up and said, "I was actually thinking about checking things out myself. I'm curious to see what these top young fighters from around the world are made of.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Should we ask the others to join us?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart shook his head. "Vivian's already waiting outside. Rhett's been to plenty of these ceremonies, so he's not interested right now. Just grab Maia. The four of us will be enough."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before long, the four of them were on their way to the Williamson family's castle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From a distance, Osborne could see the front of the castle was bustling with activity. At least a hundred people had gathered there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Several large arenas were set up, and young fighters were already locked in intense sparring matches.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even from a distance, Osborne could feel the powerful energy waves rippling from the battles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Most of them are at Class AAA!" he murmured to himself, his expression growing more serious.</p><div class="pagination">
