  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne is dead!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as the announcement came from the Ransford branch bloodline, everyone turned their mocking gazes toward Isaac and his group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isaac and his people were all deathly pale at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Impossible! Osborne can't just die like that. I don't believe it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nathan retorted loudly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, Osborne is so powerful. There's no way he'd die like that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yulissa added, her voice equally loud.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The elder of the Ransford branch bloodline sneered at their words. "So, you're saying that our Ransford branch bloodline's young master, David, is dead? Hah, do you really think that's possible?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"David is a Class AA powerhouse who has mastered dark elemental power. What gives Osborne the right to defeat David?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, you'd better accept reality!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"David must have already obtained the Heir's Emblem. He must be using his dark elemental power to hide, which is why we can't see him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as he finished speaking, everyone nodded in agreement, thinking his reasoning made sense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Owen sneered inwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Finally, Osborne is dead!" he thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Feigning sorry for them, he said, "It's such a pity. I never expected this kind of accident to happen. The death of a branch bloodline heir is a great loss for the Augustine family! But in intense battles, casualties are inevitable. Osborne's death can't be blamed on David, nor on the Ransford branch bloodline."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Owen finished speaking, the elder of the Ransford branch bloodline immediately smiled and thanked him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you for speaking up for us, Mr. Owen Augustine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen smiled, "I'm not speaking for you. I'm just stating the facts. In any case, Osborne is already dead, and no one can be blamed. Your Dampston branch bloodline can't hold anyone responsible for this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Once you return, you should choose a new branch bloodline heir."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His words made Isaac and his group's faces even paler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They clenched their fists tightly, glaring at Owen and the Ransford branch bloodline people in anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, the others just sneered back at them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He lacked strength yet refused to surrender. If he died, he only has himself to blame! How can you guys have the nerve to glare at others? Go back and choose your new heir."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's right, Osborne was too arrogant. First, he challenged Sam, then he challenged Lance. Now he's finally gotten what he deserves! It didn't even take Lance or Sam. David finished him off."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He deserved it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He was too cocky. It's good he's dead!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many people were sneering at this moment, making Isaac and his group feel even worse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They exchanged glances, seeing the sorrow in each other's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isaac was about to lead his people away. After all, with Osborne dead, there was no point in staying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But just then, a commotion arose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The scene suddenly changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A tall figure appeared on the screen. It was none other than Osborne who had defeated David.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Osborne, everyone was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isaac, Nathan, and the others were also shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their previously pale faces instantly filled with excitement and joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's Osborne!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne's not dead! Oh, Osborne is still alive. He's still alive!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nathan shouted with excitement, his face flushed with joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The people from the Ransford branch bloodline turned deathly pale. They couldn't believe their eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne's not dead? How is that possible? Then who could have died?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone turned to look at the Ransford branch bloodline people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The battle between Osborne and David had left nothing but wreckage. If Osborne wasn't dead, then the only one who could be was...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">People began to realize that the person who had died was David!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the crowd realized this, they began to buzz with discussion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Impossible!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The elder of the Ransford branch bloodline shouted angrily, "How can this be? How could the Ransford branch bloodline's heir, David, be killed? This is absolutely impossible!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, the truth is right in front of you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nathan sneered, "Osborne is still alive and well. If David isn't dead, who else could it be? Stop deceiving yourself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You lacked strength and got killed, so you have no one to blame but yourselves!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Nathan finished, the Ransford people became furious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You brat. You're courting death!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The elder of the Ransford branch bloodline unleashed his power, pressing down on Nathan. Nathan, who wasn't even in Class A, couldn't withstand the pressure and immediately spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isaac frowned, and he quickly stood in front of Nathan, unleashing his power to counter the elder's pressure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Isaac was merely an ordinary Class A master, while the elder of the Ransford branch bloodline was in Class AA.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, Isaac's face also turned pale, and blood trickled from the corner of his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You all have to die!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The elder of the Ransford branch bloodline roared. "You people killed our branch bloodline's heir, David. You will all pay the price. I want your lives in return!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isaac gritted his teeth and held his ground, sneering. "Our lives? Didn't you just say that when someone dies, one should accept it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He then turned to Owen and asked, "Mr. Owen Augustine, aren't you going to do something? When everyone thought Osborne was dead, you said that in intense battles, casualties are inevitable, and Osborne's death couldn't be blamed on David or the Ransford branch bloodline.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now that David is dead, should they blame Osborne, or us for that?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After hearing this, Owen's expression turned extremely dark.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He snorted coldly. "This is an internal matter between your branch bloodlines. It has nothing to do with me!"</p><div class="pagination">
