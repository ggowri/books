  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath, watching Seth struggle to sit up in his excitement. "Uncle Seth! Hold on a second! She's not my mother, Vivienne. She's just disguised as her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I brought her out to show you guys to confirm if your Vivienne is the same as my mother. And it looks like she is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he shot Anastasia a glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly reverted to her original appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seth and Tristan stared at her, momentarily lost in disappointment at the revelation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, their excitement reignited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seth locked his gaze on Osborne, his voice brimming with enthusiasm. "So, you really are my little sister's child? My nephew? How old are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a bit awkward. "If we're going by the time on my home planet, I'm nearly fifty!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seth's expression froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Fifty years old? By the time Vivienne left the Hudson family, she hadn't even turned fifty. How could Osborne possibly be her child?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing the confusion, Osborne quickly explained the situation on Blue Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blue Planet! My sister left Celestara for a Dimensional Microcosm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Seth, Blue Planet was just that&mdash;a Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued, "No wonder we've been searching high and low for her without a trace! Turns out she wasn't even in Celestara..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seth began to piece it together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head, frowning. "No! My mother returned to Celestara over twenty years ago! The reason you couldn't find her isn't that she was on Blue Planet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Concern washed over Osborne as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had discovered his mother's family, the absence of news about her was troubling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "She has family here, a renowned family within the Human Community! Why hasn't she returned to the Hudson family? Why is there no word from her at all?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Where could she be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Has something happened to her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's worry was palpable, and Seth's face turned pale as he absorbed the implications.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivienne had only spent a few years on Blue Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after giving birth to Osborne, she and Theodore had fled back to Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of Celestara's timeline, she hadn't been gone long at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, she had been missing for over twenty years!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the Hudson family's relentless efforts, they had found no trace of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a grim realization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seth clenched his jaw. "So, you're Osborne, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what, you are indeed my sister's child! You coming back to the Hudson family is a monumental deal for us! A great blessing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're my sister's child, which makes you my child too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, this is your home!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Seth turned to Tristan. "Tristan, go notify your grandfather right away! Tell him the good news&mdash;my sister's child has returned to the Hudson family! He needs to come here immediately. If he finds out my sister has a child and that he's grown up, he'll be over the moon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan frowned, hesitating. "Dad, Grandpa just went to the Sanctum of Light and hasn't returned yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh?!" Seth's brow furrowed, and he gritted his teeth. "Then inform all your uncles and aunts! Get them all here! My sister's child is back, and they'll be thrilled!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan nodded but hesitated, glancing at Seth's frail form, concern etched on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, your health..." Tristan began, concern etched on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry about me! Just get everyone here. That's what matters most!" Seth insisted, his voice firm despite his frailty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! I'm on it!" Tristan bit his lip, determination setting in as he dashed out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't he just use the terminal wristband to reach out? Why does he have to run around to contact everyone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could dwell on it, a loud, enthusiastic voice rang out from outside the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Tristan, calling out with urgency that echoed across Hudson Valley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone! I need you all here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's super important! Really, really important! Hurry up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice reverberated through the valley, drawing attention from every corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost instantly, powerful figures emerged from various villas, converging around Tristan, their expressions a mix of confusion and concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A middle-aged man, his brow furrowed with worry, asked, "Tristan, what's going on? Is it Seth? Is he... is he alright?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all my fault! As the older brother, I failed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I couldn't save Seth! And now he's had to use the Miracle Elixir on my son! It's all on me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustration and guilt washed over the man as he slapped his own face, anguish evident in his eyes.</span></p><div class="pagination">
