  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Satan's Eye swept across the expanse of the Skeletal Wasteland, searching for any sign of Uriel's exploration team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, he came up empty-handed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although his vision had reached the Sacredness Level, granting him extraordinary clarity, it wasn't enough to pierce through every corner of this vast Umbra Earth landscape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dense thicket of enormous bones obstructed his view, limiting him to seeing only up to 120 miles ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beyond that, everything faded into obscurity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within a radius of 120 miles, there was no sign of Uriel's team, leaving Osborne with no choice but to follow the traces they had left behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he kept an eye out for anything of value in the Skeletal Wasteland, but his hopes were dashed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The place was eerily silent, shrouded in thick fog, and littered with massive bones. Not a single blade of grass dared to grow here, and the ground showed no signs of mineral veins or living Umbra Earth creatures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a desolate wasteland, devoid of life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every skeleton Osborne laid eyes on had long since lost its divine power, corroded by the relentless march of time, rendered utterly useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sense of urgency, he quickened his pace, urging Alfreda to keep up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They moved swiftly&mdash;much faster than Uriel's exploration team, thanks to the freshness of the tracks they were following.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here's a trace from twelve days ago!" Osborne announced, pointing to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten days ago!" he continued, excitement building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eight days ago!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like they've been making about six thousand miles a day. That's not too shabby, considering the dangers of Umbra Earth. Without Satan's Eye, they've got to be extra cautious," he mused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five days ago!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three days ago!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's anticipation grew as he calculated their distance. Based on Uriel's team's speed, they were now only about eighteen thousand miles apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Osborne's interdimensional travel capabilities, he could catch up to them in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait a second!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne's expression shifted as he paused, studying the ground ahead. A frown creased his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is it?" Alfreda asked, glancing at him with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are signs of a struggle here," he replied, his tone serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Signs of a struggle?" Alfreda echoed, her eyes widening in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since entering the Skeletal Wasteland, they hadn't encountered any dangers. It felt like a lifeless realm, devoid of any living creatures. How could there be signs of conflict?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think Uriel's team had a falling out?" Alfreda speculated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head. "It doesn't seem likely! But it's possible they've been wandering through the Skeletal Wasteland for days without finding anything of value.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Frustration can lead to conflict, but Uriel is strong enough to keep his team in line.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This feels more like they encountered an attack.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The attackers were probably humanoid, similar in size and weight to the Human Community or Elf Race!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using his Satan's Eye, Osborne analyzed the traces of the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda frowned. "Humanoid creatures? Forget the details for now; let's catch up to them and get some answers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne </span><span>nodded,</span><span> determination etched on his face. "Stay alert!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the presence of his Satan's Eye reassured him that there were no other creatures nearby, he still felt the need to caution Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they were in Umbra World, where anything could happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a Sacredness Level Satan's Eye like his didn't guarantee they were safe from the unknown dangers lurking in the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The duo forged ahead, their pace slowing slightly as they adopted a more cautious approach. Yet, even so, they moved much faster than Uriel's exploration team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Osborne stumbled upon the second sign of a struggle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he spotted numerous disordered footprints&mdash;definitely not from Uriel's crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But oddly enough, there weren't any bodies around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne deduced swiftly, saying, "The battle must have been inconclusive, and it finished in a hurry! This means the humanoid creatures that attacked Uriel's team are likely very strong&mdash;at least on par with them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda raised an eyebrow, her intrigue mounting. "Could it have been another exploration team?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head firmly. "Out of the hundred teams that entered Umbra Earth, Uriel's group is the strongest. They're leaps and bounds above the others. Any other team would avoid them, not attack.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The assailants are probably intelligent beings from Umbra Earth. It seems their only goal was to... prevent Uriel's team from advancing. And it looks like Uriel wasn't keen on going lethal; they just wanted to push forward.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hence, the absence of any corpses."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His logic made sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne imagined </span><span>that </span><span>a group of Umbra Earth's intelligent beings could be guarding something deep within the Skeletal Wasteland, something Uriel was bent on reaching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Intelligent beings from Umbra Earth?" Alfreda's expression shifted to one of seriousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tightened her grip on her Arcane Staff of Nature, bracing herself for a possible confrontation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, trying to lighten the mood. "Don't be so tense!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no immediate danger around us. Even if there are sentient beings here, they're likely attracted to Uriel's group. We should be safe for now.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm just really curious why Uriel would forego treasures in the Death Chasm and Corrosive Marsh to head straight here. Let's keep moving!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination, Osborne pulled Alfreda along, following the trail left behind. They encountered several more signs of battle along the way, and this time, Osborne finally spotted some blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blue blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike the red blood of the Elf Race or the Human Community, this was distinctly blue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne was convinced that the humanoid attackers truly hailed from the intelligent beings of Umbra World.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're getting closer!" he announced, scanning the horizon with his Satan's Eye, which pierced through countless skeletal remains. Yet, even with the intense focus, he still couldn't locate Uriel's team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he knew that the distance between them had already narrowed significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Strange. According to these tracks, we should be only a few hundred miles from them. So why can't my Satan's Eye pick them up?" he muttered, brow furrowed in concentration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, something caught his gaze&mdash;a colossal skeleton ahead, towering over a thousand yards in height.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This skeleton, while decayed and devoid of divine power, glimmered faintly, almost like crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's the remains of a quasi-Empyrean Sacredness level warrior!" Osborne concluded swiftly, but what really drove a shift in his demeanor wasn't just the skeleton itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the massive entrance to the depths of Umbra Earth that loomed beneath it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The opening was enormous, like a gaping abyss, sloping down into the earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel's team had clearly entered here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could even sense something vibrating energetically from deep within that entrance&mdash;a soft pulse, like a heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone's fighting in the cave!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
