  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne used the Satan's Eye to cautiously sense the energy of the Bronze Mirror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, he was sure that what he felt was right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was indeed a different energy on top of the Bronze Mirror. If Osborne felt it correctly, the energy would belong to the Paltrow family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was hidden perfectly. If Osborne didn't have the Satan's Eye, he would never have found it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why is there a surge of energy from the Paltrow family on top of the Bronze Mirror? And it is hidden. Could it be that the Paltrow family has a conspiracy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne got up instantly after thinking about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't wanted to ask Isa, but now that he had discovered the anomaly, he had to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Paltrow family sent the Bronze Mirror so immediately to the Augustine family, and there might be something wrong with it. It wasn't entirely because the Bronze Mirror wasn't working, and it was likely that there was a conspiracy going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Osborne returned to Isa's mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Isa was guiding Zoe in her cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Osborne had returned, Isa's eyes showed a hint of delight, but she quickly withdrew it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said indifferently, "Why are you back here again? Did you forget something?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "I miss you, so I'm back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa glared at Osborne at once, but she wasn't truly offended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Save your sweet words for your girlfriend, Clarissa. She's your perfect angel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned, and he rubbed his nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, why do I feel that your words sound so upset? What's wrong with you? Are you sick?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon saying that, Osborne touched Isa's forehead with his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's face instantly flushed, and she looked panicked. "Really? I was just kidding!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Isa slapped Osborne's hand away forcibly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me what happened. If nothing's wrong with you, just get out of here. Can't you see I'm guiding Zoe?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe snickered beside them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Osborne while looking at Isa. she always felt that the two were funny, and they would fight with each other every time they got together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne used to lose every time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Isa seemed to have changed lately, but Zoe couldn't say why she had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Bowin, I'm going upstairs to check on Anastasia first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Zoe gave Osborne a wink and ran upstairs to check on Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa complained, "She's being lazy again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She walked over to the sofa and sat down, resting her slender legs on the coffee table and said coldly, "Just tell me what you want from me, and I won't believe your nonsense. Will you miss me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat down across from Isa and waved his hand to take the Bronze Mirror out of the Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, look at this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa looked over and was immediately surprised. "It's a very old ancient magic weapon, but it's been broken. The energy on it has become so weak after hundreds of years, only equal to that of the ancient magic weapon at level three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When it was intact, it was most likely an ancient magic weapon at level five, and it's considered to be one of the most advanced ancient magic weapons."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Isa casually finished speaking, Osborne was instantly impressed with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't even take it for a closer look before she explained the information of this ancient magic weapon, and she knew it even better than Osborne, who had researched it for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, Isa was like an abyss with no bottom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was her power and even her insight far beyond Osborne's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Isa didn't seem to notice the energy from the Paltrow family hidden on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, "Isa, look at this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's there to see?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa said casually, but she glanced at it slightly more seriously, and she was instantly shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? It's been tricked secretly. His tricks are not bad, and I didn't look closely before, so I can't believe I didn't even notice it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Isa sat up straight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took the ancient magic weapon and looked it over carefully when something suddenly occurred to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, what has been done to it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa said calmly, "It's very simple. Someone has put a power on it. As long as that person is willing, he can instantly trigger the ancient magic weapon. At that time, all the energy in the ancient magic weapon will instantly explode. Within 328 feet radius, ordinary Class A Power Masters will be blown up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Simply put, someone made it into an explosive. If you don't find it and take it with you, and it happens to be triggered, you will be seriously injured if not killed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Isa finished speaking, Osborne was instantly shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but feel scared. Sure enough, the Paltrow family had a conspiracy. They didn't give the Bronze Mirror to the Augustine family because they were generous, but they wanted to use the Bronze Mirror to blow up the important figures of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fortunately, I found it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at Isa. "Isa, do you have a solution for it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled lightly, "It's simple."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying that, she stroked the Bronze Mirror with her delicate fingers, and the energy that had belonged to the Paltrow family instantly disappeared without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mouth dropped open in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of trick was this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa was clearly just a martial artist, but Osborne felt that she was even weirder than the ways of the metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, it's already okay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, I've helped you eliminate all the energy on it, so you can use it from now on. It's broken and degraded from level five to level three, but it's still very useful to you now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was instantly surprised when Isa finished speaking.</span></p><div class="pagination">
