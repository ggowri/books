  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Angela and Agatha finally arrived on this resource-bearing planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They asked worriedly, "Osborne, are you okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's the situation now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela and Agatha saw Osborne slaughtering from afar. Feeling his intense killing intent, they thought something had gone wrong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, after destroying the Frenetic Storm Warband, his killing intent had already subsided.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela cautiously asked, "Have you found your parents?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Yes, I found them! Luckily, I wasn't too late!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he descended into the canyon again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela and Agatha immediately followed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Osborne return, Vivienne rushed over, hugged him tightly, and carefully checked his body, fearing he might be injured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt warmth and smiled, "Mom, I'm fine! The people from the Frenetic Storm Warband are no match for me. I've killed them all! From now on, no one can enslave or bully you anymore."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vivienne's body trembled violently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn't help but cry, nodding vigorously. "Alright! This is wonderful! Over the years, your father and I almost couldn't hold on so many times! Thankfully, we made it! Osborne, I'm so proud of you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's tears welled up in his eyes again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the family gathered together, seemingly with endless things to say. Angela and Agatha couldn't get a word in. So, Osborne simply asked them to gather all the slaves on this resource-bearing planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among these slaves, many were not strong. Even if they regained their freedom, they lacked the ability to escape this resource-bearing planet. Therefore, Osborne planned to take them all away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dad, your father is still alive! Mom, your father and brothers are also alive! They are now on Celestara Planet. Now, that place is under my rule."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Next, I will take you to Celestara Planet. From now on, you will stay there and reunite with them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's words filled Theodore and Vivienne with immense joy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright! This is wonderful!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What about you? Will you stay on Celestara Planet with us?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was instantly stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He replied, "Dad, Mom, I will stay on Celestara Planet for a while to spend time with you! But soon, I will leave. I need to go to Racial Convergence Planet because I have very important matters to attend to."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've regained the memories of my past life!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne explained his situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn&rsquo;t hide anything from Vivienne and Theodore, telling them about his plans to participate in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, to pay respects to his mother from his past life, and to avenge her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vivienne and Theodore exchanged a glance, deeply worried about him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, you've grown up now. Your strength is beyond our imagination! But the one you seek revenge against is even stronger! We won't stop you from seeking revenge! After all, to you, who has regained the memories of your past life, she is just as much your mother as I am!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You should avenge her!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But you must remember, only act when you're confident! We're all waiting for you to return safely. If something happens to you, we wouldn't want to live either!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Vivienne tightly held Osborne's hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He nodded firmly. "Alright, I&rsquo;ll listen to you, Mom!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, all the slaves on the resource-bearing planet were gathered by Angela and Agatha, nearly a million in total.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at them, Osborne said, "The Frenetic Storm Warband has been destroyed, and you are all free now! I will send you to the nearest large life-bearing planet, Inferno Planet! The rest is up to you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he began constructing the Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, it was a Level One Two-way Cosmic Translocator. Since their destination was Inferno Planet, which had a Cosmic Translocator, a Two-way Cosmic Translocator would suffice.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In less than a minute, the Cosmic Translocator was completed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela was once again stunned by Osborne's speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn't understand how he could build a Cosmic Translocator so quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On Racial Convergence Planet, building a Cosmic Translocator in a city would take many people working together for several days.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne only took one minute!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If Osborne were a bit stronger, he might be able to build a Cosmic Translocator with just a wave of his hand in the future!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela shook her head helplessly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't have Osborne's talent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't know that building a Cosmic Translocator with a wave of his hand was exactly his goal. That way, he could use it while escaping.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, all the slaves on the resource-bearing planet excitedly boarded the Cosmic Translocator. They looked at Osborne with gratitude, full of hope for the future.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, along with Vivienne and Theodore, also boarded the Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, the Cosmic Translocator was activated. Everyone vanished from the resource-bearing planet and reappeared at a Cosmic Translocator on Inferno Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, all the slaves had left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They would start a new life on Inferno Planet. They were no longer anyone's slaves.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, his parents, Angela, and Agatha returned directly to Racial Convergence Planet through the Cosmic Translocator here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, they stood on Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela murmured, "I'm finally back!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, she accompanied Osborne to rescue his parents. So much happened along the way, and she gained a lot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, she just wanted to return to Fairy Moon Sect, train for a while, and continue improving her strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Angela, Agatha, I'm planning to take my parents back to my birthplace, a small life-bearing planet! I'll stay with them for a while there! So, let's part ways here! I'll return to Racial Convergence Planet before the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel begins!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was preparing to say goodbye to Angela and Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela nodded. "Alright! We'll get in touch when you return!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Agatha didn&rsquo;t leave. She said, &ldquo;Osborne, I don&rsquo;t have a place to stay on Racial Convergence Planet anymore. I want to follow you! Besides, I&rsquo;ve gained so much recently. I want to find a quiet place to train for a while. So..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Can I go back with you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, she looked at Osborne expectantly, a bit worried he might refuse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hesitated immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Vivienne took Agatha's hand and said with a smile, "Of course you can! I'll agree on Osborne's behalf. Come back with us!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing that Vivienne had agreed, Osborne naturally wouldn't object anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright! Then let's set off!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There is no direct Cosmic Translocator connection between Racial Convergence Planet and Celestara Planet, so they need to be transported to Necoton Planet first, and then traverse the stars to reach Celestara Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, Osborne came to Racial Convergence Planet from Celestara Planet in the same way.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, he has learned to build a Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, after they arrived at Necoton Planet, Osborne found a remote and safe spot to build a one-way Cosmic Translocator. Soon, they were transported near Celestara Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, they landed on Celestara Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne felt that Vivienne and Theodore were a bit nervous and excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was also a bit excited because it had been a while since he last saw Sebastian and Jethro.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I hope they're doing well!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
