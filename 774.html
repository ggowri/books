  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne frowned when he heard this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His fight with Emi had drained him. Most importantly, his Spatial Domain had been shattered by her, causing a backlash to his mental energy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He needed to rest before he could use his Spatial Domain again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, someone else wanted to challenge him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Could they really use this kind of endless challenge format? If so, wouldn't he be guaranteed to lose?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne looked questioningly at Jackie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jackie stepped onto the platform and said calmly, "Osborne, since you beat Emi, you can rest for half an hour before facing the next challenger. Or, if you feel ready, you can continue right away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne nodded in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll take the half-hour break."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Osborne walked off the platform.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man who had challenged him snorted coldly. "Axell, I'll wait for you to rest! In half an hour, I'll be back to challenge you again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, he sat back down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne ignored him and returned to his seat, closing his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd looked at him in astonishment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No one had expected Osborne to be able to defeat Emi using pure strength alone after losing his Spatial Domain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was only Class AA!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This guy's body is like a monster! To beat him, you must destroy his Spatial Domain and withstand his raw power!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If he breaks through to Class AAA, how strong will he become? He could surpass all of us, maybe even break into the top 400!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's already 35 and still only Class AA. It might not be easy for him to break through to Class AAA.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We definitely can't underestimate him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd murmured, but Osborne paid them no mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though the fight with Emi had been tough, it had greatly improved him, helping him recognize his weaknesses in intense combat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was now reflecting on what he had gained from the battle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My Spatial Domain is still too weak, not stable enough! Emi's decision to self-destruct her Dark Domain easily shattered mine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If my Spatial Domain were strong enough, it wouldn't have been shattered. I wouldn't have needed to use so much strength to defeat Emi.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I need to make my Spatial Domain more stable!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne pondered ways to reinforce his Spatial Domain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, another fight had started on the platform.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne didn't pay attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He suddenly remembered another domain he controlled, the Light Domain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the battle with Emi, he would have won easily if he had used his Light Domain instead of the Spatial Domain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne felt that his Light Domain was far stronger than Emi's Dark Domain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if Emi had self-destructed her Dark Domain, it wouldn't have shattered his Light Domain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why is my Light Domain so stable?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can I draw inspiration from my Light Domain to improve my Spatial Domain?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's eyes lit up. He felt it was worth trying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Osborne realized that his intuition had improved. In the past, he wouldn't have thought of a solution so quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Unfortunately, this isn't the place to reveal my Light Domain. It's my trump card, and I can't expose it easily. I'll wait until I get back to work on it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After coming to this conclusion, Osborne finally opened his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He turned his attention to the fight happening on the platform.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two fighters on the platform were both powerful, locked in an intense battle. Both had control over domains, but from the start, their domains had clashed and shattered each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They used all their techniques, and finally, one emerged victorious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And then, the next battle began.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, the half-hour passed, and Osborne was fully recovered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Axell, come and fight!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man who had previously challenged Osborne stepped onto the platform, and Osborne glanced at the badge on his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From Ransford, Takashi Kihara!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ranked 472nd on the Godson Rankings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Another one from Ransford?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne frowned, snorted coldly, and stepped onto the platform without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Takashi glared at him coldly. "Axell! So, you managed to defeat Emi, not bad! But in the end, you'll still fall to me! I will...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Cut the crap. Let's fight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne waved him off and immediately unleashed his Spatial Domain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Spatial Collapse!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as Takashi was caught in Osborne's Spatial Domain, the attack began.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Takashi's face darkened as he glared at Osborne in anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He quickly escaped the range of the Spatial Collapse and shouted furiously, "Axell, you have no honor! You attacked me before I finished speaking!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he spoke, he swiftly activated his Dark Domain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He self-destructed again, just like Emi had.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Takashi chose the same tactic as Emi Byrd. He used self-destructing his Dark Domain, causing both his and Osborne's domains to collapse.</p><div class="pagination">
