  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Justina's face turned grim. She stared coldly at Mason.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mason wondered, "What does Osborne mean? What does this have to do with Quinn? Why has Justina's look at me changed?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mason didn&rsquo;t have time to think much and stared at the Kingdom Duel Badge on Osborne&rsquo;s chest. When he saw that the badge had over 37 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, he was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was over 37 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mason glanced down at his Kingdom Duel Badge. His Kingdom Duel Scorepoints were also quite high, reaching 840 million, slightly more than Brenda's, but compared to Osborne's Kingdom Duel Scorepoints...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He now had the urge to put away his Kingdom Duel Badge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The gap was too huge!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How is this possible? Wasn't your Kingdom Duel Badge and Kingdom Duel Scorepoints already taken by Lionel? Many people have confirmed it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mason's face was pale at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone else was equally shocked. Rumors had it that Osborne's Kingdom Duel Badge was stolen, and Osborne had been killed. Yet, not only was Osborne still alive, but his Kingdom Duel Badge was also intact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was curious about how he managed to escape so many warriors chasing him and still keep his Kingdom Duel Badge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone looked at Osborne with envy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Earlier, they had gloated over Osborne losing his Kingdom Duel Scorepoints and mocked him. But now, they only felt ashamed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had over 37 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, more than all of them combined!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they had that many Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, they might be willing to be mocked too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone looked at Osborne, speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only a small number of people noticed something was off with Justina.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Justina stared at Mason, her expression grim, and said coldly, "How dare you deceive me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mason felt a chill all over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Justina is an advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior, very powerful and highly respected. She exuded a strong aura, putting immense pressure on Mason.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly said, "Ms. Porter, I didn't mean to deceive you. Everyone said Osborne's Kingdom Duel Badge was lost. I thought he didn't..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is that so?" Justina said coldly, "You slander others and waste my time. I think you deliberately want to sabotage the Glorious Sacrificial Ceremony and the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Arrest Mason!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I now suspect he's a spy sent by an enemy nation! Verify his identity and then take him to the Royal Sepulcher!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two strong men appeared behind Justina and seized Mason.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mason said anxiously, "Ms. Porter, I am innocent! There's no issue with my identity. I am Mason, ranked tenth on the leaderboard! Most people here can vouch for me. My Kingdom Duel Badge also has my information."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And I'm under Prince Quinn's command..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne heard Mason's words, couldn't help but laugh, and looked at Mason with pity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Mason had pledged allegiance to Quinn, he clearly knew nothing about the situation of the Glorious Divine Kingdom's Royal Family. Yet he still willingly admitted to being under Quinn's command.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In The Palace, everyone knows that Quinn and Weston are the biggest rivals. They compete for power and the qualification to become the next Glorious Divine Emperor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quinn and Weston have a confrontational relationship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If the Glorious Divine Emperor were not still alive, Quinn and Weston would have already fought over the succession.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Justina personally raised Weston and loves him deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne deliberately told her that Mason had sided with Quinn, just to get Justina to punish Mason. But Mason didn&rsquo;t catch on and even admitted he was Quinn&rsquo;s subordinate, hoping Justina would spare him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He's asking for trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at Mason with pity. Knowing Justina, she might not dare to kill Mason outright, but she would definitely torture him severely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whether it's Weston's subordinates or Quinn's subordinates, they are all Osborne's enemies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Take him away!" Justina waved her hand, completely ignoring Mason's cries.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Mason was taken away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone watched in fear. Mason was personally recruited by Quinn and was the strongest among them, but Justina showed no mercy to Mason.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>None of them knew about the Royal Family's situation; they all thought Justina was punishing Mason to help Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone looked at Osborne differently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Justina turned to Osborne and coldly said, "Your name is Osborne?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded, calmly meeting Justina's gaze, striving to control his anger to avoid letting Justina sense it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, Justina didn&rsquo;t notice anything unusual.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She simply said coldly, "Your name makes me uncomfortable, reminds me of a despicable old acquaintance! But I know you're not him. That despicable guy is probably long dead!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But you deliberately told me Mason sided with Quinn, which makes me curious. You seem to know a lot about the Royal Family's situation?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was surprised, realizing he had been careless just now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Justina didn&rsquo;t doubt his identity but found it very unusual that Osborne knew about Weston and Quinn&rsquo;s poor relationship, especially since they always appeared to get along well in front of others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne calmly said, "I just happened to hear some rumors, so I gave it a try."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Really? I hope so." Justina stared at Osborne for a long time, seeing his calm demeanor, and eventually had to give up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She waved her hand and said, "Everyone, follow me. We're entering the Royal Sepulcher now! Once inside, you must wait in the corner and absolutely must not wander around."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you anger the big shots or disrupt the Glorious Sacrificial Ceremony, no matter where you're from or what background you have, you'll be punished!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Justina turned and walked out quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others quickly followed, their expressions serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, Clara, and Leroy followed behind, swiftly passing through streets guarded by numerous soldiers, approaching the Palace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Royal Sepulcher of the Glorious Divine Kingdom is behind the Palace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It is a towering peak. It is said that Solomon, one of the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet and the founder of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, was born on that mountain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When he was born, lightning flashed around the peak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This mountain eventually became the sacred site for the Glorious Divine Kingdom Royal Family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Royal Sepulcher is at the foot of the mountain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They bypassed the massive Palace and gradually approached the Royal Sepulcher.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's breathing became rapid.</span></p><div class="pagination">
