  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for the compliment, Mr. Wilkens. I'll do my best," Osborne replied calmly before stepping off the arena, ready to make way for the next match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had Vadim not provoked him, Osborne likely would have just defeated him without inflicting such severe injuries. After all, with Vadim's skill, he could still have competed for second place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Second place came with rewards too, not just from the sect but also ninety Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each point could at least be exchanged for a Sacred Crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't sound like much at first glance, but the real prize was the chance to continue in the city duel. Given Vadim's abilities, he had a solid shot at breaking into the top ten, which could net him thousands of Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>&mdash;a fortune by any measure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, however, with Vadim severely injured, he had lost his chance at the top ten and wouldn't be able to participate in the upcoming city duel at Tempest Fortress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The losses were substantial. Osborne knew that once Vadim woke up, he would undoubtedly harbor hatred towards Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given Vadim's standing, he would likely make things difficult for Osborne within the Mystic Sirius Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne couldn't have cared less.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His sole reason for joining the Mystic Sirius Sect was to secure a legitimate identity. Once the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel was over, he'd likely move on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, Vadim wouldn't stand a chance of getting revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne had no qualms about what he'd done to Vadim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lived by a straightforward code&mdash;he didn't go looking for trouble, but he wasn't one to back down from it either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next up for the second match, a contestant from Peak Six..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tournament rolled on. Osborne watched for a while, but his interest quickly waned. The fighters were no match for Vadim; they were at least a couple of skill levels below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was nothing he could glean from their battles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of wasting his time, he'd rather head back and train to beef up his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sadly, Osborne had at least five or six more matches to sit through today. He couldn't just leave, so he shut his eyes and slipped into a quiet meditation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, it was time for Osborne's second match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, his opponent was a core disciple from Peak Four. Osborne didn't mess around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he set foot on the stage, he whipped out his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow and channeled his Sacred Power into an arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disciple from Peak Four tried to put up a fight, but he didn't stand a chance against even one of Osborne's arrows. He pushed himself to the max, but he couldn't break through the might of Osborne's Sacred-Power-infused arrow. His defenses crumbled like a house of cards, and there was no way for him to dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, a single arrow laid him low.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this time, Osborne reined in his power. Osborne made sure he only defeated his opponent, leaving him with just a minor scratch that wouldn't stop him from fighting in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disciple stood up, his expression a mix of respect and confusion as he looked at Osborne. Finally, he bowed slightly. "Thank you for the lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback. This was a core disciple, and he was just an inner disciple; normally, respect should flow the other way. But clearly, he had earned the respect of everyone through his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded and stepped off the stage without further comment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throughout the day, Osborne faced no significant challenges. Even in his third match, he took down his opponent with another arrow. From his fourth match onward, every opponent chose to surrender immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all realized Osborne's strength far surpassed theirs by at least two levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't even withstand one of his arrows, and with no hope of victory, why waste their energy? Facing the risk of injury just to fight Osborne seemed pointless when they could save their strength for other matches, where they might still have a chance to break into the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the first day of battles drew to a close, Osborne boasted an outstanding record of seven straight wins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right behind him, Jamar and Bethan also remained undefeated, each with six wins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their flawless win rates put them in a temporary three-way tie for first place. It was a safe bet that the eventual champion would come from this elite trio.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was plain as day to everyone that Osborne took out his opponents at a far quicker clip than Jamar and Bethan. Both Jamar and Bethan were forces to be reckoned with, but they often had a hard time scoring a one-shot victory. Sometimes, it took them ages to come out on top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the day's battles finally wrapped up, the crowd was abuzz with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tomorrow, Osborne is bound to go head-to-head with Jamar and Bethan! That's when we'll find out who's truly worthy of the champion title!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I reckon it'll be Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, he's only at the Ascension Eight level, but he's already got a handle on Sacred Power! Unless Jamar and Bethan have some aces up their sleeves, they don't stand a chance against him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne's archery is just mind-blowingly cool and terrifying! So far, only Vadim has managed to take one of his arrows and live to tell the tale! Man, I wish I could be that badass!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the crowd argued and whooped with excitement, they eventually made their way off to catch some rest. The tournament was set to resume bright and early the next day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the moment arrived. Osborne was up against Jamar!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the arena floor, Osborne tightened his grip on his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow. His expression was as calm as a still lake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In sharp contrast, Jamar looked dead serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you're the man!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, take down Jamar! You're </span><span>gonna</span><span> be the champion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd below erupted in cheers for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His skills and remarkable record had won over many disciples of the Mystic Sirius Sect, and they were whole-heartedly rooting for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Jamar wasn't short on fans either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jamar! Don't let him steal the win! He's only at Ascension Eight! Even if he's mastered Sacred Power, I know you can crush him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, Jamar!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jamar..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the crowd's cheers didn't faze the two fighters in the arena one bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave Jamar a little wave, the gesture oozing with a teasing challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see what you've got up your sleeve!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar let out a scoff, his voice dead serious. "Osborne, you're something else! At Ascension Eight and already having mastered Sacred Power. Even Vadim couldn't stand up to you&mdash;two arrows and he was out of the game! But taking me down won't be a walk in the park!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had a secret weapon in store for Vadim, but looks like I'll have to unleash it on you instead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'd better watch your back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne arched an eyebrow, a confident smirk dancing on his lips. "A secret weapon, eh? Bring it on! I can't wait to see just how powerful it is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar took a deep breath, his expression growing even more steely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Jamar charged forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar was well aware of Osborne's deadly archery skills; if he gave Osborne the freedom to shoot at will, he'd end up like Vadim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he decided to go for close-range combat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, a bow was a long-range weapon, and its effectiveness would take a nosedive in close-quarters battles. This was his shot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a split second, Jamar closed the gap and launched a ferocious attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thunderstrike! Smash through him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar hefted a pair of huge iron hammers, quasi-Sacred Artifacts that practically crackled with raw might. As he swung them, tendrils of lightning snaked across their surfaces, making the ground beneath tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne arched an eyebrow, a knowing smile appearing on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Close-range combat? You </span><span>wanna</span><span> go toe-to-toe with me in a test of strength? That's an interesting thought, but it's a bit of a pipe dream!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won't come out on top in a strength showdown!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne balled his right fist, coating it in the searing energy of Sacred Power, and let loose a bone-crushing punch.</span></p><div class="pagination">
