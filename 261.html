Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Various weapons struck Osborne, but he remained unmoved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake's face twisted with a snarl, full of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "What a piece of crap! Mr. Ashford said he was quite capable and told me to be cautious? What a joke&mdash;he cannot even dodge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serves him right to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon Blake realized something was wrong. The black knife he wielded struck Osborne's chest with no sensation of penetrating flesh; it felt as if he had struck a solid steel plate, and the recoil left his hand numb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Osborne in shock and saw that Osborne's body was covered in a faint, </span><span>bluish glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This glow deflected all their attacks, none of which could touch Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even his suit remained unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear flashed in his eyes as he stammered, "You... you are a metahuman?! Damn it, such an important piece of information, and he did not tell me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fierce look in Blake's eyes quickly faded, replaced by terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Metahumans, the true rulers of this world!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the second leader of the Scarlet Gang, </span><span>Mayby</span><span> City's largest gang, I knew a lot that ordinary people did not. I knew that the ancient families and power forces controlling the world were led by metahumans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Metahumans could defy gravity and be impervious to weapons!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ancient families controlled the world's economy, thus controlling the elite families, who in turn funded the criminal gangs..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sweat drenched Blake's body as he thought about this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled contemptuously and said, "Realizing this only now is a bit late! You have provoked me, so you might as well report to hell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne reached out and took the black knife from Blake's hand. With a slight squeeze, he twisted the tough alloy steel knife into a helix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake was stunned, his face turning pale. He looked at the murderous intent in Osborne's eyes and felt an icy chill all over his body. Blake fell to his knees with a thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am sorry, I was wrong! I realize my mistake!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please do not kill me! I was paid to do a job.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will tell you everything if you spare me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne demonstrated his terrifying powers as a metahuman, Blake quickly surrendered, crying and pleading for his life, begging Osborne not to kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His subordinates were equally terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing their boss kneeling, they dropped their weapons and knelt in front of Osborne, begging for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked and coldly said to Blake, "Oh, someone asked you to frame me? Then tell me, who gave you these orders? Do not even think about lying&mdash;I will find out the truth. If you deceive me, I will make sure you die a miserable death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will tell </span><span>you,</span><span> I will tell you everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake was already terrified, so he dared not withhold anything. "It was Wesley Ashford from the Ashford family who ordered me! He wanted me to set up this trap to ruin you and make you a joke of the entire </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is also the backer of the Scarlet Gang. It is thanks to the Ashford family's support that the Scarlet Gang could expand and monopolize the adult entertainment business in </span><span>Mayby</span><span> City. By the way, forcing homeless women and even kidnapping respectable women to control their bodies and make them sell themselves for profit was also Wesley's idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am just Wesley's puppet. Whatever he tells me to do, I do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It really has nothing to do with me. Please do not kill me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake revealed everything quickly, fearing that any delay might result in Osborne killing him on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body was no match for the alloy steel knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was surprised to learn about the deep connection between the Ashford family and the Scarlet Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes flashed with cold murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "I was not a good person, but I deeply hated those who forced women into prostitution. I had no power to change things before, but now that I had the means, I could not just ignore it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the Ashford family and the Scarlet Gang were engaged in such cruel business, they did not deserve to exist!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was about to kill Blake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, hurried footsteps approached. A large group of people, having heard the commotion from the second floor, rushed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading them was Wesley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley's face turned grim when he saw Osborne standing on Blake's head. He glared at Blake angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You cannot even handle this small task? You are useless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he turned to Osborne and shouted, "Osborne, what do you think you are doing? Today is my wedding, and these are my guests. How dare you lay hands on my guests? Do you have any respect for me or the Ashford family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley's roar was followed by his bodyguards surrounding Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake saw this and felt like he had found a savior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately shouted, "Mr. Ashford, help me! This man is despicable! Not only did he assault Ava and try to rape her, but when I discovered it, he also attacked us and tried to kill us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Ashford, quickly capture him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is crazy!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
