  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo's face darkened instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a Deity King warrior, he was at the pinnacle of the pyramid in Celestara. Whoever dared to steal his Miracle Elixirs, he was confident he could exact his revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, the one who stole his Miracle Elixirs was a genius from the Paramount Supreme Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Paramount Supreme Clan&mdash;descendants and relatives of Lord Malevolence&mdash;held the highest status in Celestara, representing the will and might of Lord Malevolence himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even as a Deity King, Angelo dared not tangle with a genius from the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he knew they had stolen his Miracle Elixirs, he couldn't afford to retaliate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This left Angelo seething with frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you absolutely sure it's the Supreme Malevolence Sword's mark?" Angelo asked, his voice tinged with reluctance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edison nodded vigorously, his expression just as grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm certain, Mr. Angelo Royston! The air around here still carries the scent of the Supreme Malevolence Sword. Could it be that a genius from the Paramount Supreme Clan came to Divine Peak Nine for training? And they just happened to discover Celestial Sword Peak and the Miracle Elixirs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo's face hardened, and he finally nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's very likely. The geniuses from the Paramount Supreme Clan are incredibly confident; they would indeed come to divine peaks for training. Moreover, they're not Deity Kings, yet they managed to easily suppress you without killing you. It must be a genius from the Paramount Supreme Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sighed, his voice heavy with resignation, "Forget it. If the Miracle Elixirs were taken by a genius from the Paramount Supreme Clan, we should just drop it. No more investigation. We don't want to upset them and start a bigger problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope these geniuses remember our effort. After all, if it weren't for us drawing the Deathborn's attacks, they wouldn't have had such an easy time taking the Miracle Elixirs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edison nodded, feeling the weight of their loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had suffered greatly this time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deathborn forces on the platform numbered over five thousand, including forty or fifty at the peak Deity Overlord realm. Though Angelo had obliterated all the Deathborn, their group had taken significant casualties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they were down to less than a hundred, with only about ninety left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Worst of all, they had gained nothing, all their efforts wasted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one would be happy with this outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go! We've been fighting here, and the Deathborn nests in the vicinity have probably already been alerted. If we don't leave soon, we'll be cornered on Celestial Sword Peak by a Deathborn horde," Angelo said, waving his hand and leading the group away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unknown to Angelo, the one who had stolen the three Miracle Elixirs was not a genius from the Paramount Supreme Clan, but Osborne himself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had used the Supreme Malevolence Sword and refrained from having his clones kill Edison and his group precisely to mislead Angelo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, Osborne's plan had worked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, Osborne and Diana had already fled Celestial Sword Peak at breakneck speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finding a safe spot, Osborne stopped and contacted Riley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon learning that his plan had successfully misled Angelo, he breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Big catch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three Miracle Elixirs were now nestled safely in his Dimensional Space. This was a massive windfall&mdash;anyone who obtained three Miracle Elixirs would see a significant boost in their power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only downside for Osborne was that he couldn't completely extract the Elixirs from the humanoid stone without damaging it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their roots were deeply embedded in the stone, and if he wanted to remove them along with the stone to retain their full potency, he would have to destroy the stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne didn't want to do that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt that the humanoid stone was far from ordinary!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he didn't yet understand its purpose, he had a hunch that its value might surpass that of the Miracle Elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Destroying the stone just to get the Elixirs seemed like too high a price for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it really can't be helped, I'll have to give up on the roots of the Miracle Elixirs. It'll weaken their effects by at least half, but there's no other choice," Osborne thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then released the humanoid stone from his Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stone stood about 164 feet tall, resembling a person sitting cross-legged in meditation but devoid of any facial features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What in the world is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne ran his hands over the stone, feeling its texture and the faint glow it emitted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sensed a strange energy pulsing within the stone, the same energy that rendered his spatial power completely ineffective.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even near the humanoid stone, he couldn't access the parallel space for interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana watched curiously, her eyes narrowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I keep getting the feeling that this humanoid stone looks like someone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?" Osborne was surprised. "Like who?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana furrowed her brow, deep in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, her body suddenly trembled, and her face turned deathly pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't remember! Just thinking about it gives me a headache!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
