  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Godfather&rsquo;s medical research lab could cure Anastasia&rsquo;s illness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne trembled with excitement. He was thrilled at the possibility of extending Anastasia&rsquo;s life for a year, and even more so at the better news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But he soon calmed down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He needed six-star access to send Anastasia to the restricted area of Godfather&rsquo;s medical lab.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Right now, he only had one star.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With each heir trial he completed, he could gain one star. That meant he had to complete five more dangerous heir trials within a year.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It seemed too difficult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, as long as there was a chance to save Anastasia, no matter how hard or dangerous, he was ready to do whatever it took.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was eager to start the second challenge of inheritance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But first, he needed to buy the longevity herb to extend Anastasia&rsquo;s life by a year.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Otherwise, she would die in seven days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Where can I buy the longevity herb?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Isa thought for a moment and said, &ldquo;This kind of top-tier medicinal herb, costing millions or even tens of millions of dollars, usually appears only at top-tier auctions. Fortunately, there&rsquo;s one tomorrow afternoon at Mayby City hosted by the Draco Group. You can check it out since your Draco Star Wristlet grants you access without an invitation.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;The Draco Auction?&rdquo; Osborne&rsquo;s eyes sparkled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne stayed by Anastasia&rsquo;s bed that night while studying The Breath of Celestial.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He found The Breath of Celestial not as difficult as Isa had mentioned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In just one night, he had mastered the basics. His breathing became deep and powerful, each breath opening his pores to expel a foul-smelling black mud.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, he felt incredibly light, as if he had been working out in a gym for days. His strength, speed, and reaction time all improved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;The Breath of Celestial seems quite miraculous. If I keep training like this, my physical condition will soon surpass human limits, and I&rsquo;ll become as powerful as a beast.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Unbeknownst to him, others would be astounded if they knew of his rapid progress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The elite Glacium breathing technique, which many failed to master over years or even decades, was mastered by Osborne in just one night, a feat unheard of.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Immersed in enhancing his physical condition through The Breath of Celestial, Osborne continued until the next afternoon. After taking a shower, he prepared to attend the auction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Please take care of my sister.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After asking Isa to look after Anastasia, Osborne hailed a taxi and headed to the Draco Auction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, at the Caldwell Manor, Ophelia said, &ldquo;Evelyn, I&rsquo;m heading out.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; Evelyn asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve arranged to meet Wesley at the Draco Auction. A set of rare jewels is being auctioned off, worth over ten million dollars. I want to see them,&rdquo; Ophelia replied nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had never owned such priceless jewels before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But now, as the heir to the Caldwell family and soon to be Wesley&rsquo;s wife, she needed such treasures to complement her status.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Are you talking about the Ocean Whisper Sapphire?&rdquo; Evelyn asked with a serious expression. &ldquo;I heard that Ms. Radcliffe is also interested in the Ocean Whisper Sapphire.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ms. Radcliffe?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia was startled, her eyes filled with a mix of awe and envy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They were referring to Clarissa Radcliffe, known as the most beautiful woman in Mayby City, who was said to be stunningly gorgeous. The Radcliffe family, to which she belonged, was ancient, far surpassing a wealthy family like the Caldwell family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In terms of status, beauty, and talent, Ophelia couldn&rsquo;t compare to Clarissa, and even the thought of meeting her was difficult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;No matter what, I&rsquo;ll go to the auction first. Maybe I&rsquo;ll get a chance to meet Ms. Radcliffe. If I can become friends with her, it could catapult the Caldwell family to new heights,&rdquo; Ophelia excitedly planned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evelyn seemed intrigued. &ldquo;Wait a minute. I&rsquo;ll change my clothes and come with you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon after, the Draco Auction venue was bustling with activity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The elite of Mayby City seemed to have all showed up there, with one high-profile figure after another arriving in luxury cars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne, arriving in a taxi, stood out conspicuously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As he got out of the taxi, he attracted many curious stares.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone wanted to know who would dare to arrive at such a high-end event in a taxi.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Their looks were filled with disdain and mockery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, Osborne was unfazed. His only goal was the longevity herb.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But as he approached the entrance of the auction house, a cold and angry voice suddenly sounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Osborne, you worthless fool, what are you doing here? Do you still want to pester Ophelia?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Turning around, Osborne saw Evelyn and Ophelia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Both were dressed to the nines, looking like a pair of stunning sisters, accompanied by a group of Caldwell family members and bodyguards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne even spotted Justin and Penelope among them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that moment, they all looked at Osborne with anger as if they wanted to kill him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Osborne, you jerk, didn&rsquo;t you hear me? Why are you here?&rdquo; Evelyn repeated angrily.</p><div class="pagination">
