  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace was banged up pretty bad in the fight with Agatha, but his healing powers were something else. Now, he was almost back in tip-top shape. When he caught wind of Osborne and the others approaching, he cracked open his eyes, a cold, steely glint flashing in them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his eyes zeroed in on Broderick and Benson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sneer on his face, he jeered, "Well, well, Broderick and Benson. You two have joined forces, huh? Figuring that since I got the better of me by Agatha, you've got a shot at taking me down? If that's the game plan, then come at me together! Even after that loss to Agatha, I'm still the top dog in this state duel, second to none. You two don't stand a snowball's chance in hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace oozed confidence as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Broderick and Benson exchanged a quick look. Then Broderick shot back coolly, "Horace, you're full of hot air! Even if we're not in your league, we're not that desperate to team up against you. And besides, we're not the ones here for a scrap with you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's him&mdash;Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace's jaw dropped. "Not you two, but him? Some guy ranked over a hundred, just got lucky and racked up some points? He thinks he can throw down with me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's coming to challenge me? Absurd!" Horace's face clouded over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Broderick kept his voice steady. "Horace, you haven't bothered to check the rankings lately, right? You'd better take a gander before you make a fool of yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace furrowed his brow but quickly peeked at the rankings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second he took in the numbers, his eyes popped wide in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He whipped his head back to Broderick and Benson. "Your scores have each tanked by hundreds of thousands, while his has shot up to 9.3 million! So you both got your butts kicked by him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Broderick and Benson nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bet! We've both been beaten. Now it's your turn! Once we get rid of you, he'll go after Agatha for the championship!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace's face contorted with rage. "What a load of bull! There's no way he can beat me! Even if he took you down, he's no match for me. The only one who's got a shot at challenging Agatha for the title is me&mdash;Horace! No one else!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Horace sprang to his feet, his expression icy as he stared daggers at Osborne. "As long as I'm around, you don't have the right to challenge Agatha. I'll wipe the floor with you in a heartbeat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile. "Is that so? Then let's quit wasting time. Let's rumble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, he drew his Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace's face turned as gloomy as a thundercloud. He readied his defensive Sacred Artifact, clutching the Frost-invoking Canvas tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sight of the Frost-invoking Canvas, both Benson and Broderick flinched, a glimmer of fear in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara and Leroy wore grim expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, watch out for his Frost-invoking Canvas! It's no ordinary Sacred Artifact..." Clara cautioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "The power of a Sacred Artifact boils down to the person using it. No matter how badass an artifact is, it's nothing in the hands of an amateur."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne meant his words to calm Clara down, but Horace took them as a direct slap in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought Osborne was dissing his skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His temper flared up, and his gaze turned even frostier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're so green! You have no clue how powerful the Frost-invoking Canvas is when I wield it! In this whole state duel, apart from Agatha, no one can take a hit from it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you definitely can't!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, let me show you just how much damage the Frost-invoking Canvas can do!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Horace launched his assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He whipped the Frost-invoking Canvas around, unleashing a tidal wave of icy energy that came crashing down. Everyone nearby&mdash;even Broderick and Benson&mdash;couldn't help but shudder. They felt an intense cold that seemed like it could freeze their blood solid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And they weren't even in the line of fire; they were just caught in the blast's aftermath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn, that Frost-invoking Canvas is a beast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With that thing in his hands, Horace is no pushover! I just can't wrap my head around how Agatha managed to hold her own against that bone-chilling power. And Osborne... can he really take this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Broderick and Benson, who had been so sure of Osborne before, started to have second thoughts. The full might of Horace's Frost-invoking Canvas was hitting them hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Freeze!" Horace barked when he saw that Osborne'd given him the chance to let loose with his artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sneering smile crossed Horace's face. He couldn't believe Osborne could stand up to the Frost-invoking Canvas' onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since he got his hands on it, below the Empyrean Sacredness level, only Agatha had been able to fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even some newly-made Empyrean Sacredness warriors had crumbled under its power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha's win had been a one-off; there was no way it would happen again. He was dead set on victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a fearsome blizzard roared towards Osborne, Horace grinned in satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in an instant, that grin froze on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, looking as calm as a cucumber in the face of the approaching tempest, took a step forward. His body was enveloped in flickering black flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The icy energy just fizzled out as he advanced; not a single snowflake could get anywhere near him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He strolled steadily out of the blizzard, his cheeks rosy, as if the bone-chilling cold was nothing but a gentle breeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way!" Horace gasped, his face a picture of shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson and Broderick were gobsmacked too. If they hadn't felt that bone-numbing chill for themselves, they might've thought Horace was just messing around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Osborne is shrugging off the power of Horace's Frost-invoking Canvas?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How on earth is he pulling that off?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And what are those black flames? They give off an eerie vibe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said coolly, "Is that all your Frost-invoking Canvas can do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If so, you're not all that great! No wonder you can't beat Agatha... So, are you ready to eat dirt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he pulled back the string of his Bloodwrought Bow, and Sacred Power arrows quickly materialized in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace's expression turned as gloomy as a thundercloud, and he gritted his teeth in sheer vexation. "Even if your flames can neutralize the Frost-invoking Canvas, thinking you can take me down is just a pipe dream. I'm leagues stronger than you, even without that thing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Drop dead!" Horace roared, unleashing his attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He channeled the Sacred Power through the Frost-invoking Canvas, aiming it right at Osborne. The might behind this strike was even more ferocious than the combined efforts of Broderick and Benson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, it was all for naught!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the Frost-invoking Canvas lost its effectiveness against Osborne, Horace's doom was sealed. Broderick and Benson had fought tooth and nail, only to fail to withstand Osborne's arrows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace stood no better chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first arrow sliced through Horace's attack like a hot knife through butter, but he managed to fend it off with his Defensive Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second arrow struck his Sacred Artifact head-on, dimming its once-bright glow and leaving a hairline crack across its surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then came the third arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace couldn't hold back any longer. Blood spurted from his mouth like a geyser as he was sent flying backward. He joined Broderick and Benson in defeat, getting flattened under Osborne's unrelenting hail of arrows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle was done and dusted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snagged a tenth of Horace's points, finally breaking past the ten-million mark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he cast his eyes toward the far-off distance, where a gorgeous girl sat serenely, eyes still shut. She seemed completely nonchalant about the fight, deep in her own preparations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Agatha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne locked his gaze on her and said calmly, "Agatha, it's our showdown now!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
