  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While Osborne was checking the list, the other contestants were also quickly reviewing it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, someone spoke up, "Excuse me, Mr. Norton, what are the uses of the resources and treasures on this list? After we find these items, can we use them ourselves instead of exchanging them for Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the voice fell, everyone turned to look.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The speaker was a woman, and almost everyone present knew her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was Brenda, a top contender for the championship just like Valentino. Many even believed she was stronger than Valentino, but because Valentino had the Starry Eye, giving him an edge in finding resources and treasures, his chances of winning were higher.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In terms of pure strength, Valentino could only rank second, while Brenda was the true number one.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Gerald also looked at Brenda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He smiled and said, "The rules of the Zone Duel are open. The resources and treasures you find on Abyssal Planet can be exchanged for Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>, which will ultimately determine the rankings. Alternatively, you can choose to keep those items for yourself without exchanging them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course, I don't recommend you do that! The value of each resource and treasure on the list has been carefully calculated by us. Unless there are special circumstances, exchanging them for Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> is more worthwhile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all, the higher the Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>, the higher the ranking, and with a higher ranking, you can earn secondary rewards. As for the effects and uses of the items on the list, I can't tell you. You can try them out yourselves.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But if something goes wrong, you'll have to take responsibility yourselves. If you don't know how to use those things, using them recklessly can be life-threatening."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda nodded upon hearing this. "Thank you for clarifying, Mr. Norton!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda put away the list and said no more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Valentino also spoke, "May I ask, Mr. Norton, during the zone duel, can we freely seize the resources and treasures others have found? Can we take everything, or is it like the state duel, where only one-tenth can be taken?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald smiled faintly, "You can seize all of others' resources, as long as you have the ability! I&rsquo;ve said before, the rules of the zone duel are open. Even if you kill someone to snatch their Sacred Artifact, no referee will stop you, as long as you're not afraid of retaliation from their gang elders."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he finished speaking, intense uproar erupted at the scene, and many people's expressions changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? You can even snatch the opponent's Sacred Artifact? Even killing won't be interfered with by the referee?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's over! If that's the case, the danger of the zone duel has skyrocketed! Especially for us disciples from Second-rate Powers... Even if we're killed by those from First-rate Powers, our sect elders probably won't avenge us, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This rule is way too open!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the people from Second-rate Powers all looked grim. In contrast, those from First-rate Powers had cold smirks on their faces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They stared at those from Second-rate Powers as if eyeing prey.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy and Clara frowned deeply at this moment, looking a bit worried. "Rules like this aren't very friendly to us!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne also nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Gerald spoke, "Quiet! The reason this zone duel has such open rules is to simulate real scenarios! None of you are the top geniuses of your regions, nor flowers in a greenhouse!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you're scared, you can quit the zone duel now! Also, during the zone duel, if you encounter danger, you can quit at any time! Just shout 'quit,' and the referee will step in to protect you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, in that case, all the resources and treasures you've gained must be left behind! But at least, you can keep your own Sacred Artifact and save your lives!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Gerald finished speaking, the crowd started discussing again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, we can quit anytime! Although quitting means no results, at least we don't have to worry about our Sacred Artifact being taken or getting killed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those from the Second-rate Power breathed a slight sigh of relief at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for those from the First-rate Power, they couldn't help feeling a bit disappointed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only Valentino sneered at this moment, "Actually, as long as you act fast enough and don't give your opponents a chance to admit defeat and quit, you can take them out before they speak and claim everything they have!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he finished speaking, many people's expressions changed again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Valentino calmly said, "I advise those who encounter me to hand over the resources and treasures they've found before I make a move, then quit immediately. That way, at least you'll keep your life. Otherwise, for the championship of the zone duel, I won't hold back! No matter which faction you're from, I don't mind being ruthless! Feel free to let your gang's elders come after me for revenge."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After he finished speaking, everyone's expressions turned even darker.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even some people from the First-rate Power looked at Valentino with deep apprehension.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright!" Gerald interrupted everyone at this moment, "You already know the rules. You have the last ten minutes. After ten minutes, you will be transported to Abyssal Planet to officially start the zone duel!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, what resources or treasures are you planning to look for?" At this moment, Leroy and Clara both looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne calmly said, "I&rsquo;ll probably head to the eastern part of Abyssal Planet to look for Dark Mandala. After all, a single Dark Mandala can be exchanged for one million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>. Besides that, the most valuable would be the Abyssal Bone. If it&rsquo;s an advanced Empyrean Sacredness Abyssal Bone, it can be exchanged for three million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He continued, "However, Abyssal Bone is distributed across the entire Abyssal Planet, so it&rsquo;s the same wherever you go. Moreover, Abyssal Planet is just a small resource planet. In such an environment, it&rsquo;s impossible for too many Empyrean Sacredness warriors to emerge, let alone those reaching advanced Empyrean Sacredness, which are likely even rarer."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two women nodded upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They knew Osborne's goal was to win the championship, so he would definitely aim for the most valuable resources and treasures.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in that case, the danger would definitely be greater.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What about you? What are you planning to do?" Osborne asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy said, "I'm planning to look for Bloody Ivy. Bloody Ivy is in the western desert of Abyssal Planet, which is said to be scorching, but it suits me perfectly. Most importantly, Bloody Ivy is quite valuable too&mdash;one can be exchanged for five thousand Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>. Moreover, plants like Bloody Ivy are likely to appear in clusters."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara also said, "I'm planning to head to the west of Abyssal Planet to look for Bloody Ivy. Although zone duels don't allow contestants to team up, Leroy and I won't be too far apart, so we can look out for each other in special situations. Abyssal Planet isn't just about competitors; there are also many native creatures! When dealing with these native creatures, we can join forces."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded again. "Be careful, both of you! If things go wrong, withdraw immediately. Staying alive is the most important!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two women nodded and said, "You be careful too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald said, "Alright, time's up! All contestants, enter the translocator immediately. The destination is Abyssal Planet!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
