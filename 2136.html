  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel was now fully immersed in battle. After two consecutive attacks were effortlessly blocked by Alfreda's Luminous Elven Wings, he could feel his anger boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The light surrounding him blazed even brighter, a reflection of his growing frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me show you why I became the first Oracle Heir of the Ethereal Elven Temple ten </span><span>millennia</span><span> ago! I fought toe-to-toe with the Sacred Dragon Clan's geniuses, and now I've risen to be the third Oracle Heir once again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Princess Alfreda, you think those wings will keep you safe?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How laughable!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch as I shatter your Luminous Elven Wings! Spark of Piercing Light!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Uriel transformed into a streak of blinding light, </span><span>launched</span><span> himself at Alfreda with terrifying speed, and crashing into her Luminous Elven Wings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deafening explosion echoed as Alfreda, encased in her wings, was violently thrown back. The wings trembled under the force, </span><span>with </span><span>fissures appearing as if they were on the verge of collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's face paled slightly, but she quickly regained her composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a powerful attack! But sadly, it's still not enough compared to Osborne's Dimensional Maw! You'll need more than that to break my Luminous Elven Wings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With renewed determination, Alfreda stopped playing defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her wings flared to life, unleashing a barrage of Sacred Power blades that shot toward Uriel at breakneck speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel's expression darkened as he realized that despite his earlier onslaught, he hadn't managed to break through Alfreda's defenses. The incoming Sacred Power blades forced him to act quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He expanded the light around him, forming a massive protective barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blades collided with his barrier, creating a thunderous roar. The barrier shattered under the pressure, and Uriel's expression shifted to one of alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of my way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The explosive force scattered the Sacred Power blades, but Alfreda's Luminous Elven Wings continued to flap relentlessly, sending an unending stream of Sacred Power blades toward him once more. Uriel's face paled as he realized he could no longer afford to take hits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He transformed into a beam of light again, darting away to evade the assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's confidence surged as she watched him dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uriel, didn't you say you'd show me how powerful you are? Is running </span><span>all</span><span> you can do?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pathetic! I must have overestimated you! You're nowhere near Osborne's level!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each passing moment, Alfreda's confidence grew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that Uriel lacked strength; it was that Alfreda was exceptionally powerful. Her overall score on the Astral Testing Arch was Class SS, just a step away from becoming a Celestial Progeny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In all of Elf City, few could rival her talent. While Uriel had impressive abilities, they still fell short compared to hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Alfreda had mastered the Luminous Elven Wings, which allowed her to harness Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though it was a weakened version, it was still far superior to Uriel's divine power or Light Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, even with a slight advantage in cultivation level, Uriel found himself struggling </span><span>against her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel, now a blur of light, darted around, his eyes filled with icy determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't anticipated that Alfreda would be so difficult to deal with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her Luminous Elven Wings were clearly not something she had just mastered; she wielded them with a mastery that exceeded his expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel was trapped in a defensive position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wings' protection was proving nearly impossible to breach, and he couldn't afford to take any chances with their relentless attacks. If this kept up, he wouldn't stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's taunts pierced Uriel like a dagger, igniting a fury within him that he had never felt before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to kill you!" he roared, his voice echoing with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Uriel was consumed by his anger, abandoning all restraint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even forgot about the Ascension Seven Umbra World creature lurking nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All that mattered now was eliminating Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His attacks slammed against her Luminous Elven Wings, creating cracks but failing to shatter them completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustration boiled over; he realized he couldn't truly harm her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that realization, Alfreda surged forward, wielding her Arcane Staff of Nature. Vines of vibrant green energy erupted from the ground, lashing out at Uriel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, he transformed into a beam of light, darting away to evade her strikes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This only fueled his anger further, leaving him feeling helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew he couldn't take Alfreda down alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this really all you've got, Uriel? Pathetic! You can only rely on ambushes to threaten me! In a fair fight, you seem so weak. You dare call yourself the top talent of the younger generation of the Elf Race? How laughable!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you trained for two lifetimes, you'd still fall short!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, you're destined to lose!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's confidence soared with each passing moment. She found Uriel far easier to handle than Osborne had been. Even when Osborne was at Ascension Two, he had posed a greater challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Osborne possessed Sacred Power, and his ultimate moves could break through her Luminous Elven Wings. Uriel, on the other hand, couldn't even come close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> this is what Ascension Seven is like? If they're all like you, there's nothing to fear!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda unleashed her full power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind her, Osborne couldn't help but feel astonished. The strength she displayed now was a significant leap from just a few days ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such talent! With the right resources, she could skyrocket in power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, unaware that his words would earn him an eye roll from Alfreda if she heard him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Talent? Who could compare to Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Alfreda had completely seized the upper hand. She was dominating both offensively and defensively, leaving Uriel's exploration team members in stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Uriel let out a furious roar, his aura exploding around him and momentarily pushing Alfreda back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes burned with rage, filled with humiliation and anger at being suppressed by someone of a lower cultivation level. It felt as if all his pride and dignity were being ground into the dirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His murderous intent surged, boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wanted nothing more than to devour Alfreda whole, but he knew he couldn't do it alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he made a decisive move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bellowed, his voice laced with fury, "Everyone, listen up! Attack together!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're going to take down Princess Alfreda!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't let her leave here alive!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the news of our Sacred Artifact-level palace gets out, we'll be in deep trouble!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Uriel's furious command, the five Ascension Six warriors he brought, along with nearly a hundred Ascension Five warriors, sprang into action without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A torrent of attacks rained down on Alfreda, enveloping her in a storm of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression hardened dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An ambush? How shameless!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
