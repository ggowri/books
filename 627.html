  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at everyone solemnly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He announced, "The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> will return to </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> and start a bloody war!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am a member of the Augustine family, in charge of defending the Augustine family and the Draco Group's industries and resisting the attacks of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>. So, I need your assistance now. Are you willing to fight for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finishing speaking, Osborne looked at everyone seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, everyone's expressions became excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were at Training Base No. 6, where they had been training in secret for over 20 years. Therefore, they couldn't wait to engage in real combat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the opportunity had come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, 20 instructors and five hundred trainees all knelt on one knee before Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They shouted, "We are!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, he smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, Osborne returned to Mount Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All instructors and trainees at Training Base No. 6 would be led by No. 1 and rush to </span><span>Dampston</span><span> in the shortest time possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they needed some time to prepare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Training Base No. 6 not only consisted of instructors and trainees but also housed a wide array of weapons and equipment. There were indeed over a dozen sets of Class A defense systems alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, there were a large number of Draco Group's most advanced combat robots and combat drones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Osborne, all of these were unexpected pleasant surprises.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The combination of the instructors and trainees with these advanced weapon systems </span><span>was what allowed them to unleash their full potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Training Base No. 6 is much more affluent than </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security Services! It's a good opportunity to have them join </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security Services.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With them, </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security Services will undoubtedly be considered one of the top security companies in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>! Which other security company can boast such a large number of skilled individuals and advanced weaponry?" Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, he felt a little proud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne returned to Third Estate and thought, "Owen thought that I had no backing and support, which is why he dared to be so arrogant. He will surely have an interesting expression as he sees No. 1 and the others I have on my side."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, on Mount Seven, the atmosphere had become somewhat calm. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nine-branch bloodlines of the Augustine family would also participate in the upcoming war against the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And they each had their own heir-in-waiting whom they supported.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The branch bloodlines of Marcelin and Ransford both supported Lance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew recruited the other six branch bloodlines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt helpless about this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew's methods were indeed powerful. Not only did he have the most elders supporting him, but he also won over many branch bloodlines, which became his supporters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although I also have the support of Training Base No. 6, it is still far behind the support of Vincent, Matthew, and even Emma!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even Lance has the support of branch bloodlines of </span><span>Yalynch</span><span>, Marcelin, and Ransford. The combined strength of these three branch bloodlines is definitely stronger than that of Training Base No. 6."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Indeed, winning over them and securing the first place in the selection of the heir is undoubtedly a challenging task for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression became solemn again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I must continue to enhance my strength to have a glimmer of hope of winning!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finishing thinking about it, Osborne walked into Third Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He prepared to pack up and rush back to </span><span>Dampston</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was still one thing he hadn't done, so he was unwilling to go back now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, this matter was not up to him to decide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He will come, right?" Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He greeted them and instructed them to pack their belongings. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne then proceeded alone to the top floor of the mansion, absorbing the star power to enhance his strength while patiently waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed that the person he was waiting for would definitely come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't know how long it had been. But he was suddenly startled and felt something unusual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned quickly and looked behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne saw an old figure who had appeared behind him at some point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This old figure held a black cat in one hand and a gold scepter in the other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the Godfather!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's breathing suddenly became rapid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the Godfather came to meet him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you know that I was coming?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather spoke, and at this moment, his expression was no longer as serious as it was at the birthday party but with a faint smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and said calmly, "You once said that when I completed the fifth test you set for the heir, you would personally come to see me! I believe that if you cannot even fulfill this promise, then you don't deserve to be my grandfather!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished speaking, the Godfather was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't seem to expect Osborne to say this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since he became the underground king of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> and became the Godfather, no younger generation of the Augustine family dared to speak to him like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long time, the Godfather sighed, "You're right. I'm not a qualified grandfather or a qualified father. You must have a lot of resentment, right? You must also have a lot of questions about your parents that you want to ask me, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, you are strong enough to know everything! If you want to know anything, just ask me, and I will tell you.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Osborne trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he finally qualified to know everything about his parents?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne clenched his fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at the Godfather and asked his first question.</span></p><div class="pagination">
