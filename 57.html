  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Fortunately, the safe house was just three hundred yards ahead, and Osborne, Clarissa, and Paul reached it swiftly at their pace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was built into the mountains.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Before them loomed a massive alloy door, set against a backdrop of dense forest. Once they navigated through the woods and walked through the door, their enemies would be unable to breach it, even with rocket launchers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Breathless, Clarissa turned around and shouted, &ldquo;Osborne, hurry up. We&rsquo;re almost there.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne hesitated briefly before speeding up and reaching her side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll cover you. You and Ms. Radcliffe open the safe house first, and I&rsquo;ll return shortly,&rdquo; Paul said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne snorted, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say your men were nearby? Why didn&rsquo;t I see them?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He narrowed his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Embarrassed, Paul said icily, &ldquo;How should I know? The situation is so complicated. They may have gone to support other places. Anyway, since you are unwilling to cover the rear, I&rsquo;ll take care of it. Please escort Ms. Radcliffe to the safe house immediately.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He pivoted around and rushed toward the enemies behind him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ms. Radcliffe, be careful.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne cast a meaningful glance at Paul&rsquo;s back but said nothing. After reminding Clarissa, he started sorting through his weapons.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The pistol still held three bullets. In addition to that, there was a riot shield and two alloy daggers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne frowned and pushed the riot shield to Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He whispered, &ldquo;Take good care of yourself later. I may not be able to protect you. Also, don&rsquo;t trust anyone.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Without waiting for Clarissa&rsquo;s reply, he suddenly raised the pistol and pulled the trigger toward a shadow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He fired three rounds in a row, instantly emptying the last three bullets in the magazine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The next instant, a deep, pained growl echoed, followed by a black shadow darting out quickly from the darkness and lunging at Osborne and Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was utterly terrifying. Its body was swiftly cloaked in dark fur, its eyes bloodshot like a wild beast&rsquo;s, and its claws razor-sharp. It moved low to the ground, sprinting at incredible speed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was not a beast but a man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s three bullets cut off one of his cheeks, rendering his face extremely grotesque and horrifying, yet still distinctly human.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Oh no, it&rsquo;s actually a metahuman. Shape-shifting metahuman?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After seeing the black shadow&rsquo;s transformation clearly, Osborne took a deep breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At the same time, several similar black shadows suddenly emerged from the nearby darkness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Their bodies swiftly became shrouded in fur, resembling wild animals.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What the hell are these?&rdquo; Osborne growled, his entire body tense as he shielded Clarissa protectively behind him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Be careful!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Noticing these dark shadows, Clarissa was not entirely surprised. Overwhelmed with fear and concern, she shouted, &ldquo;Osborne, they&rsquo;re shape-shifting wolf metahumans.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Wolf metahumans, also known as werewolves, possess incredible speed, excellent strength, formidable defenses, as well as exceptional vitality. They are exceedingly challenging to defeat. Each one ranks at least Class E, with some reaching Class D or even Class C.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa&rsquo;s exclamation made Osborne&rsquo;s expression even more serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There existed two types of metahumans, innate and acquired. Both arose from genetic mutations, but the latter were typically engineered within laboratories.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Shape-shifting metahumans, in particular, were predominantly created in laboratories.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">By extracting genes from wild animals and developing a specialized gene mutation drug, it was once possible for human genes to mutate when injected into humans, granting them the ability to transform into wild beasts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Once successful, both strength and speed would become as formidable as those of a wild beast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">These werewolves were the result of mutations using the most powerful genes from wild wolves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They were scarier than real wild wolves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In terms of speed, strength, defense, and even vitality, they significantly surpassed ordinary humans.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was difficult to kill them with conventional thermal weapons.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The werewolf, its head half severed by bullets yet still lunging toward Osborne, was utterly chilling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There were a total of ten werewolves, frantically pouncing on Osborne and Clarissa. The weakest among them were Class E metahumans, while the strongest approached those at Class C.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even Osborne found himself fearful in such a situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had once fought Milo on equal footing in Class C, but Milo specialized in mental control, whereas his Satan&rsquo;s Eye happened to counter Milo&rsquo;s abilities effectively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Despite Milo&rsquo;s considerable power, it did not match the strength of a werewolf.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Furthermore, ten werewolves were charging toward Osborne like a pack of wolves now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He threw away the pistol with an empty magazine and tightly grasped the two alloy daggers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What are their weaknesses?&rdquo; Osborne asked quickly and calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa replied, &ldquo;Their weakness lies in their resilient hearts from which shape-shifting metahumans draw strength. Only by destroying their hearts can you eliminate them quickly.&rdquo;</p><div class="pagination">
