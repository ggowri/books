  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared in shock at the scene before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the vast space, a colossal mosquito stood, towering at least 16 feet high, with a wingspan stretching a daunting 33 feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its wings were thin and translucent, covered in minute, scalelike patterns that shimmered like razor-sharp blades, displaying subtle shifts in color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mosquito's legs were long and slender, lined with rows of sharp, backward-facing barbs resembling serrated saw teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its head sported a pair of bright, intense eyes that were now fixed on Osborne with a chilling gaze. At the end of its long, slender antennae was a piercingly sharp proboscis shaped like a spear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could feel an overwhelming sense of dread emanating from the creature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gasped involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Dark Deity? It's actually a gigantic mosquito? And its proboscis looks like it's injured!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face grew serious as he quickly noticed Kendra and Yulissa lying unconscious on the ground. They appeared unharmed, breathing steadily. Osborne let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned his gaze back to the monstrous mosquito.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had imagined many forms for the Dark Deity&mdash;three eyes, six arms, or an oversized head with long legs&mdash;but he never expected it to be a giant bloodsucker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The grotesque legs, wings, and proboscis made his skin crawl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gripping his Rock Smasher and Volt Hammer tightly, Osborne tensed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Deity emitted a strange noise, incomprehensible to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, its form began to shift, twisting and folding until it transformed into a stunning woman clad in black armor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The armor barely covered her most essential parts, accentuating her voluptuous figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her beautiful legs, prominent chest, and exquisite face were almost a mirror image of a more revealing Kendra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared, dumbfounded. "It transformed into Kendra! This is insane!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Deity, now in human form, chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, another Earthling."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, the voice sounded odd, but it quickly normalized, with excitement flickering in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Another Earthling! Fantastic! I sense a tremendous amount of blood energy within you. Your body, your energy, and your blood are far stronger than those two combined!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once I consume you and absorb your energy and blood, I'll heal most of my injuries. Then that damned Blue Planet deity outside won't stand a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to slaughter all Earthlings, drain their blood, and restore my power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll exterminate all Blue Planet deities!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With mounting excitement, she began to stride toward Osborne, her initial awkward gait smoothing into a confident walk, as if she'd always had a human body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was a picture of shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Indeed, it's the Dark Deity! It not only transforms into a human form but adapts so quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep breath to steady himself and said firmly, "So, you're the Dark Deity from beyond the stars? What's your name? Dark Deity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smirked. "Perhaps, but you can call me Mosley. Though you're about to die, so knowing my name won't do you any good. Just prepare to be my lunch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Mosley finished speaking, a chilling, killing intent and a terrifying surge of power erupted from her, radiating an immense and dangerous force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Psychic Blast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned grave. Even though Mosley's current strength was merely at the level of a Class S Supreme Overlord, she was still a genuine deity. He wasn't about to underestimate her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the onslaught of Mosley's mental assault, he immediately activated his Soul Barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This barrier, taught to him by Isa, was known for its extraordinary defensive capabilities against psychic attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Mosley's Psychic Blast reached him, it collided with the Soul Barrier, crashing into his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt the intensity of the Psychic Blast and couldn't help but grimace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "This Psychic Blast is incredibly powerful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I hadn't activated the Soul Barrier and were just an ordinary Class AAA, I'd probably be knocked out instantly, my soul shattered by such an attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Osborne had the Soul Barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The powerful Psychic Blast was entirely blocked by the barrier, unable to affect his mental state or soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mosley's face showed a hint of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder your energy and blood are so formidable. You've got some skill if you can withstand my psychic attack. Too bad you're still going to die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't wait to drain every drop of your blood!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, my little treasure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Mosley's form began to twist and shift once more.</span></p><div class="pagination">
