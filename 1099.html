  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian patted Osborne hard on the shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian was conscious the whole time and aware of everything going on around him. The moment the assassins from the Eityreia Organization descended on the Augustine family, hunting them like prey, he felt despair when the family had no hope left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian couldn't control his body and couldn't save the Augustines. He could only watch them die and listen to their screams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then Osborne appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Sebastian was proud. He had never felt prouder to have such a grandson. He even thought that if he were to die right then and there, it would have been worth it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaving the Augustine family in Osborne's hands filled Sebastian with peace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, Osborne had used the Light of Redemption to completely heal Sebastian's wounds, restoring his body to its prime like it had been over twenty years ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the surge of strength coursing through his veins, Sebastian was overwhelmed with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but smile, astonished by the force of Sebastian's enthusiastic pats on his shoulder. "Grandpa, did your power just break through to a new level?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian chuckled at the question, "No, not quite. More accurately, it's recovery. You see, over twenty years ago, I suffered a serious injury. It didn't just halt my progress, it set me back." His face grew grave as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Over twenty years ago, Grandpa, you suffered a serious injury? What happened? Who did this to you?" Osborne asked, shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had always found it odd that Sebastian, who had once ranked 65th on the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings thirty years ago, had not only failed to climb higher but had fallen to somewhere in the seventies. And despite being only eighty years old, Sebastian looked far older than others of his rank and age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew that once someone reached Class S strength, their body transformed. They didn't just grow stronger. Their lifespan extended significantly. Some could even live to be two hundred or more years old.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Took Helios Thornberry, for example. He was a legendary figure for over two hundred years and still held the top spot in the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings. Almost everyone believed he was still alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian might not have been as powerful as Helios Thornberry, but he was in the same league, a top-tier Class S. How could someone like him appear so old at just eighty, even to the point of urgently seeking a successor?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had never understood it before, but now he did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over twenty years ago, Sebastian had suffered a grave injury, one that not only stunted his growth in power but also shortened his lifespan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until now that Osborne used the Class S Light of Redemption to heal every hidden injury in Sebastian's body, including the one from over two decades ago, that Sebastian's youth and strength had returned, and his power had even improved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, who injured you all those years ago?" Osborne pressed again, his brow furrowing as he noticed Sebastian's silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian sighed deeply before saying, "Fine. It's time I told you. You've grown enough to know the truth. The one who injured me was Helios Thornberry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Osborne was stunned. He thought, "Helios Thornberry? Twenty years ago, Grandpa had fought against Helios and been wounded? But why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Osborne could voice his questions, Sebastian's expression turned cold as he continued, "More than twenty years ago, your parents vanished. I searched everywhere, desperately, but I couldn't find them. After a thorough investigation, I realized there were only three people capable and powerful enough to abduct them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The first was the King of the Aberrants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The second was Emperor Dare, the top assassin of the Eityreia Organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And the third was Reginald, the deputy leader of the League of Divine Descent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At that time, Gerardo was deeply hidden. He knew he wasn't my match, and with his spatial power, I had no way of tracking him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for Emperor Dare, he was shrouded in even more mystery. I couldn't locate him either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So I went to the League of Divine Descent, hoping to find your parents. But instead of meeting Reginald, I ran into Helios.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once he learned why I was there, Helios attacked me on the spot! It only took one move, just one move, and I was gravely injured."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's face grew tense as he recalled the memory, his eyes still filled with a hint of disbelief. "At that time, I had just broken through to a new level of strength. My rank on the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings was 65th, but after my breakthrough, I was confident I could push into the top 50, maybe even the top 40!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But at my peak, Helios still defeated me with a single strike! That blow not only severely injured me, but it also caused my strength to plummet and shortened my lifespan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I founded the medical research institute to find a way to heal myself, but no solution ever worked until now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because of you, I've finally regained my peak strength, perhaps even surpassed it."</span></p><div class="pagination">
