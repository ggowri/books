  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, you... when did your powers break through?" Dylan asked, his face filled with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a Class A- metahuman, yet the massive Divine and Demonic Wings on Clarissa's back were exerting immense pressure on Dylan. This could only mean that Clarissa had reached at least Class B+.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa didn't answer his question. Instead, she calmly said, "Are you still going to control me and force me to marry Alexander? If that's the case, then let's get this over with. I never expected that my first opponent after my powers advanced would be my own family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she finished speaking, her face showed a trace of bitterness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that bitterness quickly turned into resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan's expression darkened. The wedding was already in progress. There was no way to stop it now. The Radcliffe family couldn't afford to bear the wrath of the Paltrow family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this thought, he took a deep breath. "Clarissa, I'm sorry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Dylan made his move. He summoned the power of the earth element, transforming it into shackles that he directed towards Clarissa, attempting to restrain her once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Break!" Clarissa remained calm. With a simple tap of her finger, the earth element shackles that Dylan controlled instantly shattered, failing even to touch her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan was utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Clarissa was his daughter, and he didn't want to hurt her, so he held back his full strength, the ease with which she dismantled his powers left him in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, he had a sinking feeling that even if he had used all his strength, he still wouldn't have been able to do anything to Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since when did Clarissa become so powerful?" he wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me handle this!" Eugen stepped forward, his cold eyes fixed on Clarissa as he calmly said, "There's no point fighting this, Clarissa. You may have gotten stronger, but you're still no Class A Power Master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I surpassed Class A Power Master thirty years ago. Although it's not the most impressive achievement, dealing with a Class B+ metahuman like you will be easy. You can't fight with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Clarissa looked at Eugen seriously, taking a deep breath. "Is that so? Well, I'm still going to try!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugen snorted, "Humph! Then don't blame me for what happens next."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Eugen made his move. As an earth elemental metahuman himself, he lightly waved his hand, and vines formed from earth elemental energy suddenly emerged from the ground beneath Clarissa, quickly wrapping around her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugen also attempted to restrain Clarissa, but his power and control were far superior to Dylan's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just an instant, Clarissa was subdued again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She muttered under her breath, "So this is the strength of a Class A Power Master? It's nothing special!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, the massive Divine and Demonic Wings behind her suddenly shook with tremendous force, instantly shattering the bonds that held her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugen was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was shocked that he couldn't control Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could Clarissa's Divine and Demonic Wings be so powerful?" he wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugen's expression grew serious as he felt at a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Clarissa was his granddaughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't recklessly attack Clarissa, so he had to find a way to restrain her. As a result, he couldn't even use half of his full strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with the Divine and Demonic Wings, he had no idea what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on with you guys? Can't you even handle this?" At that moment, Alexander stepped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He noticed the massive Divine and Demonic Wings behind Clarissa and felt the surge of energy radiating from her. His eyes lit up instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Narrowing his eyes slightly, he coldly said, "Looks like you're waiting for Osborne, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa responded coldly, "That's right!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered, "He's not coming! He wouldn't dare show up, because he knows the moment he does, he'll be dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa took a deep breath. "No, he will definitely come!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, really?" Alexander scoffed. "You have so much faith in him! Too bad he's left you hanging, all alone, to deal with this. Do you think you can stand up to me? I'll give you one last chance. Agree to marry me, or don't blame me for what happens next!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your father and grandfather might go easy on you, but I won't. As long as you're breathing, nothing else matters to me. All I want is your body and the fate power you possess. Whether you're willing to marry me or not, I couldn't care less!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes grew colder, filled with menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa let out a laugh, then turned to Dylan and Eugen. "Grandpa, Father, did you hear that? This is the husband you found for me? This is what you said was for my own good? Ha! You've got to be kidding me! He has the nerve to say he's only interested in my body and my fate power right in front of you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What makes you think marrying him would make me happy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan and Eugen's faces turned sullen. They both felt Alexander's words were way out of line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander was unfazed. He sneered, "I'm just being honest, so I hope you won't take it personally. This is your last chance. Stop resisting and let's get on with this wedding. Or else, I'll have to take matters into my own hands!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes flashed with a dangerous threat as he spoke.</span></p><div class="pagination">
