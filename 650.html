  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all Osborne's fault!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen felt that if Osborne hadn't successfully attacked the two rare metal mines, he wouldn't have perceived their defenses as weak and wouldn't have sent his men to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn Osborne! You dare to trap me. I won't let you go!" Owen seethed, clenching his fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had shattered his dream of topping the scoreboard, which cost him six Class </span><span>AA experts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Owen's hatred for Osborne was intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the crowd watched Owen vent his anger, they exchanged glances in disbelief, knowing someone had to take responsibility for such a significant loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they understood that Owen should be held accountable for giving the orders, Osborne had never explicitly stated that the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' defenses were weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimately, it was Owen's speculation that led to the decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen had been too greedy for credit, hastily ordering the attack without proper investigation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything was Owen's fault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Owen was their Young Lord, the person they wanted to support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> they were reluctant to blame him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, the responsibility fell squarely on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right! If Osborne had warned us about the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' strength, we wouldn't have sent sneak attack squads!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all Osborne's fault for making us lose six Class AA experts! We can't let him off easily!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We want revenge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was indignant and accused Osborne, placing all the blame for the loss on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen's expression finally looked better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tightened his fists and declared, "Osborne! You dared to trap me. I will never forgive you! Even if I can't make it to the top three in this successor selection, I want you to suffer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen's face was full of murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen realized that losing six Class AA experts made it unlikely for him to reach the top three. Now, he only wanted to bring Osborne down, or even see him dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brother, I have a plan to deal with Osborne!" Evelynn suddenly spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen turned to her, intrigued. "What's your idea?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold smile, Evelynn replied, "We can use someone else to eliminate him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She explained, "I recently traveled to </span><span>Dampston</span><span> to find the Radcliffe family's </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span>, who possesses a divine artifacts scepter. I intended to steal it, but before I could act, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> declared war."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've confirmed that Clarissa is hiding in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, secluded and unable to leave while she attempts to reach the Class A master realm. I believe Osborne is in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> to protect her, not to confront the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen's eyes lit up. "So, you mean we can leak Clarissa's location to the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> and let them deal with her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn nodded with a smile. "Exactly! Osborne won't stand by while the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> harm her. He'll have to confront them directly! With the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' strength, Osborne will be..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dead!" Owen's excitement grew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perfect! In this case, I don't believe Osborne will still be alive. He tricked me once, so I will trick him and make him regret going against me! I'll handle this myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne was underground, merging the light elemental essence, unaware of Owen's hatred and putting all the blame for the loss of six Class AA experts on him, preparing to use the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he knew it, he wouldn't bother to care about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, it had reached a critical moment for him to fuse the essence of light elemental.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he expected, fusing the light elemental essence was proving far more challenging than any other elemental essence due to its immense power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If elemental essence were ranked, ordinary ones would be level one, mutated ones level two, while his light elemental essence was at least level five or six, far beyond the rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, his light elemental essence was overwhelmingly more powerful than all his other element essences combined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was simply impossible to fuse the light elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, it seemed to be restrained by a special force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without it, Osborne would have been dead by the time he swallowed the light elemental essence, let alone fusing it into Devil's Light.</span></p><div class="pagination">
