  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy would never have expected that, faced with such a huge harvest, Osborne was not happy but rather a bit dissatisfied.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Continuing to hunt native creatures like this won't yield much more! After all, it's easy to take them down, but dealing with the corpses afterward... Clara and Leroy are already struggling to handle the current pile of prey corpses."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No matter how many creatures I kill, if they can't handle the corpses, our harvest won't increase."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "So, the next hunts must be purposeful. I'll only target native creatures that are highly valuable and require little effort to handle! Or I'll directly search for high-value resources and treasures..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly locked onto a few targets in his mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The first is Abyssal Snake Slough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An Abyssal Snake Slough is worth fifty thousand Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> and requires no processing. Across the Abyssal, Abyssal Snakes are numerous. Even though they only shed their skin once they reach a certain level of strength, the number of Abyssal Snake Sloughs in the Abyssal is still considerable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne previously found an Abyssal Snake nest and obtained 620 Abyssal Snake Sloughs, worth 31 million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is far more cost-effective than hunting Abyssal Snakes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The second is </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moth!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The wings of the </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moth are the easiest to handle and can be removed effortlessly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moth has four wings worth 12,000 Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The most important thing is that there are plenty of </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moths.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yesterday, Osborne killed a total of 4,800 </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moths. The total value of their wings was nearly 60 million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>, accounting for almost half of the harvest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne made the </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moth his second target.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Bloody Ivy can be given up. Although Bloody Ivy is quite valuable, it's somewhat scarce and very hard to handle, a waste of time!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Let Brenda and her team of contestants handle the Bloody Ivy! As for the Abyssal Snake... I'll only look for the Abyssal Snake's nest. If it's not in the nest, I won't bother with it anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tigerstripe</span><span> Bee is also quite valuable, but there are too few of them!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Give up!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly calculated in his mind, thinking, "However, if we can find the </span><span>Tigerstripe</span><span> Bee's nest, that would be great! </span><span>Tigerstripe</span><span> Bee honey is highly valuable. Every drop of </span><span>Tigerstripe</span><span> Bee honey can be exchanged for 100 Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The honey in a </span><span>Tigerstripe</span><span> Bee's nest can be exchanged for at least several million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>, or even tens of millions of Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Additionally, Brenda's target is the northern glacier region! In the northern glacier region, there's a unique native creature that usually doesn't leave the area, called the Ice Beetle!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These Ice Beetles aren't very valuable but require no processing! One Ice Beetle can be exchanged for 2,000 Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>, but they appear in large numbers, always in swarms!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A nest of Ice Beetles can easily have tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands! As long as we kill one nest of Ice Beetles, we can exchange it for tens of millions, or even over a hundred million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne excitedly thought, "So my next targets are the Abyssal Snake Slough, </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moth, </span><span>Tigerstripe</span><span> Bee's nest, and Ice Beetle!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He made a decision in his heart and shared his thoughts with Clara and Leroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy exchanged glances. Only then did they realize that Osborne was dissatisfied with the previous day's gains and wanted to earn even more points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They said, "We'll follow your lead!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Whatever you ask us to do, we'll do it! All we can do is try our best not to hold you back and help you handle the prey's corpses."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Alright, it's decided then!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You handle the corpses first. Once you're done, have Flash take you to catch up with Brenda's team! I'll check around for any Abyssal Snake or </span><span>Tigerstripe</span><span> Bee nests, and also </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moth..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne left again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His goal was clear. He would directly ignore low-value or hard-to-handle creatures like Abyssal Snake and Bloody Ivy, but he wouldn't pass up high-value, easy-to-handle ones like </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In such circumstances, his harvest rate indeed increased significantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, another day passed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, Clara, and Leroy sat together again, tallying up the previous day's harvest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moth, a total of 7,600!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Abyssal Snake Slough, 3,200 pieces!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>Tigerstripe</span><span> Bee nests, three!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>Tigerstripe</span><span> Bee, 2,100!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Abyssal Snake poison glands, 2,000!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If converted into Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>, the total is..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"91.2 million, plus 160 million, plus 30 million, plus 16.8 million, plus 2 million..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's 300 million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara was stunned after calculating the total.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is a harvest of 300 million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although she had already anticipated that today's harvest would be much higher than yesterday's, she never expected it to reach such a level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy was equally stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>According to the distribution plan, each of them can get 60 million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> worth of resources today.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adding yesterday's 24 million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>, their Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> have exceeded 84 million, almost reaching 100 million!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne still felt a bit dissatisfied, thinking the harvest speed was still somewhat too slow, though he had already done his best.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He analyzed in his heart, "Most of my time was wasted on searching and traveling! The Abyssal Snake Slough and the </span><span>Tigerstripe</span><span> Bee's hive are both hard to find...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, tomorrow we should be leaving the desert area and entering the glacier region! By then, we&rsquo;ll encounter the Ice Beetle!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ice Beetles usually hide deep within the glacier, making them impossible for ordinary people to find! When they are in a dormant state, their aura is completely concealed, blending entirely with the glacier...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Brenda's Golden Dragon Eye can't detect the Ice Beetle! But my Satan's Eye can directly see through the ice layers to locate the dormant Ice Beetle. I will surely gain more!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne felt a bit of anticipation for tomorrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked, "Did anything happen to Brenda's team today? How are they doing?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy replied, "I had Flash take us nearby to check earlier. They're not doing too well! Since you're no longer dealing with the Abyssal Snake, Bloody Ivy, and </span><span>Tigerstripe</span><span> Bee, the attacks they faced today were much stronger than yesterday!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although they ultimately withstood the attack, many were seriously injured. Everyone is exhausted, and the Sacred Power consumption is significant! Plus, someone died..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's normal for someone to die. He could clearly feel that the number of native creatures swarming to attack was increasing, and the pressure on Brenda's team was bound to grow heavier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if they are united, casualties are inevitable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had almost wiped out all the surrounding </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moths and even killed some Abyssal Snakes and </span><span>Tigerstripe</span><span> Bees, significantly easing their pressure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, Brenda's team would face even greater pressure and suffer more casualties.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Luckily, we'll enter the glacier region tomorrow!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bloody Ivy, Abyssal Snake, and </span><span>Tigerstripe</span><span> Bee are all creatures that can't stand the cold and won't easily enter the glacier region, so their pressure will be much less!" Thinking this, Osborne no longer paid attention to Brenda's team.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now he needs to gather as many resources as possible to exchange for Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><div class="pagination">
