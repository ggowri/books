  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The six miles he traveled felt eerily quiet, with the only noticeable change being the increasing intensity of the mental strength disturbance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hadn't encountered a single Class S Dark Exotic Beast, which was a bit odd considering the sheer number he had faced earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If anything stood out, it was the overwhelming density of the surrounding energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt at least twenty times more potent than what he experienced outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this place, training would be incredibly efficient. But the mental strength disturbance was so intense that even top-tier Class S warriors would go mad in just a few minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why few could train here&mdash;except for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he trained, he relied on Satan's Eye to absorb star power, so the density of the surrounding energy wasn't a major concern for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he had no intention of using this place for training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If only we could eliminate this mental strength disturbance, this could become a training paradise! The Augustine family members could boost their cultivation speed by tenfold, even twenty-fold, compared to others! What a shame!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused as he pressed deeper into the cavern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What causes this mental strength disturbance? Is it a natural phenomenon, some kind of treasure, or the presence of a powerful entity? And why are there so many Dark </span><span>Exotic Beasts here? Could it be that a Dark Deity truly exists down in these depths?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After another six miles, Osborne's vigilance heightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This tunnel should be leading toward the heart of the Lostridge Mountains. I've already covered 12 miles, so directly above me ought to be the Lostridge Mountains!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I keep going for another 60 miles, I should reach the center of the mountains! And if I push another 200 miles beyond that, I'll break through the Lostridge Mountains and find myself beneath Newport City!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of gravity settled over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the distance he'd traveled, there were no signs of the Dark Exotic Beasts. It was as if they had appeared out of thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is strange," Osborne muttered to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued onward, covering another 12 miles, yet still found no signs of life. The tunnel seemed devoid of any Dark Exotic Beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did I take a wrong turn?" Osborne wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were three tunnels to choose from, and he had picked one at random. Now, after he had traveled over 24 miles without encountering anything unusual, so doubt crept in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the tunnel remained vast, and Osborne hadn't reached the end yet. Turning back now seemed unthinkable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to see this through! I won't be able to relax until I reach the end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that resolve, Osborne quickened his pace. He had been cautious and worried about potential surprises, but after all this time without incident, he felt emboldened to push forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His speed increased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Satan's Eye guiding him, the winding, deep tunnel felt no different than the surface. He quickly covered another 60 miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I must be at the center of the Lostridge Mountains now!" he murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne sensed the energy around him had reached a staggering density&mdash;one hundred times that of the outside world. The energy felt almost liquid, swirling like mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just breathing this air would enhance an ordinary person's strength, but the mental strength disturbance had also ramped up to a terrifying level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, a protective light membrane enveloped his soul, gently pulsating in response to the chaotic mental strength disturbance surrounding him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The mental disturbances here are so severe that any top-tier Class S who dares enter would be instantly crippled! Going mad would be the least of their worries&mdash;their souls might shatter and disintegrate in an instant! Even an average god would struggle to withstand this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the Soul Barrier that Isa had taught him, he would have turned back long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Isa was a disciple of the God of Night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Soul Barrier, without a doubt, was a soul defense technique that the God of Night had passed down to Isa. And since the God of Night was a Deity King, did anyone </span><span>really expect his methods to be simple?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, Osborne could feel the Soul Barrier starting to waver under the pressure. That alone spoke volumes about just how terrifying the mental disturbances around him were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they were to double or even triple in strength, even Osborne wouldn't be able to hold out much longer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne came to an abrupt halt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Light?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked utterly astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the deep, winding bowels of the earth, he was actually seeing a faint glow!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The light had a faint reddish hue!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A reddish light? What's ahead? Could it be... a treasure?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his hesitation, Osborne decided to press on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had come this far&mdash;over 60 miles&mdash;and had finally stumbled upon something unusual. There was no way he was turning back now; he needed to get to the bottom of this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his alertness heightened, he prepared himself to use his spatial power to escape at a moment's notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne moved forward, the red light grew more intense, transforming into a vivid, almost bloody hue, flowing like fresh blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt his heart suddenly pounding in his chest, thumping wildly.</span></p><div class="pagination">
