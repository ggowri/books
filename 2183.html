  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atticus' furious voice faded away, and the immense Ascension Stairway slowly vanished into thin air.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a surge of pure power coursing through his body, though it barely made a dent in his overall strength.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he couldn't help but feel elated after taking down Atticus. The guy was no slouch; even as a mere projection from who-knows-how-far away, his power was likely on par with Ascension Eight, maybe even Ascension Nine Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne had managed to beat him down with relative ease!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't even gone all out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just too satisfying!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A grin spread across Osborne's face as he reveled in the moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serves you right for being so cocky! If you dare to show up again, I'll take you down just as easily!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you really that happy?" Primordial chimed in, transforming into a little sapling that appeared right in front of him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged, his smile unwavering. "Come on! That was a warrior from the Sacred Tiger Clan! I just gave him a good thrashing! You told me before how terrifying the talents from the Sacred Dragon Clan and Sacred Tiger Clan are, how they're favored by this cosmos and how other races can't compete... But now it seems like they're not all that special after all!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He talks about being the prince of the White Tiger Tribe like he's something to fear... but is that all he's got? What a letdown!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial rolled its eyes at his words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, the Sacred Tiger Clan and Sacred Dragon Clan were indeed formidable and favored by the cosmos, but that was all relative.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to the average Human Community, any random member from those Apex Clans would be an insurmountable mountain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their starting point was something the ordinary Human Community could only dream of reaching after generations of striving.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when it came to Osborne, this anomaly from the Human Community, they didn't seem as impressive.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial said, clearly unimpressed. "Enough with the celebration! You've made a serious enemy now. Atticus won't let this slide easily! His true form is definitely on par with an Empyrean Sacredness warrior, maybe even stronger than the average Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And let's not forget, he's a prince of the White Tiger Tribe. If he's determined to hunt you down, he might just be able to find you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression hardened dramatically.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? He could actually track me down? Why didn't you mention this sooner?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic crept into his voice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had only dared to insult Atticus because he was convinced the guy was too far away to retaliate.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne had known Atticus could find him, he would have played it a lot safer!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial chuckled and said, "Don't freak out!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if he does find you, it'll take him some time. I just wanted to remind you not to get too cocky! The power of the Sacred Tiger Clan is something you can't even begin to fathom right now! You're not at the point where you can let your pride get the better of you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath, his earlier glee fading as he processed Primordial's words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right! I only took down Atticus' projection.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I shouldn't let it go to my head! I'll save the celebration for the day I can take on Atticus' true form!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial sighed, clearly done with the conversation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, enough of that! Now that you've had your little breakthrough, we're almost at our destination. Let's bring out the Ascending Sacred Sanctum. After two more space jumps, we'll be near Celestara Planet in deep space."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's demeanor shifted to seriousness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, we're heading back to Celestara Planet!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wonder what's been happening there. Is the God of Light managing to hold off the Dark Deity Legion? And has the war already broken out?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What about the God of Night?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Has he returned yet?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of the God of Night, Osborne couldn't help but think of Isa. His jaw clenched tightly, a mix of anger and frustration flickering in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's time to deal with this... If Isa really has chosen the God of Night, then all I can do is wish her well.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't bring himself to hate Isa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, his current achievements were largely thanks to her support. If it hadn't been for Isa saving him time and again, he would have been long gone. And if she hadn't guided him, he wouldn't have become this powerful.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, a significant part of his overwhelming combat strength was due to Isa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among all the women in his life, Isa had been the most helpful and had the deepest connection with him&mdash;perhaps even more than Clarissa!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Isa truly chose the God of Night, Osborne couldn't find it in himself to be angry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he wanted was clarity&mdash;to understand the truth, to know why she made such a choice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go! Back to Celestara Planet!" he declared, releasing the Ascending Sacred Sanctum to continue its spatial transmission toward Celestara Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Settling into a cross-legged position, he began to assess his strength and adjust his state.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew that upon returning to Celestara Planet, he would likely be thrown into the thick of battle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And his opponents?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two strongest beings on Celestara Planet: Lord Malevolence and the God of Night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perfectly merging the World Tree fragments not only granted me the Chaotic Spiritual Root, eliminating concerns about combat fatigue, but it also strengthened my physical form, bringing me to the mid-stage Infinite Sacred Body and the Myriadfold Dragon Might. My elemental essences have seen significant boosts!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Space elemental essence, dark elemental essence, and lightning elemental essence have all improved to some extent! However, since they were already at Level Ten, any enhancements won't lead to a qualitative change unless they reach Sacredness Level, which limits their impact on my overall strength.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other hand, my power surged significantly after breaking through to Ascension Four! I should be able to handle an average Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King with ease!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ascension Nine? That shouldn't be a problem either!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ascension Ten? That's a different story.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt uncertain. He knew he was powerful among Supernal Deity Kings, but he'd never fought an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King, so he wasn't sure if he could match up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wonder what cultivation levels Lord Malevolence and the God of Night are at.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hope they aren't Ascension Ten!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they're not Ascension Ten, I'm confident I can handle them and come out on top!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's time for the war on Celestara Planet to come to an end!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lost in thought, Osborne suddenly felt the Ascending Sacred Sanctum jolt violently, halting its spatial transmission.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly glanced around, his eyes lighting up with recognition.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the lair of the Eighth World Tree offshoot, and they were now very close to Celestara Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are we finally here?!" he exclaimed, feeling his energy surge back to its peak as he stood up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ascending Sacred Sanctum! Head this way to exit deep space and reach Celestara Planet!" he commanded, excitement bubbling within him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Ascending Sacred Sanctum got closer to Celestara Planet, anticipation shone on Osborne's handsome face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's been a month! Celestara Planet, I am back!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
