  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick sneered, "I don't care who you are! No matter who you are, you're doomed today! Just a nobody. Even if you gained some fortune in the Skyfall Casket, your cultivation level is merely at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In front of me, you're not worthy to fight me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista, with a sinister sneer, said, "Honey, once the Protective Barrier is broken, can you leave this boy to me? I&rsquo;ll make sure to torture him thoroughly and let him die in extreme pain!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, a crazed killing intent flashed in Callista's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She would never forget how, in Necropolis City, Osborne used the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket to threaten Frederick, forcing him to ruthlessly slap her face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was her most humiliating moment!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She must avenge this grudge!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was determined to skin Osborne, crush his bones, and even eat his flesh!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, her killing intent boiled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Beside her, Weston, Quinn, Naomi, and the others all stared at Osborne with dark expressions, their eyes filled with killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had actually been parasitized by Soulbane Parasites.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But after the Soulbane Parasites devoured their memories, they would possess their emotions or still be influenced by them, continuing to hate Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, in Necropolis City, they were also slapped hard by Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And all of this was because of Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Father, once we catch this boy, can you hand him over to me? I want to torture him properly and make him regret provoking me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Weston said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quinn and Naomi also requested Frederick at this moment to let them torture Osborne and vent their anger after the Protective Barrier breaks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick agreed to all of it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He snorted coldly, "Don't worry. Once the Protective Barrier is broken, none of them will escape! Everyone can torture him as much as they want."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After he finished speaking, everyone looked at Osborne with disdain, as if looking at a dead man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne didn't care at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His face was still changing. Under everyone's gaze, his face had become completely different, and even his aura had entirely transformed with the help of the Sublime Concealment Orb.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And his current appearance and aura were exactly the same as his past self!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Frederick, Callista, and even Weston, Quinn, and the others staring at him were all stunned, looking at Osborne's current face in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Memories buried deep in their minds quickly surfaced.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's you, you bastard!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bastard, it's actually you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How could it be you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So you are that bastard!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Several people exclaimed, then their eyes flashed with coldness and disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Looks like you all still remember me! That's right! I am the bastard you humiliated and tortured over a thousand years ago! Over a thousand years ago, I was exiled from the Palace of the Glorious Divine Kingdom!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm back!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne finished speaking, no longer suppressing the anger, hatred, and killing intent in his heart. The terrifying killing intent boiled deep within him. He stared intently at Frederick, Callista, and the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had waited for this day for a long time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From the day he regained the memories of his past life, he secretly vowed to make everyone who had humiliated and tortured him in his previous life pay the price!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He also secretly vowed to find the person who framed his mother!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He must kill Frederick!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because Frederick personally ordered the execution of Osborne's mother and exiled Osborne from the Palace!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All the hatred and anger must be borne by someone!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, it's the beginning of his revenge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After revealing his identity, Osborne was boiling with killing intent. He stared at Frederick with bloodshot eyes and said coldly, "Emperor Frederick, you are unworthy of being a father! In your eyes, there's only power and cultivation level! You are utterly unfit to be a father! You're nothing but a beast!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you had just said a single word, I wouldn't have always been humiliated and tormented! But for that, I don't blame you! Your greatest sin is that you personally ordered my mother's execution! You personally killed my mother!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes were intensely bloodshot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, you must die! I swear I will kill you to avenge my mother!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick was utterly shocked at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Obviously, he had never anticipated Osborne's true identity. Now that Osborne revealed it himself, it was hard for him to accept all at once.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he quickly regained his composure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the king of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, his ability to control his emotions far surpassed ordinary people.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He listened to Osborne's words and sneered, "You bastard. I didn't expect you to still be alive! What a surprise! But do you think you can avenge your mother? Ridiculous! Revealing your identity only makes me more determined to kill you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As for your mother, she deserved to die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "You truly have no remorse for what you've done! But that's fine, it means I won't hesitate when I kill you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne turned to look at Callista.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The killing intent in his eyes flared up again as he coldly said, "Queen Callista! Do you remember the time you stopped me and my mother and slapped her hard? Back then, I swore I would take revenge!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In Necropolis City, how did those ten slaps feel?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista's eyes were also filled with killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She gritted her teeth and shouted, "You bastard, I really regret not killing you back then!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's too late for regrets!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered, "In my previous life, all my tragedies started with you slapping my mother! So, you must die too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista laughed loudly and said disdainfully, "You? With your Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, you want to kill me? Impossible! Now, I am already a Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness. The moment the Protective Barrier shatters, I can kill you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You still have the mood to reminisce about your past tragedies here? You deserved it! So did your mother! If I had the chance again, I would make you and your mother suffer even more!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista finished speaking, her face twisted in ferocity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered, "Oh really? Too bad there won't be another chance! There's another reason why I must kill you. Fifty years after my mother was buried, you actually brought people to dig up her tomb, trying to destroy her remains!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even though you didn't succeed, you still deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He finished speaking, and Callista's expression changed instantly. "You even know about this?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered and didn't respond.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He then looked at Weston, Quinn, Naomi, and the others, recounting their past crimes in a tone full of killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, these three also deserve to die!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three were not frightened because they didn't take Osborne seriously at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne is merely at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While Weston is already a Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, Quinn and Naomi are both Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They wouldn't take Osborne seriously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You bastard, you think you can take revenge on us? Ridiculous! The moment the Protective Barrier breaks will be your death!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just wait for your death!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
