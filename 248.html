I think Osborne is also very good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's face turned red, and she couldn't help but laugh in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would be very interesting when Donna found out that the Osborne she knew was the one who defeated the Chevalier family and forced them to flee </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna looked serious when she heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, even if you have a crush on Osborne, you can't lose your judgment! I admit that Osborne is also strong. Even I am not sure I can agree to him now, so he is pretty good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But compared to Mr. Augustine of </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security Services, he is so far behind. </span><span>They are not even on the same level! It is said that Osborne of </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security Services is very likely to be a master of Class A.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's a master!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna looked at him with admiration and said, "If the Osborne I knew also has the strength of a master, I would never stop you from being with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa sneered and said, "You said it, Aunt Donna. I believe Osborne will soon become a master."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna rolled her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're dreaming! It's not that easy to become a master. Many people are stuck at class-B and can't be a master. Osborne wants to become a Grandmaster? No way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa did not refute but continued to choose a dress happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna didn't say much, but just frowned tightly, looked at Clarissa's back, and sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She murmured in her heart, "Clarissa, I hope you won't do anything stupid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>You are the </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span> of the Radcliffe family. Your feelings and your marriage are never decided by you or me! The family has informed that your father has personally gone to </span><span>Dampston</span><span> and will find the best husband for you to marry as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>You and Osborne should break up as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, you will not only harm yourself, but also Osborne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking about it, Donna sighed again, turned and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, in a private house two kilometers away from the Radcliffe Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A beautiful woman, about twenty-six years old, with bright and gentle eyes, was standing in front of the window, observing the situation at the Radcliffe Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a strange figure appeared behind her and knelt on one knee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Medusa, I have news to report!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa slowly turned around and said calmly, "Tell me, what's the news?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Medusa, tomorrow at noon, the Ashford family and the Caldwell family of </span><span>Mayby</span><span> City have booked the Rose Castle and will hold a grand wedding there. According to the current news, Clarissa, the </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span> of the Radcliffe family, will leave the Radcliffe Manor to attend the wedding."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Medusa heard this, there was a surprising light appeared in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a sudden crackling sound where she was looking at, and the branches and leaves that were originally shaking suddenly became stiff, as if they were petrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is she finally leaving here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa sneered and said, "You failed to assassinate a young lady from an ancient family so many times. Now, I even have to do it myself. If I fail again, I will be too ashamed to go back and see the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We originally wanted to take action tonight, but since she's leaving tomorrow, let's change the plan! Immediately have our people disguise themselves and enter the major forces under our control, and let them sneak into the wedding as guests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will kill her myself at the wedding!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Fatebearer</span><span>! If we kill her, I don't know if fate power will backfire. But I don't have time to think about this. This is the last chance the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> has given us. If the assassination fails again, I will give up the assassination mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> we must succeed this time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this coldly, Medusa sneered and turned away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, in Isa's Institute of Human Research.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa was in the backyard, guiding Zoe to exercise her body and strengthen her mental strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, Isa seemed a little distracted. She kept looking towards Osborne's room, with an expression of surprise and shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What on earth is he doing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a powerful energy fluctuation! How did he grow so fast? If this continues, I may cannot compete with him soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This energy fluctuation makes me feel threatened."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa murmured in her heart, wanting to push open Osborne's door to see what he was doing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, she stopped herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because she could feel that the terrible energy fluctuations were very unstable, which meant that Osborne's current state was not stable. If he was disturbed, something bad might happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope you're okay!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you die like this, I will be very disappointed. I have placed all my hopes on you. Please don't die so early!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked extremely solemn. During this period of time, he locked himself in the room. He first integrated elemental essence into Devil's Light, and successfully upgraded the yellow magic light of level three to level four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, without hesitation, he immediately integrated elemental essence into Devil's Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, he ran into trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a big trouble!</span></p><div class="pagination">
