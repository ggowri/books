  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne stepped onto the arena, he faced off against Leona, the fifth-ranked fighter from Azure Haven Academy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Currently sitting at the tenth spot on the leaderboard, Leona was a formidable opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne managed to defeat her, she would drop to eleventh place, allowing Jamar, who was ranked just behind her, to break into the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go, Osborne!" Jamar shouted from the </span><span>sidelines,</span><span> his voice filled with encouragement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he was confident in Osborne's abilities, a knot of anxiety twisted in his stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This match was crucial for his own chances of making the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Getting into the top ten meant securing at least a thousand Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>, which could be exchanged for Sacred Crystals at any sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was equivalent to a thousand Sacred Crystals, a small fortune that could significantly impact Jamar's training and resources for the next decade as he aimed for Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just breathe, Jamar!" Bethan chimed in, her demeanor much calmer since she had already won three matches and secured her place in the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trust in Osborne's skills. Sure, he might not win the championship, but there's no way Leona can take him down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar finally relaxed a bit at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the crowd from Azure Haven Academy erupted in cheers for Leona, hoping she would emerge victorious against Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leona, however, remained composed. Deep down, she understood that defeating Osborne was nearly impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night before, the higher-ups at Azure Haven Academy had instructed her not to focus on winning against Osborne. Instead, her goal was to last as long as possible, draining Osborne's energy in the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I can do this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leona pumped herself up as she unleashed her divine power, layering defenses around herself in preparation for the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but let out a smug smirk at her attempts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You seriously think you can tire me out? You've got your work cut out for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the referee signaled the start of the match, Osborne didn't miss a beat. He quickly strung an arrow on his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow and infused it with Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The audience fell dead silent. Their eyes were fixed on the arena, and the air was thick with tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sacred Power-charged arrow shot forward, zipping towards Leona in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leona's face registered shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Engaging Osborne in combat showed just how impossible it was to dodge his arrows. She'd steeled herself, but it was all in vain&mdash;there was no escaping it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All she could do was prepare for the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even with all her defensive measures, the arrow pierced through her divine-power barriers as if they were tissue paper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leona was sent flying through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood spurted from her lips, and despair was written all over her ashen face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gulf in their abilities was mind-boggling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't even managed to sap a bit of Osborne's strength; one single arrow had been enough to take her out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I gave it my all... but it just wasn't good enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne wins!" the referee announced, and the crowd broke into a flurry of excited chatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leona lost! She couldn't even block a single arrow! That's seriously scary! Who was saying Osborne only won because he bribed Clara and Tyson? He's got the chops to prove himself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne's still undefeated&mdash;could he actually take home the championship?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone retorted, "Not a chance! His next opponents are Pero, Marreese, and Leroy! I don't see him keeping this winning streak going!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The championship is definitely Leroy's!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who knows? Marreese might take him down before Leroy even gets a chance to step in!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's wait and see!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne paid little mind to the buzzing crowd as he returned to his seat, readying himself for the next match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't long before the next battle was announced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, Azure Haven Academy wasn't keen on giving him much of a breather; they aimed to wear him down with a series of matches, hoping to let their stronger contenders&mdash;Pero, Marreese, and Leroy&mdash;take him out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, Osborne made quick work of his opponent, defeating them with a single arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though his adversary was already a confirmed top-ten contender in this city duel, they were no match for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne wins!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd reacted with a mix of awe and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next match&mdash;Mystic Sirius Sect's Osborne against Azure Haven Academy's Pero!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The announcement sent a wave of excitement through the audience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pero, the third-ranked disciple of Azure Haven Academy and last year's city duel bronze medalist, was stepping into the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Pero had slipped to sixth place this time due to the emergence of dark horses like Osborne, Leroy, and Clara, his prowess was undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pero! Take down Osborne! Don't let him into the top three!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go, Pero!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had three matches left to fight, and even if he lost all of them, he was assured a top-five ranking. However, slipping out of the top three was not what he wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every Azure Haven Academy supporter was rallying behind Pero, hoping he could stop Osborne from breaking into the top three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other hand, the fans of the Mystic Sirius Sect were whooping it up for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been a century since a disciple from their sect had reached the top three, and this seemed like their golden opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being a small group, they roared their support for Osborne, their voices resounding through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, Osborne! Beat him and snag that top-three </span><span>finish</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The honor of the Mystic Sirius Sect is in your hands!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've </span><span>gotta</span><span> win!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The roar of the crowd didn't rattle Osborne or Pero as they faced off in the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pero's eyes blazed with determination, spurred on by a feeling of unfairness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The higher-ups at Azure Haven Academy had told him to focus on wearing Osborne down, which meant they didn't think he could win </span><span>outright</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That really rankled him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But thinking of the solemn expressions of the academy's leaders, Pero steeled his resolve. "Osborne, you won't get past me! I'm </span><span>gonna</span><span> knock you out and reclaim my place in the top five!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a soft chuckle. "Really? You're likely to end up disappointed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's delay, Osborne raised his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pero's face instantly registered alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd witnessed the havoc Osborne's arrows had wrought in the previous matches. Apart from Tyson, who'd managed to push back Osborne's arrow once, everyone else had either surrendered or been taken out with a single shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's marksmanship was truly terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pero was well aware that victory hinged on preventing Osborne from </span><span>releasing</span><span> an arrow. Without hesitation, he sprang into action, his figure blurring as he materialized right beside Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lightning-infused sword aimed to get in close on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Going for close-range combat?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar watched from the sidelines, a sly smile spreading across his face. Only they knew that Osborne's prowess went far beyond just archery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Does Pero really think he can restrict Osborne's abilities with a melee attack? He is daydreaming!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was just as fearsome in close-range combat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He balled his fist and threw a punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A pained wail rang out as Pero was sent soaring through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body contorted in mid-flight before slamming hard onto the arena floor. He lay there, unable to get up for quite a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne wins!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this win, Osborne had punched his ticket to the top three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were only two more battles standing between him and the championship!</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
