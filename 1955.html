  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne opened his eyes, a brilliant light bursting forth from them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression was one of sheer astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The effects of the Spatial Gold Crystal were nothing short of astounding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After reaching Level Nine with his space elemental essence, using a blue Miracle Elixir had only yielded minimal results. To make even a small leap in power, he would need to invest a significant amount of time and a hefty supply of blue Miracle Elixirs. But success was never guaranteed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet now, with just a single Spatial Gold Crystal, his space elemental essence had soared two small levels, landing him solidly in the late stage of Level Nine. The effect was truly remarkable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "No wonder the Creation Herald was willing to trade 50 thousand Miracle Elixirs for this! He must have thought I was clueless, trying to pull a fast one on me! Its effects are next-level. Even if someone offered me 100 thousand Miracle Elixirs, I wouldn't trade it for anything. Not a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is everything from Umbra World this terrifying?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, the Bloodstrike Orb, which can heavily injure even an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King, and now the Spatial Gold Crystal...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oh, right! The Creation Herald also mentioned that there are plenty of other treasures from Umbra World scattered throughout deep space. Many super warriors have spent hundreds or even thousands of years searching for these treasures..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes sparkled with excitement. "Since I still have a bit of time, why not go on a treasure hunt myself? With my space elemental essence boosted to the late stage of Level Nine, I'll be much safer in deep space! Plus, with Satan's Eye, my efficiency in finding treasures will be off the charts compared to others!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought was tantalizing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But deep space still harbors plenty of hidden dangers for me right now. I can't go in person, so I'll send my Spatial Clones to scout for me! With the boost to my space elemental essence, my Spatial Clones will be stronger and more than capable of handling the task!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting a moment, Osborne created 100 Spatial Clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Spatial Clone had reached Level Seven, allowing him to create a maximum of 128. Osborne decided to keep 28 in reserve for emergencies while sending the remaining 100 into deep space to search for treasures from Umbra World.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if these clones were lost, he wouldn't mind. He could always create more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go! Bring back everything valuable you can find!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne commanded, and the 100 Spatial Clones shot off into the void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each clone was imbued with a fragment of his soul power, perfectly attuned to his will. They could utilize his space elemental essence and Satan's Eye, making them nearly as powerful as Osborne himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most people wouldn't even be able to tell they were clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they departed, the clones immediately dispersed, each heading in a different direction to begin their search.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For others, the chaotic space currents of deep space were perilous, even for high-ranking Supernal Deity Kings who had to tread carefully to avoid getting lost forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Osborne's Spatial Clones, these dangers were mere trifles. They plunged into the turbulent currents without hesitation, their normal operating procedure. With the aid of Satan's Eye, they quickly began to scour vast areas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, deep space was vast, and searching was akin to finding a needle in a haystack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After three full days of relentless searching, Osborne's 100 Spatial Clones returned empty-handed. One clone, unfortunately, encountered an exceptionally powerful space current. Even with the might of a late-stage Level Nine space elemental essence, it was utterly crushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed and created another Spatial Clone to continue the search.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For nine consecutive days, Osborne's 100 Spatial Clones scoured a vast area, yet they still came up empty-handed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne reassured himself, "Don't rush it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With treasures from Umbra World being this powerful, how could they be easy to find?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Creation Herald mentioned that many super warriors have searched deep space for hundreds or even thousands of years, often without finding a thing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze drifted forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The massive Tree Heart, now nearly fully absorbed by Primordial, had shrunk down to a glowing orb about 10 thousand yards in diameter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within that orb, Primordial had grown into a towering tree, now over 10 thousand yards tall, gently swaying as if it were alive. Its vibrant green hue shimmered like a precious gem, radiating a dazzling emerald-green light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial was now far more powerful than before!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne's attention quickly shifted away from the tree and landed on a colossal eye not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the Infinite Devouring Eyes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the current state of the Infinite Devouring Eyes made Osborne's lips twitch involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had grown even larger, now towering over Primordial by a bit, stretching close to 20 thousand yards in length.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bizarre eye, 20 thousand yards long!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past few days, the massive Infinite Devouring Eyes had driven Primordial nearly to madness. Initially, it had only absorbed the Crimson Energy from the Tree Heart, but once it had drained all that energy, blood-red patterns began to swirl within its pupil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then it turned aggressive, vying with Primordial for the Tree Heart's energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A significant portion of the Tree Heart's energy was siphoned off by the Infinite Devouring Eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial, unable to tolerate this any longer, lashed out with its roots, trying to drive the Infinite Devouring Eyes away from the Tree Heart's orb. But to Primordial and Osborne's shock, something unexpected happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's roots struck the Infinite Devouring Eyes with all their might, but it was utterly ineffective!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with what Osborne perceived as a full-force strike comparable to that of an Ascension One or Ascension Two Supernal Deity King, the Infinite Devouring Eyes remained unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It completely ignored Primordial's attacks and continued to ravenously consume the Tree Heart's energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustrated, Primordial had no choice but to abandon its offensive attack and instead focus on competing for the energy with the Infinite Devouring Eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Primordial was more attuned to the energy of the Tree Heart, ultimately absorbing about 70 percent of it, while the Infinite Devouring Eyes managed to snatch away the remaining 30 percent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, Primordial was on the verge of losing its mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, the once-massive Tree Heart orb had shrunk to less than 10 thousand yards in size and was about to be fully absorbed by Primordial. Losing interest, the Infinite Devouring Eyes returned to Osborne's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at the gigantic Infinite Devouring Eyes, a mix of shock and curiosity washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A 20-thousand-yard-wide eye!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crimson patterns swirling in its pupil sent chills down his spine with just a glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This thing is turning into a monster!" he thought to himself, unable to suppress his unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, Osborne could now control the Infinite Devouring Eyes again, so he quickly began to examine its transformations.</span></p><div class="pagination">
