  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We greet Mr. Augustine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A throng of black-clad figures saluted in unison, their voices resonating in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood frozen, the scene before him reminiscent of a past encounter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recalled the day he had walked the streets in utter disgrace after being humiliated by Ophelia's bodyguards following their divorce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a fleet of luxury cars had pulled up, and a crowd of people had emerged, announcing that the Godfather wanted to see him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That moment had marked his first meeting with the Godfather, a pivotal turning point in his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the scale of this gathering was no less grand - six helicopters hovered above, and dozens of men in black shouted, "Mr. Augustine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could they be from the Godfather?" Osborne pondered, but he quickly dismissed the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze settled on the middle-aged man stepping forward, clearly waiting to explain this unexpected spectacle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, not far away, Ophelia, Evelyn, and the entire Caldwell family stood in shock, their mouths agape in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "These people are saluting Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mr. Augustine?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What on earth is happening?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At last, the middle-aged man reached Osborne, his eyes scanning Osborne's face. A flicker of disappointment crossed his features, but he masked it well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He exclaimed, his voice thick with emotion, "Osborne, I have finally found you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These years must have been hard on you. It's all my fault for not protecting you as I should have, allowing you to wander for over two decades. But at last, I've located you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am your father Allen Augustine's brother - your uncle. My name is Brian Augustine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know the Augustine family from Dampston? We are an ancient lineage, and your father was the last head of the Augustine family. You are the child who was lost to us. Over twenty years ago, your father suffered an accident and lost you, but he has been searching for you all this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just recently, your father passed away. On his deathbed, he entrusted me with a mission - to find you and bring you back to the Augustine family, where you belong. You are meant to inherit his position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that I've found you, you are the heir to the Augustine family! You are the young master!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, come home with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Brian finished speaking, he subtly gestured toward Osborne, who suddenly grasped the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "So, these are the people from the Augustine family in Dampston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given their stature, this kind of reception isn't surprising. But to meet them like this is certainly unexpected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather wants me to become the heir of the Augustine family, but how do I go about it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, it all makes sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'll step into this role as Allen's long-lost son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Allen was the head, naturally, I'll be his successor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This entire setup is orchestrated by the Godfather, designed to shield my true identity while facilitating my entrance into the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian is merely playing his part in this elaborate act."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Understanding this, Osborne had no intention of exposing Brian's ruse. Instead, he decided to play along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, Uncle," Osborne said, his tone calm and respectful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian beamed, clapping a hand on Osborne's shoulder. "Good, good boy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's head back to Dampston! You're now the heir, and soon enough, you'll be the head of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, the Augustine family will be in your hands!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he squeezed Osborne's shoulder tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could feel a slight tremor in Brian's grip, as if he was genuinely invested in this moment, his face alight with a hopeful anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Is Brian looking forward to me changing the course of the Augustine family's destiny?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mind drifted to the fifth trial of inheritance he had faced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family had seen better days. Once a name that carried weight, it was now a shadow of its former self. The Godfather, however, had faith in Osborne, believing he was the linchpin needed to uncover the traitors within and lead the family back to prominence, aiming to put them back in the top three of Dampston's esteemed old families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How the Godfather managed to convince Brian was anyone's guess, but Brian had evidently decided that Osborne was the hope the Augustine family so desperately needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a determined nod, Osborne said, "Alright, Brian, let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne stepped forward, flanked by Brian and a crowd of Augustine family members, making their way towards a sleek helicopter waiting just a few feet away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the helicopter roared to life and lifted into the sky, its blades whirring overhead, Osborne's eyes remained trained firmly ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't spare a glance back at Ophelia and Evelyn, who stood frozen, their expressions a mix of disbelief and shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia murmured, still grappling with the whirlwind revelation, "What... How is this even possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne... He's, unbelievably, the son of the last head of the Augustine family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And now he's the heir? The heir to an old family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's eyes widened, a thousand thoughts racing through her mind, each more </span><span>bewildering than the last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn, too, was in a daze, but beneath it all, a flicker of happiness stirred for Osborne's newfound identity, one that she couldn't help but feel excited about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "So, you really do have quite the legacy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>You're the heir of the Augustine family! Congratulations! No one will bully you anymore, right? Truly, congrats!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she absorbed the implications, her eyes began to shimmer with unshed tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She inhaled deeply and turned to Ophelia. "Ophelia, you need to get a grip! You and Osborne are done. No matter who he is now, it doesn't concern us anymore, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ophelia remained lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took what felt like an eternity before she suddenly slapped Evelyn's hand away, her anger flaring. "This is all your fault! If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have divorced him! Osborne is the heir to the Augustine family! He could become the patriarch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's your fault! If you hadn't meddled, I wouldn't be a divorced woman right now! I could be the wife of the heir!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all on you! All of it! This is all your fault!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the floodgates opened once more, and Ophelia crumbled under the weight of her emotions.</span></p><div class="pagination">
