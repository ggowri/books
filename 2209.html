  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Orb of Reincarnation?" Osborne gawked at the gem gently held in Isa's hands, his face a picture of confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel some strange energy coming off the orb&mdash;the same kind of energy he'd felt from Clarissa before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That energy was her fate power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was something off about the orb; the energy it gave off seemed way more powerful than what he'd sensed from Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a Sacred Artifact!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's words hit Osborne like a ton of bricks, and his face turned to one of pure disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Sacred Artifact?! You sure about that?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded with a smile on her face. "No doubt! That's what your past </span><span>self told</span><span> me. In your last life, you had some hidden injuries that wouldn't heal, no matter what. You had to find these special Sacred Elixirs to get better, so you were always taking off into deep space to look for '</span><span>em</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too bad you just didn't have the luck. You never found those elixirs, so the injuries stuck around. But hey, on the plus side, you did manage to find this Orb of Reincarnation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The value of a Sacred Artifact? It's way above and beyond a Sacred Elixir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Isa talked, the Orb of Reincarnation floated smoothly over to Osborne and stopped right in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued, "Thanks to this orb, you got the guts to come up with those bold plans! It's what let you come back from reincarnation so fast, and that's why your cultivation and breakthroughs have been a piece of cake this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And the reason you bumped into us so soon after you came back? Yup, it's all because of the Orb of Reincarnation! As for how it actually works, I'm not completely in the know. But this orb has been melded with your soul for ages, so you're the only one who can use its power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All I do know is that the Orb of Reincarnation can mess with the cycle of rebirth. The rest will become clear once you get those memories back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was floored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It can mess with reincarnation? So, me coming back from the cycle so </span><span style="font-style: italic;">quickly</span><span style="font-style: italic;">, my cultivation going so well, and meeting Clarissa and the others so soon... it's all because of this Orb of Reincarnation?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached out and his fingers just barely touched the orb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right away, he felt this sense of </span><span>deja</span><span>-vu, like the Orb of Reincarnation was a part of him, something that could never be taken away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Orb of Reincarnation is really mine!" Osborne muttered to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, he felt there was some kind of memory container inside the orb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew right then&mdash;these were the God of Night's memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Memories from his past life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and stole a </span><span>glance</span><span> at the girls. The encouragement in their eyes gave him the push he needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No more second-guessing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He plopped down, crossing his legs. "I'm all set to get those memories!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the words left his mouth, he quickly reached for the memory vessel inside the Orb of Reincarnation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bam! In a flash, a flood of information rushed into his head. It felt so darn familiar that he didn't even have to lift a finger. In his mind's eye, like a movie playing, vivid scenes started to unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flood of memories began with the wailing of a hungry infant, a sound that echoed the vulnerability of his earliest days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It then carried him through the dark times of his youth, filled with oppression and humiliation that left deep emotional scars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, Osborne was thrust into the painful solitude of being exiled from his homeland and landing on </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, there was a glimmer of light when he met Clarissa, Anita, and the other orphans. He took them under his wing, teaching them with patience and care, creating a new family in a foreign land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The search for Sacred Elixirs to mend his ailing body was a relentless journey, marked by countless hardships and setbacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as Osborne was starting to build a semblance of a life, Lord Malevolence arrived, throwing the Human Community into peril. Without a moment's hesitation, he made the resolute choice to stand up and protect them, putting his own life on the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tragedy struck hard when Clarissa, Emma, and Austin were forced into the cycle of reincarnation. The heart-wrenching loss left him devastated, with only Anita remaining by his side as a constant reminder of what he had lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then came the encounter with Isa, and Osborne took her as his disciple, seeing in her the potential to carry on his teachings and values.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, as a sense of foreboding grew with the impending breakthrough of Lord Malevolence, he made a fateful decision. He would tap into the power of the Orb of Reincarnation, not only to find Clarissa, Emma, and the others in the cycle of reincarnation but also to finally resolve the lingering injuries that had plagued him for so long. As each memory washed over his consciousness, weaving together the intricate tapestry of his past, Osborne felt an unshakable connection to the God of Night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, it was as if he </span><span>were</span><span> living through an entire lifetime all over again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The events of his past life unfurled before his inner eye, sharp and detailed, and they </span><span>melded seamlessly with his very core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in the corners of his eyes and trickled down his cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured, a wave of realization crashing over him, "So, this is who I truly am.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is how I spent my previous life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not from </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet at all..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the memories of his past life became one with his being, Osborne grasped a multitude of truths, which firmly cemented his identity. He came to understand that he was the God of Night, and the God of Night was none other than himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fears that he might turn into someone else never materialized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The merging of the memories didn't give rise to another consciousness within him; instead, it simply bestowed upon him a clearer and more profound understanding of himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remained Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, he was also the God of Night!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But ultimately, there was no denying that he was Osborne through and through!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The experiences of his past life were precisely that&mdash;things of the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life, he was Osborne, and those memories wouldn't alter his true self.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only change he sensed was an abrupt weight of responsibility settling on his shoulders, the burden of unfinished business from his past life now bearing down upon him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, he discovered the truth about his identity in that bygone life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His name had once been Osborne Augustine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't used that name since setting foot on </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet, but it was still rightfully his. He originated from the Racial Convergence Planet, a prince of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, the mightiest empire in that world!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among a royal lineage brimming with princes, he was just one of the many.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had shown remarkable talent from a young age&mdash;not the most powerful of them all, but surely among the elite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne's mother's low status as a palace maid meant he was frequently harassed and shamed within the royal family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other princes and princesses regarded his existence as a blemish on the noble bloodline of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, convinced that his mother's position had sullied their heritage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Consequently, he found himself constantly in the crosshairs of others, facing hostility and opposition wherever he went.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne became more and more reclusive, throwing himself whole-heartedly into cultivation. He was driven by the conviction that only by growing stronger could he attain a higher status and win his father's respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed that if he climbed high enough on the social ladder, his mother's status would also be elevated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne trained with unwavering determination, surpassing everyone else in terms of effort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His arduous labor finally paid off. In a royal sparring competition, he defeated his peers and started to stand out in the royal family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, rather than bringing a turn for the better in Osborne's life, this victory signaled the start of an even bleaker period.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other princes and princesses saw him as a menace. The bullying intensified and evolved into devious plots against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he reached the pinnacle as an Ascension Nine Supernal Deity King, the hostility reached its peak, leading to a savage assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That fateful night, pandemonium broke out in the palace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was ambushed and severely injured!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a cruel irony, all the evidence pointed to his mother as the mastermind behind the turmoil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew it was a set-up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, she was executed, innocent but wrongly condemned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how desperately Osborne pleaded, his heartless father showed no leniency. Right before Osborne's eyes, he ordered his mother's death without a shred of remorse. And he himself was banished from the palace and exiled from the Glorious Divine Kingdom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart turned to stone towards his father when the latter cut off all connections with him. The king issued a decree, strictly forbidding Osborne from ever setting foot back in the Glorious Divine Kingdom or even staying on the Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Defying this edict would mean certain death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, under the scornful looks of countless onlookers, he embarked on a journey through the vast starry expanse. Driven by a seething hatred and overwhelming sorrow, Osborne made his way to the lush and green world called </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet.</span></p><div class="pagination">
