  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Yulissa's excited exclamation, everyone's attention snapped to Osborne hovering in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, a wave of exhilaration swept through the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather had arrived!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, that jubilation quickly gave way to a sobering reality. Osborne's presence, while inspiring, was just one person against an overwhelming tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were still encircled by six hundred Class S warriors, with nearly a hundred hidden assassins lurking in the shadows, barely visible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What could Osborne do to change the dire situation they found themselves in?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Wesson, Bryce, and Greyson held no illusions that Osborne's arrival would shift the balance. To them, it seemed like adding another body to the grave rather than a victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair hung heavily in the air, sinking deep into their hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with keen perception, Osborne suddenly fixed his gaze in one direction, his expression chilling in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eityreia Organization assassins! You're asking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a blink, Osborne vanished, moving with the speed of thought itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, on the left flank of the Augustine family, an assassin emerged from the shadows, brandishing a divine artifact dagger aimed straight for the heart of a Class AAA warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cruel smile twisted his lips as he thought to himself, "This is my third kill today; it's going to be just as easy! I'll strike and vanish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With lethal precision, the dagger's point was just inches from its target. The Class AAA warrior seemed frozen, unable to react, overwhelmed by the superiority of this Class S assassin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before the assassin could savor his imminent victory, Osborne appeared before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's icy glare sent a ripple of dread through the assassin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, fueled by instinct, the assassin swiftly redirected his dagger and launched it at Osborne's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne laughed coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fool! You're asking for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, he seized the assassin's wrist, gripping it with a vice-like hold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go!" the assassin screamed, unleashing every ounce of strength in a desperate bid to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne's grip was unyielding, grounded in a formidable power that rendered the assassin's struggles futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic crossed the assassin's face as he realized he was outmatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperately, he brandished another dagger and aimed it at his own wrist, intent on severing it to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne declared menacingly. "Bold move! But too bad for you, you won't be getting away! Die here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Osborne launched a powerful kick directly into the assassin's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the top-tier Class S warriors, Gerardo and Armstrong, couldn't withstand Osborne's might. How could this average Class S contender hope to fare any better?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer force of the impact sent shockwaves through the assassin's body, shattering his lower half in a gruesome display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahhh!" The scream pierced the air but was quickly snuffed out, replaced by an eerie silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like that, a Class S Eityreia Organization assassin lay dead at Osborne's feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shock was palpable among the onlookers; they stood frozen in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Osborne's didn't stop here. His mental strength was still finely tuned, sensing more assassins lurking nearby, one of whom was set on targeting Emma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of murderous intent washed over Osborne as he zeroed in on her. Without a second thought, Osborne vanished again, reappearing right before Emma just as another assassin was about to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kicked the hidden assassin hard, determined to keep her safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The assassin's body erupted in a gruesome display, half of it exploding into a mist of crimson as he was revealed from his cloaked position&mdash;already lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization hit the Augustine family like a thunderclap; they hadn't even noticed there was an assassin targeting Emma until now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa!" A wave of hushed gasps rippled through the crowd, followed by a crescendo of loud murmurs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did Osborne just take out another one? Another hidden Class S assassin? With another kick?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stunned expressions adorned the faces of the Augustine family members. Those who had initially thought that Osborne's arrival wouldn't change their dire predicament suddenly found a spark of hope igniting within them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their cheeks flushed with excitement as adrenaline surged through their veins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eityreia Organization assassins, if you're here to meet your end, then I'm happy to oblige!" Osborne's voice dripped with menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With cold determination, he reached into the Dimensional Space, retrieving the Goddess of Grain's scythe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had relinquished most of his divine artifacts to the Blood Demon Vanguard, but he still clung to the Thundergod Gloves, the Volt Hammer, and this haunting scythe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he gripped the weapon, a vicious glint danced in his eyes. He swiftly scanned the surroundings, pinpointing the hidden assassins lurking in the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with ruthless intent, he acted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's speed was nothing short of breathtaking; he closed the distance to one of the assassins in an instant. The assassin was still cloaked and utterly oblivious to the danger now stalking him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time he sensed the threat, it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Goddess of Grain's scythe sang through the air as Osborne swung it with deadly precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time seemed to freeze for a heartbeat before the assassin's head sailed through the air, a fountain of blood spraying upwards, painting the scene in vivid scarlet.</span></p><div class="pagination">
