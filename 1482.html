  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I officially announce the second appointment within Spark of Blaze&mdash;Darren will serve as our vice leader, working alongside Betty to assist in managing our group. When I'm not around, his orders will carry the same weight as mine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's proclamation left Darren momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mere fact that Osborne had invited him&mdash;a so-called "broken" warrior&mdash;into Spark of Blaze was astounding enough. But now, he was being appointed as the vice leader!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that instant, Darren felt a tremor ripple through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could see from Osborne's earnest expression that the leader truly didn't see him as worthless but instead believed he had something valuable to contribute to Spark of Blaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sense of recognition surged within Darren's chest, making his heart race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had once been a Deity Overlord warrior!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he accept being labeled as a has-been? He longed for acknowledgment, for a chance to prove himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Darren looked at Osborne, a fierce emotion ignited in him&mdash;the kind that made a warrior willing to lay down their life for someone who truly understood them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With sincerity, he bowed deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can trust me, Mr. Lachlan Swift. I, Darren Pollitt, will give it my all to help Spark of Blaze! As long as I'm alive, nothing will happen to our group!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a spark of determination lit up in Darren's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, feeling satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He genuinely didn't view Darren and the others as broken; he saw them as treasures waiting to be uncovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because he believed he could eventually heal them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To everyone else, Darren and his comrades were utterly finished, a lost cause unless the Goddess of Life were to return. Their divine powers were shattered, and their Divine Bodies were broken. Recovery seemed impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne was confident he could restore them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why? Because he possessed the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This legendary artifact could even revive the dead. It could bring back those whose Divine Bodies were utterly crushed, whose souls had been annihilated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Healing Darren and the others wouldn't be difficult at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity fully blossomed, Osborne would use its power to restore them completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When that day came, their regained strength would make Spark of Blaze an indomitable force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Darren was a Deity Overlord warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, many among the five thousand were Transcendent Deity or Celestial Deity level themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the healing of Darren's group, Spark of Blaze would rapidly become a major power capable of establishing a strong foothold in Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They might even surpass the Swift family, currently the most powerful faction within the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity wasn't fully restored yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its roots and stems had healed, but the leaves hadn't unfurled, and the petals had yet to bloom. Until then, Darren and the others couldn't be healed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If not for this, Osborne would have loved to heal them right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he wouldn't have to worry about Fabian, the Deity Overlord warrior, who was waiting outside the slave market for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about Fabian made Osborne frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Darren and asked, "So, Mr. Pollitt, just how strong is a Deity Overlord warrior? Do you think our people in Spark of Blaze stand a chance against one in a straight-up fight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he asked, Betty and the others turned their attention to Darren as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They understood why Osborne was asking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After witnessing how he had angered and offended the Deity Overlord warrior, Fabian, at the previous auction, they were curious to know just how powerful a Deity Overlord really was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Spark of Blaze to establish a foothold in Wild Flame City, they would inevitably have to confront the threat of Deity Overlord warriors from various other factions. Fabian was the first hurdle they needed to overcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just how strong was Fabian?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a question only Darren, a former Deity Overlord warrior himself, could answer genuinely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren was sharp; he understood why Osborne had asked the question. The nascent Spark of Blaze was about to face serious danger from Deity Overlord warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression turned grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deity Overlord warriors are incredibly powerful! I won't talk about the elite among them&mdash;there's a staggering gap even among those who share the same title. Just the weakest Deity Overlord would be beyond what Spark of Blaze can handle head-on right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes swept over Betty and her sisters, a tinge of regret crossing his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry if I'm being blunt, but I'm just being honest. If we were to face a Deity Overlord warrior today, aside from Betty and her sisters, who might manage to survive a single attack, everyone else would be like insects before a giant&mdash;easily crushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even the weakest Deity Overlord warrior, if allowed to unleash their full power without restraint, could wipe Wild Flame City off the map! A radius of 30 miles&mdash;or even 300 miles&mdash;could become a desolate wasteland in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, most Deity Overlord warriors wouldn't do that since they know that true power comes from control and focus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But the bottom line is this&mdash;right now, the members of Spark of Blaze wouldn't stand a chance against any Deity Overlord warrior&mdash;they'd be slaughtered without breaking a sweat! Capturing us alive might be a bit more challenging, but honestly, it wouldn't be that difficult for them."</span></p><div class="pagination">
