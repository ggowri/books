  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The idea that Kendra had taken down a master at Class A with a single move was almost too much to process.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though Vincent was considered one of the weaker AAA ranks and was unlikely to make it onto the Godson Rankings, he still possessed significant power.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For Kendra to challenge him meant her strength had to be at least Class AA or even AAA.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was shocked.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he had misjudged Kendra, it seemed Caleb had too.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Seriously, she's been hiding her real abilities all this time? She even got caught by pirates and made a fool of me?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No wonder Bryce wasn't worried. She's clearly a powerhouse," Osborne thought, feeling astonished.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He quickly asked, "What happened next?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb's expression grew troubled. "Kendra and Yulissa arrived at Challenge Peak earlier today, specifically about an hour ago.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But when Vincent showed up, they had vanished without a trace.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We've combed through Challenge Peak thoroughly, but there's no sign of them. The security cameras caught them entering Arena One but nothing after that.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The footage shows them entering Arena Number One and then disappearing. Since we've hit a dead end, I had to reach out to you.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's face darkened with frustration.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Two people just disappearing like that? I don't believe it! I'm going in to see for myself."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He charged into Challenge Peak.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, he arrived at Arena Number One, the largest arena on the peak, sprawling over a couple of miles. The vastness of the place was overwhelming.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's gaze zeroed in on Vincent.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent was flanked by a group of smug followers, watching with scorn as Nathan, Kaden, and Queenie searched desperately.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One of Vincent's men sneered, "Cut the act!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Kendra must be regretting her challenge now, but she's too proud to admit it. She's probably hiding somewhere!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She actually thought she could take on Vincent?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Unbelievable!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nathan and the others seethed with anger, their fists clenched, ready to explode.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nathan's voice was thunderous with fury. "You're talking nonsense!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if we can't win, we'd never surrender! You're the ones who must be worried that Kendra will beat Vincent, so you must've hidden her and Yulissa!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hand them over now!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yulissa is Osborne's sister. How dare you lay a finger on her? When Osborne shows up, you're all done for!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd erupted in laughter at his outburst.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne? What a joke!" one of Vincent's followers scoffed. "He's only the top heir because he got lucky with a powerful girlfriend!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's nothing but a coward hiding behind a woman!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In front of Vincent, he's just a lowly branch family member. Even if he shows up, Vincent will put him in his place!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man sneered with a smug expression.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh really?" A cold voice cut through the mockery.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You think I'm just a joke?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone turned to see Osborne standing there, his expression as icy as a winter's night.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nathan and his allies looked relieved. "Osborne, you're finally here!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne nodded at them, noting the injuries on their bodies, which made his expression even colder.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stared at the speaker and said, "Now that I'm here, why don't you repeat what you just said?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a slow, deliberate movement, Osborne took out the emblem of the Augustine family's top heir and affixed it to his chest.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man's confident facade faltered, his face turning pale with a hint of panic.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Vincent stepped forward, his gaze filled with disdain.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne," Vincent said, his tone dripping with condescension, "you're the top heir of the Augustine family, destined to lead. Surely you're not going to make things difficult for your own kin over a few words?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent's eyes gleamed with challenge.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's expression hardened. "Vincent, I'm speaking to him. Who do you think you are to interrupt? If I recall correctly, you didn't even make the top three during the heir selection. Right now, you're just another member of the Augustine family. Do you really think you're in a position to talk to me like that?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent's face reddened with anger.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, do you want to die? Just because you're the top heir doesn't mean you can be arrogant! If it weren't for my injury, the top spot would be mine!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In my eyes, you're nothing!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you're a real man, then fight me. If you lose, you'll step down from your position as the top heir!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Otherwise, you'll always be just a weakling hiding behind a woman's skirt.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You don't deserve to be the Augustine family's top heir!"</p><div class="pagination">
