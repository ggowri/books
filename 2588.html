  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne guessed that the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom would definitely manipulate the drawing results again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fact was just as he had guessed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under Osborne's Satan's Eye, he personally saw Zorro secretly tampering and manipulating the drawing results.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The upcoming battles, who would face whom, had already been arranged in advance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought about it but ultimately chose not to stop or change it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To him, it didn&rsquo;t matter who he drew as an opponent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt there was no need to fight Seraphina now. Defeating her at this moment might completely crush the other princes and princesses, leaving them without confidence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then let them keep their confidence for now, and shatter it in the end!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile and stepped forward to draw a lot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the drawing results were out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"First match, Princess Seraphina versus Prince Miles!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Second match, Princess Rosalie versus Princess Jasmine!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Third match, Prince Matthew versus Osborne!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fourth match, Prince Sean versus Leroy!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fifth match, Prince Emiliano versus Clara!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the draw results, Osborne couldn't help but let out a cold laugh. It was pretty much as he had predicted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The only thing that surprised him a bit was that he had thought Clara or Leroy would draw Seraphina as their opponent, but they didn't.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne angrily thought to himself, "They arranged for me to face Prince Matthew, ranked third in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings! They didn't choose Emiliano, ranked second, probably because Matthew specializes in close combat."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They saw me using the Bloodwrought Bow and assumed I could only attack from a distance, not skilled in close combat, so they want to use Matthew to exploit my weakness?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How ridiculous! So naive!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't take this seriously at all. However, Clara's opponent, Emiliano, seemed a bit troublesome to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emiliano is ranked second in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had watched his battles before. His strength wasn't as great as Seraphina's, but not far behind either. He felt Clara facing Emiliano would be an extremely tough fight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was uncertain and didn't know if Clara could win.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead, Leroy's opponent, Sean, ranked sixth in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, but Osborne believed Leroy could win because Leroy hadn't shown his full strength yet!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"All in all, this draw result isn't great, but it's not bad either."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne walked off the stage with Clara and Leroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were the third, fourth, and fifth to appear, so it wasn't their turn yet; they could only wait.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"First match, Princess Seraphina versus Prince Miles! Let the battle begin!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The battle on the stage began.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina is ranked first in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, while Miles is ranked eighth. There is a significant gap in their strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Miles didn&rsquo;t give up; after all, as a prince, surrendering would be shameful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a result, he was easily defeated by the furious Seraphina.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Miles had almost no chance to fight back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina smoothly advanced to the top five.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Zorro announced the results, Seraphina stepped down from the stage but didn&rsquo;t return to the Royal Family&rsquo;s viewing stand. Instead, she walked toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said coldly, "Osborne, I'll be waiting for you in the top five! I said I&rsquo;d break your legs, and I will! But I doubt you&rsquo;ll even make it to the top five! After all, you might not even be a match for Matthew!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course, if you can&rsquo;t even handle Matthew, then you&rsquo;re not qualified to be my opponent!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're just a worthless loser!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her tone was full of provocation and disdain. After speaking, she turned and left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne just smiled and ignored it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the second match began, featuring Rosalie, ranked fourth in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, against Jasmine, ranked seventh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The battle between the two drew a lot of attention.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The final result was no surprise&mdash;Rosalie was stronger and steadily defeated Jasmine, becoming the second person to advance to the top five.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, it was Osborne's turn to take the stage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His opponent was Matthew, ranked third in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment the two stepped onto the stage, many in the audience lit up with excitement, fully focused.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's starting, it's starting!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne versus Prince Matthew, ranked third on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings. Will Osborne make it to the top five? We're about to find out!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne making it to the top five? Impossible!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although he defeated Prince Yunus, ranked fifth on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, and did it with just one move, that was only because he happened to counter Prince Yunus!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And now the situation is reversed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Prince Matthew excels at close combat. His speed and reflexes are incredibly fast. As for Osborne, he uses a bow! If Prince Matthew gets close to him, he's doomed. He'll be defeated instantly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Exactly, how could the Royal Family let him make it to the top five?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He's reached his limit!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just wait and see, this will definitely be a one-sided battle! The Royal Family is counting on this fight to restore their dignity and reputation!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd was talking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the stage, Matthew coldly stared at Osborne and directly pulled out a sharp dagger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The dagger was entirely blood-red, emitting an eerie glow, giving off a chilling vibe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This dagger is a Supreme Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The top three in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, Seraphina, Emiliano, and Matthew, all possess the ability to simply wield a Supreme Sacred Artifact. Although it's just basic control, the power unleashed is still significantly stronger than a Legendary Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In previous battles, none of the three had used a Supreme Sacred Artifact because there was no need.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Matthew used his Supreme Sacred Artifact right from the start, clearly intending to go all out and leave Osborne no chance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said coldly, "Forcing me to use my Supreme Sacred Artifact&mdash;Crimson Dagger, you should feel proud of yourself! Being killed by my Crimson Dagger is also your honor!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, take out your bow and arrows!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You have one chance to shoot an arrow. After that, if you can't defeat me, I'll pierce your body with the Crimson Dagger!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Matthew finished speaking, his face was full of arrogance. The Crimson Dagger in his hand emitted a blood-red glow, enveloping him entirely, as if he were a terrifying blood shadow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "Supreme Sacred Artifact? Your cultivation level hasn't even reached Empyrean Sacredness, yet you already possess a Supreme Sacred Artifact. Those strong ones at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection and Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection would be jealous if they saw this!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Matthew's face showed a proud expression upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I am one of the most outstanding princes of the Royal Family. Isn't it normal for me to possess a Supreme Sacred Artifact? How could someone like you possibly understand? Those ordinary Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection and Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection guys aren't qualified to compare with me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and said, "You have a point! Having this Supreme Sacred Artifact in your hands is simply a waste! In this world, it's not always about whose Sacred Artifact is of a higher grade that determines who's stronger!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There's no need to use my Bloodwrought Bow to deal with you! Isn't close combat what you're best at? In that case, I'll defeat you in the field you're most skilled in!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You want close combat? I'll go all the way with you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, a massive scythe appeared in Osborne's hand, Warfare Scythe!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave up using the Bloodwrought Bow. Although he was confident he could defeat Prince Matthew with a single arrow from the Bloodwrought Bow, no matter how fast or reactive he was, it wouldn't matter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even having a Supreme Sacred Artifact wouldn't help him!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne still chose to engage in close combat with Matthew.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Perfect, I can try out my Warfare Blade Technique!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes were filled with confidence.</span></p><div class="pagination">
