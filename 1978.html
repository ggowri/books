  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trying to run away?!" Osborne scoffed, his voice dripping with disdain, but he didn't rush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine's soul, unbound by the constraints of a physical body, moved with astonishing speed&mdash;so fast that even Osborne's spatial power couldn't keep up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recalled how Adolph's soul had traversed billions of miles in mere moments to invade Osborne's Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under normal circumstances, intercepting Icy Nine's fleeing soul was nearly impossible, even for someone with spatial power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Icy Nine's soul would vanish from sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne had no intention of letting him escape so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While conventional methods might fail, he possessed a unique technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was Soul Spark Oblivion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think you can come back for revenge? Ha! You'll leave nothing behind&mdash;neither body nor soul will remain in this world!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne unleashed his soul-based Divine Ascendance Technique toward Icy Nine's fleeing essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Soul Spark Oblivion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Icy Nine's soul had already traveled a considerable distance, he suddenly felt an overwhelming dread wash over him. In an instant, he sensed his soul power being forcibly ignited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" he screamed, terror gripping him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With only his soul remaining, the ignition of his soul power signified utter annihilation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a physical form, Icy Nine couldn't even use other powers to sever the burning essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he could do was watch helplessly as his soul was consumed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scent of death was palpable, and Icy Nine was filled with rage and disbelief. He was an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King, one of the Nine Dark Sovereigns! Though he ranked last among them, he was undeniably one of Celestara's peak warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had even faced the God of Light and lived to tell the tale&mdash;albeit as a mere supporter while his companions did the heavy lifting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here he was, facing death at the hands of a younger opponent whose cultivation level paled in comparison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even his soul couldn't escape!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought gnawed at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how much he resisted, Icy Nine couldn't extinguish the flames engulfing his soul. He could only watch in despair as his essence burned away, piece by piece.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In those final moments of existence, he looked toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood there, his Bloodwrought Bow in hand, coldly gazing back at Icy Nine. In the flickering light of Icy Nine's soul fire, Osborne's handsome features appeared even more stern and aloof.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A shiver ran down Icy Nine's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man, he realized, could very well alter the balance of power in Celestara and thwart the plans of Lord Malevolence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine asked desperately, "Who are you?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me your name before I die! At least let me know who it is that has brought about my end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied calmly, "If you truly want to know, then I'll oblige. My name is Osborne Augustine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine murmured, the realization dawning on him, "Osborne?! I'll remember that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The others of the Nine Dark Sovereigns will avenge me! The esteemed Lord Malevolence will seek retribution! The Dark Deity Legion will crush every Human Community that stands in the way of the esteemed Lord Malevolence...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be waiting for you in hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the last flicker of Icy Nine's soul was extinguished, his voice fading into the void. Everything about him vanished, not even a chance at reincarnation remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Icy Nine fell, Osborne felt a wave of exhaustion wash over him. He had poured nearly all of his strength into taking down that formidable foe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thrill of having defeated an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King surged through him, igniting a sense of triumph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, Icy Nine's true potential had been suppressed by the absolute forbidden zone, meaning he could only unleash the power of an Ascension Four, but that didn't take away from Osborne's pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Nine Dark Sovereigns had dominated Celestara for years, yet here he was, having slain one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, only eight remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just one more left..." Osborne murmured, glancing toward a corner of the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There, a pitiful figure lay sprawled out like a beaten dog, staring at him in despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Trevor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne materialized before Trevor, towering over him with an air of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Y-you're Theodore? Or are you Osborne?!" Trevor stammered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having been used as a shield by Bram against Jethro's self-detonation, Trevor was gravely injured. Though he had taken a white Miracle Elixir, its effects were underwhelming, and he struggled to even stand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, this also meant he had witnessed Osborne's ascent to power firsthand&mdash;how he had defeated Bram, and then utterly obliterated Icy Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terror and hopelessness filled Trevor's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked. "I'm both Theodore and Osborne! Theodore is just a name I go by."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor was taken aback. "So, the one I trapped with my Universe-Sealing Formation was you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Yeah, that was a close call for me! You were the one who almost got me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regret washed over Trevor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "How could it have changed so fast? Just months ago, I nearly cornered Osborne, pushing him to the brink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it hadn't been for the Hudson family breaking my Universe-Sealing Formation, I might have killed Osborne then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, a mere few months later, Osborne has easily defeated both the Ascension Four Supernal Deity King Bram and the Ascension Five Supernal Deity King Icy Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And here I am, an Ascension One Supernal Deity King, feeling utterly outclassed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor looked at Osborne, knowing that there was no escape. Gritting his teeth, he spat, "A talent like you shouldn't even exist in this world! If I have to die, I'll make sure you don't get off easy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Self-detonation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Osborne's amusement, Trevor chose to self-destruct.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately for him, as an Ascension One Supernal Deity King, he was far too weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he blew himself up, it wouldn't touch Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't even bother to move, standing there calmly as Trevor detonated beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deafening roar, Trevor was obliterated, leaving nothing but a massive crater in his wake&mdash;a mere testament to his existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the dust settled, Osborne remained unscathed, the violent explosion having done nothing to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all over," he said to himself, quickly sealing away the memories of Trevor, Bram, and Icy Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, "I'll look into this later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For now, it's time to head back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I need to resurrect Grandpa soon; otherwise, Uncle Zachary and the others are going to start worrying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne sprang into action, ready to return.</span></p><div class="pagination">
