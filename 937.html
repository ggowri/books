  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing three Class S clones and fifty Class AAA clones, Osborne felt no fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, he charged into the fray, his figure appearing right in the heart of the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Light Realm!" Osborne shouted, unleashing his Level Four Light Realm, enveloping everyone within its radiant grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his opponents had been three ordinary Class S warriors, he wouldn't have dared to deploy such a powerful technique so recklessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the most basic Class S fighters were among the elite, adept at harnessing the power of their own Realms. Osborne knew that even a well-structured Light Realm could be shattered if they chose to self-destruct their own Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But these clones were different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They lacked the finesse of true Class S fighters; their power was merely a result of their genetic makeup, not the result of rigorous training. They didn't possess the understanding of Realms that a true warrior would have.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why Osborne felt confident in casting his Light Realm over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they could certainly attempt to break through his realm, it would take time&mdash;time enough for Osborne to unleash his fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he launched his assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Destruction Orbs!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Disintegration Rays!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, terrifying beams of light and energy cascaded over the clones. Inside Osborne's Light Realm, the ordinary Class AAA clones stood no chance against his onslaught&mdash;anyone who came into contact with his attacks was met with devastating injury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahhh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chorus of anguished screams erupted as many were caught off guard, their bodies suffering grievous wounds before they even realized what was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three Class S clones, however, quickly recognized the danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne? You're asking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They reacted swiftly, charging toward him. The Medusa Queen, one of the Class S clones, unleashed a terrifying glow from her eyes, petrifying everything in her path. Even the Destruction Orbs and Disintegration Rays were caught in her deadly gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt the surge of martial art aura erupt around him, pushing back against the petrifying force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even so, he couldn't help but feel a chill run down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such powerful petrification!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, when he had faced off against Marlon, Scarlett, and Bradley, he had encountered two Medusa Queens, but they were mere half-formed versions of the one before him now. Their petrifying abilities paled in comparison to this one's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne realized his martial art aura was struggling to hold back the petrification.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, the Wolf King and Tauren King launched their own relentless attacks from different angles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Wolf King's claws slashed through the air, shattering Destruction Orbs and Disintegration Rays with terrifying ease, causing even the Light Realm to tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a powerful attack!" Osborne thought, his face paling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Tauren King was even more formidable. He stood there, completely unfazed, as the beams of light and energy struck him, his dark, leathery hide shimmering with a strange glow that absorbed the impacts, leaving him unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such incredible defense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression tightened with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he realized he had underestimated these Class S clones. The Medusa Queen wielded formidable petrification powers that could affect his very body, while the Wolf King had the raw offensive capabilities to seriously injure him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Tauren King's defense was nothing short of terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The combined might of these three Class S clones pressed down on Osborne with an intensity that far exceeded the pressure he had felt when facing Marlon, Scarlett, and Bradley together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph!" Osborne scoffed, feeling the weight of the challenge but refusing to panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Wolf King's claws came crashing down, he clenched his fists, gathering his strength. With a fierce determination, he threw a punch, ready to meet the challenge head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying surge of power erupted as Osborne shattered the Wolf King's claw attacks with a single punch. The force from his strike continued to ripple through the air, prompting the Wolf King to swing his claws wildly in a desperate attempt to break Osborne's momentum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the Tauren King charged in from behind with reckless abandon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly pivoted, delivering a powerful kick infused with the Deadly Force technique, aiming to take the Tauren King down for good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to his dismay, he soon realized that even his Deadly Force couldn't pierce the thick hide of the Tauren King. While the blow sent the Tauren King staggering backward, it failed to inflict any serious damage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression darkened further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such an incredible defense? Not even Deadly Force can get through?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt the situation was becoming tricky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mastery of the Deadly Force technique was at the proficiency level, yet it remained one of the few advanced martial arts techniques he hadn't perfected to the refined level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason? It was just too difficult to master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Tauren King's defense is tougher than I thought. To overcome it, I'll need to refine Deadly Force to its absolute peak! Otherwise, none of my attacks will make a significant dent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought weighing heavily on his mind, Osborne's brow furrowed in concern.</span></p><div class="pagination">
