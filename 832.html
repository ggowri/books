  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, take heed! Her Solar Realm wields immense power and harbors a formidable offensive might!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The moment Clarissa watched Ebony ensnare Osborne within the blazing aura of the Solar Realm, a cry of concern escaped her lips.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What the hell is a Solar Realm?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll shatter it!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a disdainful snort, Osborne launched a fierce assault. His fist, seemingly innocuous, erupted with devastating force the instant it collided with the Solar Realm.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A cataclysmic explosion erupted, instantly shattering the Solar Realm.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Reeling from her shattered mental strength forced Ebony to spew blood, and her complexion drained to a ghostly pallor. Yet, the pallor of shock overshadowed her pain as she gaped at Osborne in disbelief.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought, "With a mere casual punch, he had annihilated the Solar Realm?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could this be?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before her journey to Rosmandi, Ebony had delved into Osborne's prowess, aware of his triumphs over rivals like Vincent and Matthew in the succession trials of the Augustine family. His triumphs had earned him the title of the family's foremost heir.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, in her estimation, Osborne's strength was trifling.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She believed his ascension was a mere testament to the mediocrity of the Augustine family's younger generation.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thus, she held him in no regard.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if she discovered his realm had transcended from Class AA to Class AAA, her indifference remained unshaken.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She held the conviction that she occupied the 398th position on the Godson Rankings. With the Solar Realm at her command, vanquishing Osborne would be not just possible but trivially easy.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, before she could unleash the full power of the Solar Realm, Osborne had decimated it.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her shock was palpable.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Clarissa stood dumbfounded.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought, "Ebony, who had bested me with the Solar Realm, was now helpless against Osborne's might?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her mind raced.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With the power she wielded, she was confident that Ebony could not best her. However, it was her inaugural foray into the intricate dance of a realm battle. Lacking experience, she hadn't yet considered the strategic necessity of dismantling the Solar Realm as her opening gambit.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Otherwise, Ebony would not have triumphed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You... How did you do that? It's impossible!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony's words stumbled over her shock.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's gaze was icy as he addressed her, "I asked you to release Clarissa, apologize, and leave Rosmandi. By then, I might let you live. Otherwise, no matter who you are, you will not leave here alive."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With deliberate slowness, Osborne approached Ebony.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Panic flared in her eyes. "What do you think you're doing? How dare you! I am the beloved daughter of the Thornberry family! My brother is Marlon Thornberry, and my father is Rumen Thornberry. Moreover, my great-grandfather is Helios Thornberry!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you dare lay a finger on me?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you touch me, you will suffer a gruesome fate! No one can save you!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A cold light flickered in Osborne's eyes.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Indeed, the Thornberry family was formidable, and Helios' fearsome reputation preceded Osborne like a shadow. Yet, this did not imply that Osborne would simply bow to the Thornberry family.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He dedicated himself to rigorous practice, relentlessly striving to enhance both his strength and his standing instead of cowering in the shadows of others. He wanted to live a life marked by boldness and courage!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He pondered, "What of the Thornberry family?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If they dared to provoke me and threaten my beloved Clarissa, they would pay the price."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Resolve hardened in his icy eyes.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne voiced a frigid whisper, "Let me ask you one last time. Will you apologize?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Never!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony retorted coldly, "I have never apologized to anyone in my life! I cannot let her go. She is the woman my brother desires, crucial to his breakthrough to reach Class S. She must come with me to Marcelin and wed my brother!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you know what's good for you, leave..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Ebony could finish, Osborne moved to materialize before her. His palm struck her cheek with a resounding slap.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He slapped her cheek with unerring precision.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps Ebony had never expected Osborne to strike her, or maybe she was simply caught off guard, unable to react. Whatever the reason, in that fleeting moment, she was sent soaring through the air by the force of his blow.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her body twirled through the air before she crashed down with a heavy thud onto the unforgiving ground.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her hair was a disheveled mess. The clear imprint of a slap marked her face. She clutched her cheek, staring up at Osborne with disbelief.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How dare you hit me?" she stammered.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne snorted, "I said, no matter who you are, you will pay the price for your insolence."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony's shock gave way to a fury that ignited her very soul.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll kill you!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her life, no one had ever raised a hand against her, let alone struck her with such force.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her eyes blazed with a murderous light as she lunged at Osborne. Her hands clawed like a wild animal's.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, in the very next heartbeat, Osborne delivered another harsh slap across her face.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong with hitting you?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne sneered, "You harmed Clarissa, and I didn't kill you. That's restraint on my part. If you're harboring any grievances, come at me again!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And if your brother has any complaints, tell him to come here personally. I'll be waiting for him in Newport City.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I await your vengeance."</p><div class="pagination">
