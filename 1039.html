  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face changed. There were at least hundreds of such glass containers in the entire room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That meant that Gerardo was using a special method to refine hundreds of living people into his 'Human Slaves'.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew that he would suffer the same fate next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he did not beg for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because he knew begging wouldn&rsquo;t help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was just hesitating whether to call Isa to help him now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After spending so much time together, Osborne had almost determined that Isa's strength was definitely not Class AAA, let alone just broke through Class S. She was so mysterious that he dared not ask too many questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was sure that as long as he called her name, Isa would appear here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she must have her way to deal with Gerardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo was indeed very powerful, but Osborne felt he was far from being as unfathomable as Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, once he called Isa and asked her for help, Isa would probably be very disappointed in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a man, Osborne did not want his woman to be disappointed in him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he bit his lips and prepared to take another look at the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was waiting for an opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If there was no opportunity, he would call Isa then. After all, life was more important than face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at the figures in the glass containers and asked, "Who are they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo smiled faintly, "Valuable people of course!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He brought Osborne to a glass container and saw a bald man sitting cross-legged in the turbid liquid in the glass container.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed to be a priest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a huge amount of energy fluctuating in his body at this moment. It was Class AAA, but much stronger, even stronger than all the Class AAA warriors Osborne had seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The priest wanted to resist the corrosion of the turbid liquid, but he was unable to do so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pain also appeared on his face at this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know who he is?" Gerardo asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was solemn. He had a guess in his mind but didn't say it out loud. He just looked at Gerardo calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Gerardo smiled and said, "He is Lord!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"On the Godson Rankings, Lord is ranked number one! No, he should be ranked number two now. Because of your sudden appearance, he was pushed to number two!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But he is a super genius. I put a lot of effort into catching him. Even though he is only in Class AAA, the strength he showed shocked me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, he is still a little weaker than you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was extremely solemn, and he took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was Lord!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dominated the Godson Rankings for more than a decade and had never been shaken until recently when he was surpassed by Isa, whose codename was 'Night', and Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord was actually abducted by Gerardo and was going to be made into a Human Slave!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne remembered it correctly, behind Lord was also an extremely powerful superpower, Lord League! Even if it was not as powerful as League of Divine Descent, it was not much worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Gerardo actually dared to kidnap Lord!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Lord League knew about this, Gerardo would definitely suffer terrible revenge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, in addition to Lord, there were probably many other people here who came from different superpowers, and their identities were very big.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "No wonder I've never seen a Human Slave before!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guess Gerardo wouldn't dare to let them leave here easily because once exposed, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> might become the public enemy of all superpowers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, Gerardo sent 300 "Human Slaves" to attack </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>. It seemed that he was no longer trying to keep the secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From that, he knew Gerardo was becoming more and more confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Either he no longer cared about being exposed, and the retaliation from other superpowers, or he was simply a lunatic who did not know the consequences of his own actions!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo might indeed be a madman, but he was definitely not aware of the consequences. Otherwise, he would not have lived to this day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo continued, "The Lord has been in my culture tank of Human Slave for six days, but not only has his consciousness not been enslaved, even his body has not been enslaved! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person who lasted the longest before only had his body enslaved for five days and consciousness enslaved for ten days!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm really looking forward to how many days it will take for your body to be enslaved!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finishing saying that, Gerardo snorted coldly, "Let's go! Let me take you to your own culture tank! The culture tank I prepared for you is more powerful than theirs! It even contains the blood of gods. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After your body is enslaved, it will become even stronger and become the most perfect war machine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Gerardo took Osborne to the deepest part of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here, there was a huge culture tank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This culture tank was three times the size of the other ones, and the liquid inside was not turbid but bright red, just like blood.</span></p><div class="pagination">
