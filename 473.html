  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Are you all scared? Are we just going to do nothing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn's sharp voice cut through the silence, bringing everyone back to attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn's voice was cold. "I know what you're all worried about, but I must remind you, Osborne is still young! His strength is rapidly increasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Twenty days ago, he wasn't even Class A! And now, he's not only killed Alexander, who was known as the top talent in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, but he's also killed Wade, who had already broken through to Class A+!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we do nothing and let him continue to grow, maybe in just a month, his strength will become even more terrifying. By then, killing us might be as easy as lifting a finger for him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What will we do then?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you going to kneel before Osborne? Are you going to submit to Osborne and become his servants?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, if we join forces, we still have a chance to kill him. But after a while, even if we join forces, he will easily slaughter us all, and your families will be wiped out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Shawn finished speaking, everyone fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's faces were highly grave, frightened by Shawn's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Luther family agrees to take action!" At this moment, Yaron, the patriarch of the Luther family, spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just as Mr. Walker said, if we don't act now, with Osborne's growth rate, it won't be long before all of us can be easily eliminated by him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You may be willing to submit to the Augustine family, but the Luther family is not!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Therefore, the Luther family, including myself, will participate in this operation with five Class A metahumans. As long as there's an opportunity, we will immediately take action to kill Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only when he's dead will </span><span>Dampston</span><span> return to its previous state."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, his eyes turned towards the Marion family and the Hawthorne family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Shawn smiled, "All five Class A metahumans of the Walker family, including myself, will also participate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, he glanced at the Marion and Hawthorne families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emery, the head of the Marion family, and Dexter, the head of the Hawthorne family, both had hesitant expressions on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the gaze of Shawn and Yaron, both of them felt uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emery gave a dry laugh. "Since you've all agreed to take action, of course I won't refuse. I just felt it wasn't foolproof enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dexter finally spoke up, "The Hawthorne family also agrees."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that both of them had agreed, a smile appeared on Shawn's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said with a smile, "You've made the right decision! However, your concerns are also normal. Osborne's strength is indeed formidable, and I won't let everyone go to </span><span>their deaths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To ensure that we can kill him, I've already contacted the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>. They've agreed to send powerful individuals to assist us in killing Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, everyone, there's no need to worry at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Shawn finished speaking, everyone's eyes lit up with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Walker, if you had told us earlier that the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> would also help, we wouldn't have hesitated so much! Although Osborne is powerful, in front of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, he's just an ant. The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> can kill him effortlessly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emery's face was full of smiles, and his expression was utterly relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn looked at him, a hint of disdain in the depths of his eyes. He said calmly, "I just wanted to see how determined everyone was to kill Osborne. Since it's been decided, everyone should go back and prepare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, I hope everyone will hold nothing back and go all out to ensure Osborne's demise!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, we'll definitely go all out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clandestine meeting finally concluded, and Emery, Dexter, and the others departed one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yaron of the Luther family, however, remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he and Shawn were alone in the room, Yaron said, "Shawn, what are your intentions? Tell me your true plan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn smiled faintly, "As expected, nothing can be hidden from you. My plan is simple. Osborne must die! Everything hinges on killing Osborne. At the same time, Emery and Dexter, those two wastes of space, can die too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After this operation, we'll join forces and wipe out the Marion family, the Hawthorne family, and the Augustine family together! </span><span>Dampston</span><span> will lose three ancient families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By then, our power will at least double."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yaron raised an eyebrow. "Are you confident?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn sneered, "Of course, I'm confident! This time, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> will send at least two Class A+ experts, completely under my command!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two Class A+ metahumans, plus the ten Class A metahumans from our two families, such a lineup is more than enough to kill Osborne, as well as the Marion family, the Hawthorne family, and the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All we need to do is find the right opportunity to strike."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yaron nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Excellent! I'll have someone keep an eye on Osborne. As soon as an opportunity arises, we'll act immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Yaron also left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne was strolling through the </span><span>Augustine Estate's garden</span><span>, hand-in-hand with Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa clung tightly to Osborne's arm, leaning half her body against his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two had been apart for a month and were now enjoying this rare moment alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whenever anyone from the Augustine family saw them in the distance, they quickly moved out of the way, not wanting to disturb them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa gazed at Osborne's </span><span>profile,</span><span> her face filled with a blissful smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I want to go to sea with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Clarissa said, "You said, no matter how dangerous the future may be, we would face it together!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, you're going to lure them into attacking you, and I have to be there with you."</span></p><div class="pagination">
