  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Clara and Leroy were extremely excited and thrilled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara said excitedly, "Osborne, the effect of the Legendary Dragon Elixir is truly amazing. Although I only managed to absorb three drops, its effect far surpasses a hundred drops of Top-grade Dragon Elixir."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could clearly feel that their auras had become much stronger. If they participated in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel now, although they might not necessarily defeat Seraphina, it would at least be difficult for her to win without going all out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was also happy for their progress.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Dragon Elixir not only enhanced their potential but also fully unleashed it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before taking the Dragon Elixir, their potential, even at Class S, was considered prodigy level but hadn't reached supreme. Now, their potential has definitely broken through to Class SS and is even advancing toward Class SSS.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, they are the most supreme prodigies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, don't get too excited!" Osborne said, "We should head to the Glorious Divine Kingdom's Royal Treasury to exchange Kingdom Duel Scorepoints for some treasures to enhance our strength."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne led the two out of the hotel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, two Royal Family guards, one male and one female, were already waiting outside the door. Their expressions were cold, and their attitude was unfriendly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, Osborne and the other two defeated numerous princes and princesses to become joint champions, causing the Royal Family to lose face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Royal Family guards, they had always been arrogant and demanded respect from everyone they encountered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, this time, they found people around them constantly criticizing them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>People's conversations all revolved around yesterday's Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel and how Osborne, Clara, and Leroy fiercely defeated the princes and princesses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those people wore mocking and sarcastic expressions, which deeply humiliated the guards, so they naturally showed no kindness toward Osborne and the other two.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't care at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Lead the way!" he said calmly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Today, everyone who participated in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel can enter the Royal Treasury to exchange their Kingdom Duel Scorepoints for anything they desire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other contestants in the Empire Hotel were also ready and, led by a group of guards, entered the Palace through the side door.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Except for Osborne, everyone else was stepping into the Glorious Divine Kingdom's Palace for the first time. They all appeared extremely curious, looking around.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only Osborne, gazing at the familiar surroundings, revealed deep disgust in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because this place carried too many painful memories for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this cold Palace, he endured countless pain and anger. He felt no attachment to this place, only endless hatred.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he could, he would destroy this place right now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, this was just his wish.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after, the guards led them to the depths of the Palace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Aiden appeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His gaze swept over everyone and finally rested on Osborne. In just an instant, Osborne caught the cold killing intent in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aiden thought he hid it well, but Osborne noticed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered inwardly, "This old guy actually wants to kill me! I wonder if he'll enter Necropolis City? If he does, I must find a way to get rid of him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lost in thought, Osborne's gaze shifted to the distance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the distance stood a massive rock, its surface covered with intricate patterns that emitted dazzling light and intense energy fluctuations.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne knew this was the entrance to the Royal Treasury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This massive rock was called Skywarden Stone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Skywarden Stone was a Supreme Sacred Artifact, linked to the Palace's formation system. Only with the Skywarden Token could one control the Skywarden Stone to move, revealing the passage to the treasury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, no one could enter the Royal Treasury. Even if several warriors at the Supreme Proto-Imperial Empyrean Sacredness level joined forces, they could hardly shake the Skywarden Stone, let alone break into the treasury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were only two Skywarden Tokens.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One was in Frederick's hand, and the other was in Callista's hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aiden was the person Callista trusted the most.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is everyone here?" Aiden said calmly. "Remember, you only have two hours. After two hours, everyone must leave the Royal Treasury. Even if the Kingdom Duel Scorepoints are not used up, you are not allowed to continue exchanging."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Additionally, the treasures in the Royal Treasury can only be looked at with your eyes, not touched. Each treasure is protected by a formation, which will only be deactivated when triggered with a Kingdom Duel Badge and enough Kingdom Duel Scorepoints are deducted."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If anyone tries to break the formation and seize the treasures in the treasury, don't blame me for not warning you if you're killed by the formation."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if you narrowly escape death, you will lose your exchange eligibility and may even face severe punishment from the Royal Family."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In short, the exchange price for each treasure is clearly marked, no bargaining is needed. If you meet the requirements, you can exchange. If you don't have enough Scorepoints, just give up decisively. To exchange, simply place the Kingdom Duel Badge on the formation covering the treasure. Once the corresponding Scorepoints are deducted, the formation will deactivate, and the treasure will be yours."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, you may enter!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aiden finished speaking and took out a palm-sized, pure white token.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is the Skywarden Token.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Skywarden Token emitted a glow, causing the patterns on the massive Skywarden Stone to light up. Then, the giant stone slowly floated upward, as if weightless, revealing a deep entrance below.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The oil lamps on both sides of the entrance lit up automatically, illuminating a downward sloping passage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, everyone present felt an immense and terrifying aura. It was complex and chaotic, sending chills down their spines.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These auras were all emitted by the Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone exclaimed in shock, "Oh my god, such an immense Sacred Artifact aura! We haven't even entered the treasury, yet we can feel this terrifying presence. Just how many Sacred Artifacts are hidden in this treasury?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aiden smiled faintly and said calmly, "The Royal Treasury contains a total of 1.896 billion Sacred Artifacts. Most of them are low-grade and mid-grade Sacred Artifacts. There are 3.6 million Superior Sacred Artifacts, 280,000 Legendary Sacred Artifacts, and over 10,000 Supreme Sacred Artifacts!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, a trace of pride appeared on Aiden's face, as if all these Sacred Artifacts belonged to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words immediately sparked a wave of exclamations.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh my god, 1.896 billion Sacred Artifacts?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Superior Sacred Artifacts actually number 3.6 million?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Legendary Sacred Artifacts amount to 280,000?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Supreme Sacred Artifacts exceed 10,000?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Except for Osborne, who already knew, everyone present was stunned. Although they expected the Royal Treasury to hold many treasures, they never imagined the quantity would be so astonishing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though most of those present were from First-rate Powers or were prodigies, they couldn't hide their shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many had a glint of greed in their eyes, but remembering that these Sacred Artifacts belonged to the Glorious Divine Kingdom Royal Family, they suppressed their desires.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anyone daring to steal these Sacred Artifacts is courting death!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy were equally shocked. Osborne gently patted their shoulders, bringing them back to their senses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Let's go! Don't just stand there. Hurry inside. We only have two hours to exchange."</span></p><div class="pagination">
