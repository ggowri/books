  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course no problem. Wait for me a moment and contact Austin while you are at it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Osborne walked towards Violet and said something to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, Osborne and Barlyn left the Radcliffe Manor together. Donna and Clarissa watched their backs with peculiar expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That brat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna muttered, "I asked Barlyn to protect you, but all he does is go out drinking and even takes Osborne with him. He is just making things worse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa chuckled, "Aunt Donna, it is okay. Drinking is the only hobby Barlyn has, right? Besides, if something really needs his attention, he would not neglect it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna nodded, "That is true. He might seem unreliable, but he knows his priorities when it matters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa said enviously, "Aunt Donna, I wish I could go out and have fun like Barlyn. I do not want to be cooped up here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna shook her head, "Clarissa, until we figure out why the Aberrants wants to kill you, you need to stay in the manor where it is safe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When will that be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna fell silent. The Radcliffe family had been investigating, but found no clues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's eyes dimmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sighed, "Aunt Donna, I am tired. I am going to rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne and Barlyn quickly met up with Austin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They gathered at a villa not far from the Radcliffe Manor, which belonged to the Montague family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seriously, Mr. Radcliffe, we just drank last night, and now you want to drink again? I just woke up. Are you trying to get me drunk and take advantage of me?" Austin teased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn glared at her. "You think I want to invite you? Besides, who would take advantage of you? Osborne asked me to bring you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin's face lit up with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, that is great! Osborne is so considerate, he did not forget about me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn rolled his eyes. "What is that supposed to mean? When I invite you, it is to get you drunk, but when Osborne invites you, it is considerate?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Austin, you have double standards."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin smirked, "Because Osborne is a good person, and you are not!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn was speechless and decided not to argue. Instead, he excitedly brought out a case of wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The bar's wine last night was no good. Today, we are drinking this. I took it from Clarissa's cellar - thirty-year-old Musigny Grand Cru!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is rare and excellent wine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn eagerly prepared to open the wine. Everyone knew that his only hobby was drinking the finest wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as there was good wine, he could not resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin asked the housekeeper to bring some food and sat down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne casually asked, "Is this wine good? How much does it cost per bottle?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn quickly replied, "Of course it is good! Musigny is one of the top ten wineries in Europe. With my twenty years of drinking experience, this wine ranks in the top five! It is not too expensive, thirty-five thousand dollars per bottle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But wine is always worth its price - the more expensive, the better it tastes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I cannot wait any longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Barlyn was about to open the bottle, Osborne stopped him with a smile. "Is expensive wine really better? Today, we would not drink this. I brought some good wine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you brought good wine? What kind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "I am not very familiar with wine. It was a gift from a friend. He said it is top-tier wine from the Draco Group's winery, called 'Glacium Beauty.'"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne did not start with the most expensive Noble Blue, but took out a six-hundred thousand dollars per bottle Glacium Beauty first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even then, Barlyn was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes widened in disbelief. "Osborne, what did you say? Glacium Beauty? From the Draco Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn's breathing quickened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, "Yes, it is called Glacium Beauty. I do not know if it is real. I will go get it, and you can check."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Osborne went to the car to fetch a bottle of Glacium Beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason he only took one bottle was not because Osborne was being stingy, but because he had other plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn was already anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed the Glacium Beauty and excitedly started examining it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Glacium Beauty!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It really is Glacium Beauty! Only high-ranking officials in the Draco Group can occasionally drink this. It is real!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin saw Barlyn's excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could not help but say, "Barlyn, is it necessary to be so excited? It is just a bottle of wine. You act like it is a priceless treasure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You do not get it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn exclaimed, "To a wine lover, this bottle is more precious than any treasure! It is a top-quality wine you cannot buy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He whispered, "Do you know how much it is worth on the black market?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
