  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ambrose quickly realized that the eight fighters were thoroughly intimidated by Anastasia's display of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The confidence they once had was fading fast. After all, Anastasia was in mid-stage Deity King territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once someone reached the Deity King level, the gaps between the small stages were monumental. Only Ambrose, also a mid-stage Deity King, had any chance of going toe-to-toe with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If the eight of them stepped into the arena, they would likely face the same fate as Orson and his team&mdash;utterly obliterated by Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, they noticed Anastasia turning away, making her way back to where Osborne and the others stood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmm? What's she up to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ambrose raised an eyebrow in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anastasia approached her companions with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm done having my fun! Who wants to take a crack at it? It's your turn now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Excitement sparked in the eyes of those around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After witnessing Anastasia take out Orson's team with a single strike, they had all felt a rush of pride and envy. The visible terror of the hundreds of thousands watching had only made them eager to step in themselves, and now they had their chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They exchanged glances, and Bryce was the first to voice his desire. "I'm in! I've been itching for this moment, but to take on eight of them by myself might be a stretch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He turned to Kendra, seeking backup. "How about you join me? If we team up, we'll be unstoppable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kendra rolled her eyes at her brother. "Bryce, can you tone down the bragging a bit?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite her words, she didn't decline. She didn't feel confident about facing eight opponents alone either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two then looked towards Osborne for approval, who nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Give it a shot! If the other clans don't send in their mid-stage Deity Kings, you'll do just fine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At his words, Bryce's face broke into a wide grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if they call in the mid-stage Deity Kings, my sister and I can take them down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without further ado, Bryce charged into the arena, with Kendra right beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They took center stage, glaring at Ambrose and his group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He bellowed, "Listen up, everyone from you various clans! Who dares to face us?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Vivienne herself said you lot are too weak to even take one of her hits! So, she's passing the baton to us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We're just early-stage Deity Kings, but send up any eight of your fighters! How about that Ambrose fellow? Why don't you step up?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's see how fast I can wipe the floor with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bryce's voice echoed through the arena, and his brazen challenge ignited a wave of anger among the onlookers from various clans, their faces flushed with fury at his audacity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ambrose's fury boiled over. "You're looking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, he prepared to lead his team onto the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But then, the eight-man squad, initially hesitant to enter the fray, saw that Vivienne was no longer the opponent. Instead, they were up against only the early-stage Deity King siblings, Bryce and Kendra. Excitement sparked in their eyes as battle lust returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of them urged, stepping forward, "Ambrose, let us take this one!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"According to the draw, it's our turn now! We're not confident facing a mid-stage like Vivienne&mdash;we wouldn't want to shame our clans. But these two? They're just early Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We can definitely take them down and get some revenge for Orson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ambrose frowned at their eagerness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you sure? They might be early Deity Kings, but if they're willing to step up, they must have something going for them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If we lose again, it won't just be your faces in the mud; it'll be a setback for everyone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The eight fighters exchanged confident glances, nodding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry! We won't lose! We have the numbers&mdash;eight against two. Our cultivation levels are close enough; there's no way we'll come out on the losing side!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just watch us teach them a lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, they confidently surged onto the massive arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The leader of the group turned to Bryce with a sneer. "You pitiful Human Community scum, you think you can act so cocky? I'll smash that arrogant mouth of yours in no time! Let's fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, all eight of them sprang into action, unleashing their full power without holding back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bryce's eyes lit up as he let out a hearty laugh. "Now we're talking! You'll soon find out why I'm so cocky! Let's do this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He charged forward, unarmed, without even relying on his weapons&mdash;the Supreme Malevolence Sword or the Trident of Poseidon. He unleashed a fierce onslaught of fist strikes against the eight opponents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Raging elemental water surged around him, crashing against his foes like monstrous waves, instantly shattering their combined attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The eight fighters' expressions shifted to shock and disbelief as their coordinated assault was obliterated so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How is this even possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They thought, "We're all early-stage Deity Kings, and how could this guy dismantle our full-throttle effort so effortlessly? The gap in power can't be this vast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a cold smile, Bryce replied, "Nothing is impossible! I might be the weakest among the Seven Young Deity Kings, but against you lot, this is a walk in the park! So, just give up already!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
