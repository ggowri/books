  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Clarissa's face flushed with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't fathom such evil in people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always believed that ordinary people should live a carefree life, free and happy, except for the pursuit of money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now she realized that ordinary life was not necessarily beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of the existence of the Hummingbird Gang, they could easily become prey to demons and were utterly powerless to fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's eyes were filled with murderous intent as she glared at Kevin, for he had shattered her illusions of a carefree life for ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded in agreement. "They do deserve to die, and so do many more! Over the years, the order in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> has collapsed, leading to the rampant growth of underground gangs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They are secretly supported by powerful families and ancient clans, committing more and more sins, and now these sins are out in the open! This situation must change!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly felt a bit resentful towards Godfather. Godfather was the underground </span><span>king of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>. As Godfather, he should have integrated the rules of the underworld, making everyone operate within these rules.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Godfather wanted, he could make the underworld less sinful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I were Godfather, I would never let such things happen! Making money is fine, but evil forces like the Hummingbird Gang must be eradicated! If I were Godfather..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was lost in thought when more cars arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were only five cars this time, each a top-tier luxury vehicle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew it was the people from the top-tier Pluto family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than twenty burly men got out of the cars first, fully armed and radiating powerful power fluctuations, clearly indicating they were martial artists or metahumans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They escorted a man in his fifties, walking slowly into the forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing the devastation in the forest and the hundreds of fallen Hummingbird Gang members, the man had an extremely stern expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the head of the Pluto family, Gavin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Pluto, thank God you're here! Save me. He's a powerful metahuman. Save me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin, upon seeing Gavin, immediately called for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin snorted coldly, his face showing no fear as he approached Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He surveyed Osborne and Clarissa, made sure he didn't recognize them, and then his expression relaxed even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said coldly, "I'm here! Release my people and tell me who you are!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne offered a faint, mocking smile. "Who we are is not important. If you insist on knowing, consider us the scourge of evil."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Scourge of evil?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin paused, then burst into laughter, his face a mask of contempt and ridicule.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Scourge of evil? Naive boy, thinking you can stand up for the common folk with a bit of power? Aspire to be a hero?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin sneered, looking at Osborne as if he were a fool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Release my people immediately and surrender. Considering you're a metahuman with some strength, I could offer you a chance to serve the Pluto family and make money for us! Otherwise, you will die a miserable death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained silent at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Pluto family was truly arrogant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He replied coldly, "Gavin, it seems you admit that the Hummingbird Gang is backed by the Pluto family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin sneered, "So what if I do? Do you think you can take on our Pluto family? Do you believe you have the capability?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "You will soon find out if I have that capability."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin's tone turned icy. "It seems you are not prepared to surrender! In that case, die! Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more than twenty heavily armed men beside him sprang into action at the command, their bodies radiating powerful energy fluctuations, surprisingly at least at Class C.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An ordinary person would have no chance against them, and even elite soldiers could only be defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a metahuman could stand against another metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two dozen men launched their attack simultaneously. Gavin wore a cold smirk, waiting for Osborne to be taken down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the next second, his face showed terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, it was not Osborne but Clarissa who struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having learned of the crimes committed by the Hummingbird Gang, Clarissa was already highly furious. Encountering the people of the Pluto family, she could no longer hold back her rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These Class C bodyguards were as weak as infants before the already Class B+ Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the two dozen men were all sent flying backward, spitting blood, with each one's chest caved in, their ribs broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after doing all this, Clarissa still felt it was not enough and glared at Gavin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin looked at her in shock. Realizing she was at least a Class B metahuman, he felt fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Clarissa about to attack him, he shouted quickly, "Stop! You can't hurt me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Hummingbird Gang is not supported by our Pluto family. Its true master is the Luther family! The ancient Luther family! I am just working for the Luther family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you dare to harm me, the Luther family will never let you go! Even if you are Class B metahumans or above, you are nothing in front of the Luther family. They can easily crush you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Gavin finished speaking, Osborne held back Clarissa, who still wanted to attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He laughed knowingly, thinking, "It is indeed the Luther family! The Luther family has finally been exposed!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
