  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the expressions of the other Elf Royal Family members in the Combat Arena turned rather sour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's parting words sparked intense discussions among those who had already chosen to join the other exploration teams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Princess Alfreda's distribution plan is obviously fairer! It benefits us more!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I had known earlier, I would've waited before making my decision. If I weren't already part of a team, I'd definitely join Princess Alfreda's exploration team! That way, I'd have a much better chance of gaining something valuable from Umbra Earth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! I'm starting to regret my decision."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For warriors like them, the ultimate goal was to enter Umbra Earth and obtain as many treasures as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, all the teams had similar distribution plans, so they simply chose the most powerful ones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, after hearing Alfreda's proposal, they felt an overwhelming sense of regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her plan was too tempting! Compared to it, the other teams' plans felt downright exploitative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desmond let out a cold snort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That plan might sound good, but only if they actually find anything in Umbra Earth! Don't forget, Princess Alfreda is a Nature Elf. Given the strength of the Nature Elf Royal Family, they can't afford to assign her a strong guard. Her team is bound to be the weakest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With such a weak team, making it out of Umbra Earth alive would already be a miracle. Finding treasure? That's a joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they can't find anything, then no </span><span>talk</span><span> of distribution."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Desmond finished speaking, many people's expressions changed. Then, they nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's right. You need to find treasure first before you can even think about splitting it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One percent of a million Celestial Crystals is ten thousand Celestial Crystals. And half of that is only five thousand Celestial Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So in the end, the percentage means nothing. What matters is whether they have the strength to find treasure at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Princess Alfreda's plan sounds generous, but it's actually full of problems!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd buzzed with discussion. Many who had been tempted by Alfreda's offer gradually calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, everyone knew that some people would be drawn in regardless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Alfreda had promised that anything someone found on their own would belong to them entirely. That alone was enough to make some warriors take the gamble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, several figures quietly turned away from the Combat Arena and made their way toward Emerald Forest Lodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, inside Emerald Forest Lodge, Osborne and Alfreda had already returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So your big move was offering a fairer distribution plan," Osborne said with a chuckle, giving her a thumbs-up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those who believe in their own skills, who think they can find more treasure in Umbra Earth, won't be able to resist joining your team."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda smirked proudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good idea, right? I am a princess, after all. Of course, my strategies work! Just wait. People will start showing up soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, and the two of them settled in to wait.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the first beams of Mystic Luna's moonlight spilled over Elf City, they finally heard movement outside the lodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone's here at last!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda let out a relieved breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, she had worried that her plan had failed. As time passed with no one arriving, her confidence had started to waver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, hearing the sounds outside, a bright smile spread across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, she didn't rush. She remained patient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far from Emerald Forest Lodge, several figures gathered in the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like we have the same goal, to join Princess Alfreda's exploration team."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A calm, confident voice rang out, accompanied by crackling electricity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young man from the Thunderhorn Clan pulled back his hood, revealing a striking purple horn on his forehead. His gaze fell on a stunning woman beside him, her form flickering as if she were merely a shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She belonged to the Shadow Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside them, a young man from the Frost Clan stepped forward. With each step, frost bloomed over the stone pavement beneath his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind them stood another figure, wrapped head to toe in bandages like a mummy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was an Undead Clan warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all hailed from the World of Racial Convergence, each a renowned genius of their generation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And they knew one another well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Shadow Clan woman, Nell Hinchcliffe, spoke first, her tone indifferent, "Pierce, Killian, Harley... You're all here too. Since we share the same goal, let's not waste time. Princess Alfreda's terms are the best. There's no reason not to join her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Thunderhorn Clan youth, Pierce Glyn, nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at the Frost Clan warrior, Killian Frazier, and the Undead Clan warrior, Harley Guerrero.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shall we go in together?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged glances, then nodded as one. Together, they strode toward Emerald Forest Lodge and knocked on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's voice was calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door swung open, and the four of them stepped inside, their sharp gazes locking onto Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your Highness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They bowed slightly, but their posture held little true respect. Arrogance radiated from them. Each of them carried the confidence of the truly gifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda didn't mind. She simply said, "Introduce yourselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pierce spoke first, "Pierce Glyn, Ascension Five Supernal Deity King. My specialty is Thunder Power. My total score on the Astral Testing Arch was Class A."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nell followed. "Nell Hinchcliffe, Ascension Five Supernal Deity King. I specialize in Dark Power. My Astral Testing Arch score was Class A."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Killian Frazier, Ascension Five Supernal Deity King. My main focus is ice elemental power. My Astral Testing Arch score was Class A."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harley Guerrero, Ascension Five Supernal Deity King. My expertise lies in my physical body and divine power. My specialty is defense. My Astral Testing Arch score was Class A."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they finished, their expressions brimmed with pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's eyes gleamed. She nodded approvingly. "Not bad! You four meet my recruitment standards. I assume you're here to join my exploration team?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was thrilled. Four Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings, each with a Class A rating from the Astral Testing Arch. They weren't at her level, but they were impressive nonetheless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any team would be eager to h</span><span>ave them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, all four of them wanted to join hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That alone made her feel triumphant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, the four warriors exchanged a look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nell spoke first, her tone cold, "Since we're here, we obviously meet your standards. But there's someone here who doesn't."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, her body dissolved into mist. In a blink, she reappeared behind Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A divine dagger glowed in her hand, its tip pressing against his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was laced with disdain. "He's only Ascension One. He has no right to be our companion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Princess, if you get rid of this dead weight, all four of us will join your team."</span></p><div class="pagination">
