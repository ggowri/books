  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath, centering himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of deep space made him uneasy; after all, it was the place where he had nearly met his end at the hands of the World Tree offshoot, trapped for a grueling twenty years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, his spatial power had grown strong enough to enter and exit deep space with ease. Still, Osborne hadn't ventured back there since, sticking to the shallower realms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he prepared to re-enter deep space, memories of his past flooded his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've changed so much since then! Back when I was trapped in deep space, I was just a weak Intermediate Deity. My spatial elemental essence was barely at Level Four. But now, I'm at the peak of Deity King level! I could take on even Ascension One or Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings without breaking a sweat! My spatial elemental essence has reached Level Nine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For me now, deep space is just a backyard&mdash;nothing to be afraid of! It's my domain! Even if I encounter the World Tree offshoot again, I won't back down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, confidence radiated from Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He unleashed his spatial energy, enveloping both himself and the Creation Herald. In the blink of an eye, they vanished from their location, appearing in a dazzling world of swirling colors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no sky, no ground&mdash;just an endless expanse of shimmering light and chaotic streams of time and space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was deep space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deep space, here I am again!" Osborne murmured, taking in the familiar surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald glanced at Osborne, a hint of admiration in his voice. "You spatial power users are something else. You make it look so easy to reach deep space! Even I find it challenging to navigate here, and I could easily get lost forever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne detected a note of envy in the Creation Herald's words and couldn't help but feel curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "What's so great about it? It's just a vast emptiness filled with chaotic spatial currents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who in their right mind would want to hang around here for long? It'd drive anyone mad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald seemed to sense Osborne's confusion and asked, "You really don't know much about deep space, do you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned. "What is there to know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald was taken aback. "As a spatial power user, you rarely come to deep space? How did you train your spatial power to reach this level? Was it all just natural talent?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's confusion deepened. "What does training in spatial power have to do with deep space?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald opened his mouth, momentarily speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long pause, he said, "It looks like you genuinely don't understand deep space!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow, realizing he might have overlooked something important.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, enlighten me. I admit I don't know much about deep space."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald pointed in a direction. "Alright, let me explain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll head this way, but keep an eye out for those spatial currents! I'll share what I know as we go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, wrapping both of them in spatial energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chaotic currents of deep space were strong, but to him now, they felt like a gentle breeze by a lake&mdash;nothing to worry about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the Creation Herald's warning, he wouldn't have bothered using any spatial energy at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the Creation Herald began, saying, "The world we inhabit, or rather this entire cosmos, is something even an ordinary person can perceive with their own eyes. We call it&mdash;Vitae World!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vitae World is immense, truly vast! It could be described as boundless; even the mightiest beings cannot traverse every inch of it. Not even those with space elemental powers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded in agreement, feeling the incredible scale of the cosmos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being at the peak of Deity King level, every time he gazed up at the countless stars or into the depths of the seemingly infinite universe, he couldn't help but feel small and insignificant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what does all this have to do with deep space?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curiosity tingling, he remained silent as the Creation Herald elaborated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For most beings, this cosmos feels infinite, akin to a frog in a well looking up at the sky, lamenting its own smallness. But let me tell you a secret: beyond our cosmos lies a realm far more powerful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Strong entities have explored the outer reaches and confirmed that outside Vitae World exists another world, more formidable and advanced&mdash;a place we call Umbra World."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyebrows shot up in surprise. "Umbra World? Is it located within deep space?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald shook his head. "Not at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deep space is still a part of the cosmos; it belongs to Vitae World. Umbra World, however, is entirely disconnected from this cosmos! So, while it's not found in deep space, some powerful beings theorize that deep space serves as a connecting zone between the Vitae World and Umbra World.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think of deep space as a fortress wall, wrapping our cosmos. Cross through it, and you can enter Umbra World. The catch is, nobody has figured out how to breach this 'wall' of deep space yet. We're all stuck within this cosmos!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, confusion swirling in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked, "So deep space is like a wall that encircles the cosmos?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can pass through it to reach Umbra World?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if it really exists, what does it matter to us? We haven't even explored every corner of Vitae World&mdash;who would be daring enough to push through and dive into an unknown Umbra World?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald chuckled coldly in response, "Why wouldn't anyone want to? If you've reached the pinnacle of this world, hit the limits of everything you could experience, and encountered the strength of the Umbra Race, your interest in Umbra World would be piqued! You'd want to step through to find out more!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Umbra Race? What's that?" Osborne asked, his curiosity mounting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald continued, "The Umbra Race comprises beings that have crossed over from Umbra World.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They are a race born of pure power&mdash;each one a prodigy in their own right. The native races that originate in this cosmos can't hold a candle to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's precisely due to the existence of the Umbra Race that we're sure Umbra World is real!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Simply put, if you can cross through deep space, you can enter Umbra World!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
