  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich never expected that Osborne would possess time power, especially given the vast gap in their realms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time around him froze, his mind went blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time he regained his senses, Osborne and his eight Spatial Clones were already upon him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Abyssal Spear! Space Collapse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying attacks crashed into Aldrich before he could react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Malevolence Shield was still recharging, leaving him utterly defenseless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the force of the assault crashed down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Abyssal Spear pierced through Aldrich's chest, while the collapsing space crushed his insides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood poured from his mouth as his complexion turned a ghostly pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't been a mid-stage Deity King with robust vitality, such a grievous injury would have been enough to kill him outright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he was still alive, he felt his strength ebbing away, his legs buckling beneath him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dropped to his knees, unable to hold onto the Supreme Malevolence Sword, which clattered to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock and despair filled his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time! It's time power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do you possess time power?! You're just a Deity Overlord, while I'm a mid-stage Deity King! Yet your time power can affect me! Only the God of Time among the Seven Great Deity Kings could do this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why? Why do you have so many incredible elemental powers? Powers that rival the God of Night's dark power, the God of Space's spatial power, and the God of Time's time power... Why are all these abilities concentrated in you? It's impossible! This can't be happening!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood trickled from the corner of Aldrich's mouth, yet he couldn't hide the shock in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich simply couldn't comprehend the existence of someone like Osborne&mdash;a prodigy of such magnitude that any one of his abilities could forge a remarkable warrior, and yet all of them resided within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was unwilling to accept it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted dismissively and replied, "My time power is nowhere near that of the God of Time! There's no comparison. You were just caught off guard, that's all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so?" Aldrich murmured, his voice barely a whisper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never encountered the God of Time, so he couldn't say for certain, but that was irrelevant now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Osborne, gritting his teeth. "If you survive, you'll certainly become a thorn in the esteemed Lord Malevolence's side! It's a shame I no longer have the strength to kill you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But don't get too cocky. I may not be much, but there are plenty in the Paramount Supreme Clan stronger than me! Many among various clans can take you down! You're far from being a threat to the esteemed Lord Malevolence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be waiting for you in hell!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The esteemed Lord Malevolence won't let you grow! The day he turns his attention to you will be your last! No matter how high your talent or potential, you're doomed! You killed my son, and I'll be waiting for you in hell! Just you wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich's eyes burned with rage, as if he wanted to devour Osborne whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But deep down, he knew he was powerless. The Abyssal Spear had pierced his divine power essence, and there was no way Osborne would let him survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, saying, "Take your time waiting! I'll personally send every last one </span><span>of your</span><span> Paramount Supreme Clan to hell, where</span><span> they</span><span> can all join </span><span>you, </span><span>Aldrich! In the end, even Lord Malevolence will come looking for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne raised the Supreme Malevolence Sword high above his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that those from the Paramount Supreme Clan were protected by Lord Malevolence's energy, making them impossible to convert into Blood Clan members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want to waste any blood essence on them; he was just going to eliminate them directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, Osborne brought the sword crashing down. Aldrich's head flew into the air, blood gushing from the severed neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fire of life in Aldrich's eyes flickered and faded rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly stowed away Aldrich's Dimensional Bag, tucking away the Supreme Malevolence Sword and Shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with a flick of his wrist, he grasped Aldrich's severed head, holding it aloft like a trophy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, eight Spatial Clones vanished, and the surrounding darkness began to recede.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's silhouette, head raised proudly with Aldrich's, emerged slowly as the Eclipse of Eternity he had cast began to dissolve, revealing the outcome of their battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the Eclipse of Eternity, they had fought undiscovered by the outside world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hundreds of onlookers were tense, each holding their breath in anticipation of the result.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of Paramount Supreme Clan warriors stood with calm confidence, their faith unwavering in Aldrich. They were certain Aldrich could conquer Osborne and put an end to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other hand, the Mystic Feather Clan members were in a state of sheer panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe, Kendra, and others were visibly anxious, their eyes darting toward the dark sphere that surrounded the fighters. If it weren't for Anastasia holding them back, they would have stormed into the Eclipse of Eternity to assist Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, as the Eclipse of Eternity faded into nothingness, all eyes turned toward the spectacle being unveiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What they saw stunned them into silence, Osborne stood triumphantly, holding Aldrich's severed head aloft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shockwave of disbelief rippled through the crowd as they struggled to process the scene before them.</span></p><div class="pagination">
