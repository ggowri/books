  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne got five hundred and forty points. He was thrilled with his haul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> had started the war, the six heir-apparent had mostly been retreating. They'd fought a few battles but hadn't gained much ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five hundred and forty points was a huge achievement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least Matthew and Emma, who held the headquarters and engaged in fierce battles with the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, hadn't killed as many Class AA enemies or earned more than five hundred and forty points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne checked his Draco Star Wristlet to review his points. It showed negative 2560.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "It looks like even though I killed all the enemies in the rare metal mine, I didn't secure the area or assign any defenses. So, it doesn't count as capturing it back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, Osborne was satisfied. He decided to go for another strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to cause as much damage as possible to the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' top fighters before they can react. I want to prevent them from expanding their gains. Onward," Osborne said, glancing at his points again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had moved up from last place to second to last, with only Lance behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne planned to repeat his actions at the second rare metal mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, his Draco Star Wristlet vibrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened it and saw a message from the chatroom calling him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew's message was filled with shock: [Osborne, what did you just do? Your points jumped by 540. Did you have a major operation? Did you take down a bunch of enemies, including several Class AA experts?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma was curious as well. She texted: [Osborne, how did you manage that?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen, with a hint of sarcasm, added: [A 540-point increase? Osborne must have taken back a rare metal mine. The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> likely didn't leave many high-level defenders behind, just a few Class A masters.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[With Osborne's strength, killing four Class A masters is doable, netting him 40 points. Add that to the 500 points for reclaiming the mine, and it's exactly 540 points. Too bad he can't hold onto the mine for long. He'll quickly lose 500 points.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Owen's comments, Osborne couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear Owen thought his 540 points were from reclaiming a rare metal mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't bother explaining. He just taunted: [Owen, how did you get so smart? You figured all that out? Impressive.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen sneered and texted: [Osborne, your petty actions are meaningless. If you're alone in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, be careful not to get surrounded by the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>. Don't come asking for my help. I'm not risking my neck to save you.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly and replied: [Don't worry. I won't ask you for help. You should focus on not losing </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> headquarters too easily.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne ignored Owen and closed the chatroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He ripped open another dimensional rift and headed to the second rare metal mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Osborne's advantage became evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using interdimensional travel was not only fast but incredibly stealthy. Even though the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> had taken over </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, they couldn't track Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He soon arrived at the second rare metal mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hid in the shadows and used Satan's Eye to scout the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enemy count was similar to before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the defenders were no longer Werewolves but Medusas, who looked identical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he knew the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> had many identical Medusas, seeing so many together was still surprising.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "Clones? How did the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> manage this? The cloned Medusas have the same abilities and are this strong. If the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> can clone so many Class A and higher Medusas, could they easily sweep the world? Who could stop the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a chill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now was not the time to dwell on it. His goal was to eliminate these Medusas and rack up points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having fought two Medusas before, he knew their tactics. For him, Medusas were easier to handle than Werewolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a Class AA himself, unless there were Class AAA Medusas here, their petrification power couldn't harm him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't believe there are Class AAA Medusas here, " Osborne muttered, beginning his attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still used the dark power along with the Goddess of Grain's scythe for stealthy kills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any lone Medusa had little chance to react before Osborne was close enough to decapitate them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quickly, Osborne took down nine Medusas, including three Class A+ level ones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining six Medusas had gathered together, with three of them emitting noticeably stronger energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were Class AA Medusas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, these three Class AA Medusas were clustered together in the middle, making it impossible for Osborne to strike them without alerting the surrounding Medusas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It looks like I'll have to go in with a full assault." Osborne sheathed the Goddess of Grain's scythe and took out the Death Sickle.</span></p><div class="pagination">
