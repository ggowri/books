  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the past two days, Osborne had thoroughly familiarized himself with Sacred Power, and he now held a clear understanding of its immense potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confidence surged within him, reaching new heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alfreda finally emerged from her meditation, Osborne couldn't help but notice the dramatic shift in her power. Not only had her plant elemental essence broken through to level ten, but her cultivation level had also climbed from Ascension Five to Ascension Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her talent, reaching Ascension Six meant she could probably hold her own against an average Ascension Seven in direct combat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fueled by her newfound strength, Alfreda was equally brimming with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment she finished her retreat, she immediately challenged Osborne, eager to show off just how much stronger she had become. Alfreda wanted him to know that she was now the superior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda called, a broad grin plastered across her face, "Osborne! Let's have it out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not scared of you anymore! Your cultivation level is still Ascension Two, right? Ha! Even if you resort to that special tactic of yours, I'm confident I can take you on! After all, using that trick of yours can only bring me down to Ascension Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And that's more than enough to beat an Ascension Two like you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a playful gesture, she beckoned him closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on! Let's settle this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, watching her with an amused expression, "Is that so? You seem pretty sure of yourself. If I used my absolute forbidden zone to bring your cultivation level down to Ascension Four, you think you'd still have a chance to win?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised her chin defiantly, a look of pride on her face. "Absolutely! I'm a super prodigy with a total score of Class SS on the Astral Testing Arch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter how talented you are&mdash;Celestial Progeny or not&mdash;you're still just an Ascension Two!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can beat an Ascension Four, then I might as well throw myself off a cliff!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle at her fiery spirit, "No need for that! If I win, all I ask is that you recognize me as your leader from now on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just follow my orders and be my subordinate. Deal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda shot him a skeptical glance. "You think I'll play the role of your little follower?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dream on! I'm a princess of the Nature Elf Royal Family! You expect me to bow down to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you afraid? Or do you really think you'll win?" Osborne teased with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her irritation flared, and she retorted, "Who says I'm scared? I'm all in! I can't believe that I'd lose to you now! Even if I faced Uriel, I could hold my own without getting crushed right away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I absolutely refuse to believe I can't handle you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And if I win, you'll have to acknowledge me as your leader!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Alfreda's eyes danced with excitement as she locked her gaze on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then!" Osborne replied without hesitation, fully confident that he wouldn't be the one to lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coincidentally, Alfreda was thinking the same thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The instant she accepted, Alfreda burst into laughter. "Osborne, you've just signed your fate! Get ready because I'm coming at you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, waving a hand dismissively, "I'm ready! Bring your A-game; otherwise, you might not get another chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda raised an eyebrow, taken aback. "Ready? You haven't even unleashed your absolute forbidden zone! I'm still at Ascension Six over here, remember?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne laughed softly again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need to rush into the absolute forbidden zone just yet! I want to see how I measure up against you in a fair fight first. If I find I can't beat you, then I'll pull out the absolute forbidden zone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda was struck silent by his unexpected confidence, her frown deepening as she processed the implications.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? You want to fight me without using your absolute forbidden zone? Are you out of your mind? I'm at Ascension Six, and you're just a measly Ascension Two! Even if your talent rivals that of a Celestial Progeny, there's no way you can hold your own against someone like me! One hit and you'll be done for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda glared at Osborne with a furrowed brow, convinced he had lost his senses and become overly arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Does he really think an Ascension Two like him can take me on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's seeking death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm not your average Ascension Six; a bunch of typical Ascension Six warriors wouldn't stand a chance against me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's got no business trying to take me on without suppressing my cultivation level!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, chuckled, unfazed, "Go ahead and make your move! In the past 10 days, I've seen quite an improvement in my own abilities, so I'm curious to see if I can stand up to you without resorting to the absolute forbidden zone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda frowned again but couldn't help but notice the unshakeable confidence on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a huff, she replied, "Hmph! You're seriously underestimating me, aren't you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, if you're so convinced, I won't try to change your mind. Just remember, when I wipe the floor with you, you'll probably be begging to use your absolute forbidden zone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here I come!" she declared, her expression shifting to one of earnest determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't going to hold back just because Osborne chose not to unleash his full power. She had one goal&mdash;to defeat him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alfreda activated a deadly forbidden technique from the Nature Elf Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Temporal Amber!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she raised her hand, flickering streams of light surged between her fingers, each glow bringing forth ancient elven runes. As the light brightened, a distorted membrane surrounded Osborne, wrapping around him as if he were caught in a cage of shimmering energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, greenish-blue light flared, and Osborne found himself unable to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the divine power within him felt trapped, unable to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face reflected his surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the third time he'd seen Alfreda use her deadly forbidden technique, but this was the first time he truly felt its power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of respect washed over him as he acknowledged, thinking, "Temporal Amber is indeed formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once ensnared, the only way to escape is through special means or if your power level significantly surpasses your opponent's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being trapped like this... it's as if time has sealed me off from my abilities, making me a mere observer of her impending attack. I might very well be about to lose!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, his strength was largely rendered useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda laughed triumphantly. "Got you! Osborne, you've already lost! So from this moment on, you're my sidekick!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now let's hear you call me Ms. Rivera with respect! If you please me, maybe I'll let you go and give you a second shot at me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But let me tell you, next time you'd better bring your absolute forbidden zone; otherwise, you won't stand a chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she saw him trapped, Alfreda's confidence soared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She truly believed she had won this duel. After all, Osborne was only Ascension Two&mdash;there was no way he could slip out of her Temporal Amber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but smile at her enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alfreda, you might be celebrating a little too soon. I'm not out of the game just yet! Your Temporal Amber is indeed a terrifying binding technique; most opponents wouldn't be able to escape it. But the thing is... it won't hold me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that declaration, Osborne summoned his Sacred Power from within, and in an instant, the tendrils of Temporal Amber shattered around him like fragile glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Alfreda knew it, he was free, a smug smile on his face as he locked eyes with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our little spar? It's only just begun!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
