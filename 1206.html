  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce was taken aback by Osborne's proposal. The idea of him leading the Draco Armed Services Branch?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was absurd!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was not an member of Augustine family after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Sebastian, Matthew, and Wesson exchanged surprised glances, clearly taken off guard by Osborne's unexpected invitation to Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce protested, shaking his head vigorously, "No way! I can't do that! I've heard your plans, and I know that the Draco Armed Services Branch is going to grow into a massive organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're talking thousands of members, if not more. If everything goes smoothly, it will become an enormous force. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I'm just an outsider. You'd be better off keeping that power in your own hands. If there's a betrayal down the line, it could backfire on you, and that would be a real mess."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce spoke with genuine sincerity, his concern evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne simply smiled, a calm look on his face. He said, "Mr. Clarkson, I've never seen you as an outsider."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce was momentarily stunned by the compliment, but he bit his lip, unsure of how to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, he envisioned the future of the Draco Armed Services Branch as the most formidable armed force in Rosmandi. Whoever controlled that power would wield immense authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He appreciated Osborne's trust in him, but the thought of leading such a force made him uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce thought to himself, "People can change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Human hearts are the hardest to read.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't even trust myself. Once I have control over the Draco Armed Services Branch, would I really be content to play second fiddle to Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What if my ambitions swell, and I decide to carve out my own path, turning the Draco Armed Services Branch into my own private army?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Bryce was resolute in his refusal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned; he believed Bryce was the best candidate for the role. His strength and talent were undeniable, and his experience as the former leader of Likreia Mountain was invaluable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if Bryce wouldn't accept, there was little Osborne could do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of hesitation, Bryce finally spoke up again, "Osborne, I really appreciate your faith in me! My sister and I have enjoyed our time with the Augustine Estate; it's been a breath of fresh air. I'm more than willing to help you out. But as for leading the Draco Armed Services Branch, that's a no-go&mdash;unless you marry my sister, Kendra. Then I'd be more than happy to step up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the room was stunned into silence, their eyes wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce, however, wore a bright smile, clearly unbothered by the shock he had just delivered. "If you marry Kendra, we'd be family, and I'd have no problem helping you manage the Draco Armed Services Branch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was momentarily speechless, his mind racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but picture Kendra's face. "She's definitely beautiful and cute, but I've never thought about her like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Bryce really suggesting I marry Kendra?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce continued, "Ha! No need to rush into a decision, Osborne. I know you and Kendra aren't quite there yet. But I do know she has feelings for you. If you just say the word, we'd be family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for now, while I can't take the lead, I'd be willing to be a vice-leader. You can choose someone you trust to be the head, and I'll support them wholeheartedly. I promise no issues will arise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, feeling a sense of relief wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce's willingness to be the vice-leader was a win in his book. "If the leader is hands-off, the vice-leader essentially runs the show anyway," he thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sudden idea, Osborne turned to his sister, Anastasia, who was standing nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia, I want you to lead the Draco Armed Services Branch," Osborne declared, his tone firm yet encouraging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia froze, her eyes widening in disbelief. "Me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of hesitation, she took a deep breath and replied, "Okay! If you want me to do it, I'll do it! But I really don't know anything about this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled reassuringly, "If you're unsure, just ask Mr. Clarkson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, Mr. Clarkson will be the first vice-leader of the Draco Armed Services </span><span>Branch. Any matters, big or small, can be directed to him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia beamed, nodding enthusiastically. "Got it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Bryce, she said politely, "Mr. Clarkson, I look forward to your guidance! Together, let's make the Draco Armed Services Branch the most powerful armed force in the world!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce was momentarily speechless, caught off guard by her enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia as the leader?" he thought, glancing at her youthful face, which seemed even younger than his sister's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a twinge of regret for agreeing so quickly, but it was too late to backtrack now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, let's give it our all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, satisfied with how things were shaping up, continued, "Matthew, Mr. Wesson Augustine, Mr. Greyson Lambert, and Zoe, you will all serve as vice-leaders of the Draco Armed Services Branch. Your job is to assist Mr. Clarkson and Anastasia in managing and expanding the organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The survival of the Augustine family in this chaotic world&mdash;and our ability to protect our loved ones&mdash;depends on your efforts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The seriousness of his words hung in the air, and the group nodded in agreement, their faces etched with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the leadership structure of the Draco Armed Services Branch was set in motion, and a new chapter was beginning for all involved.</span></p><div class="pagination">
