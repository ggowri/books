  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As soon as I complete the fifth fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, our bond will strengthen significantly! At that point, the Lotus won't easily abandon me, and the limit on my revivals will increase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, I'll have the freedom to choose where I resurrect! Sure, I can't stray too far, but it's a far cry from being stuck in one spot," Osborne mused, a flicker of hope igniting within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, he sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Divine Body had already ascended to the Level Nine Cosmic Divine Body. Even as a Superior Deity, the strength of his Divine Body was more than enough to support the fifth fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he still had the Breath of Celestial at his disposal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fusion process went smoothly, and Osborne lost track of time as he merged with the Lotus. Soon enough, their connection deepened, and he felt a surge of relief wash over him. He wouldn't have to worry about the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity </span><span>leaving him behind anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, a sense of security enveloped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity is with me, even in this treacherous deep space, I have a chance at survival. I might just need to invest a bit more time in finding my way out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But right now, my top priority is to continue enhancing my space elemental essence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A determined glint sparked in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that blindly searching for an exit in the deep space was futile; otherwise, so many wouldn't have gotten lost in its depths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he wanted to escape, the best approach was to elevate his space elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stronger his spatial power became, the better his chances of surviving in this place, and Osborne could even traverse the deep space with ease, reaching the surface dimension without a hitch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe I need to push my space elemental essence up to Level Seven to navigate the deep space freely and return to the surface easily! Level Seven elemental essence&mdash;now that's a tall order!" Osborne thought, furrowing his brow in concentration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level Seven elemental essence&mdash;now that's a tall order!" Osborne thought, furrowing his brow in concentration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Currently, his space elemental essence stood at Level Six, which was quite formidable even in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>. Many Celestial Deities and even Deity Overlords might not possess such a level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap between Level Six and Level Seven was not just a matter of one rank; it was a chasm of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level Seven elemental essence was likely the domain of a Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suspected that the God of Time could resist the spatial tide precisely because she wielded Level </span><span>Seven time</span><span> elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level Seven elemental essence was extraordinarily powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if it had no direct connection to space, it could withstand the spatial tide and allow for easy escape from its grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, for Osborne to elevate his space elemental essence from Level Six to Level Seven would be no small feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, no matter how daunting the challenge, he had to try.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I still have the core energy of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity! I've extracted nine core energies from it. So far, I've used six on the Satan's Eye, Medusa's Gaze, and on my spatial and dark elemental essences. That leaves me with three!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Can these three core energies elevate my space elemental essence from Level Six to Level Seven?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I guess I'll just have to give it a shot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, I'll be lost in this deep space forever, aging slowly until I wither away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Superior Deity has a long lifespan&mdash;normally, I could live for thousands of years without a hitch. But if I can't find a way out, those thousands of years will slip by in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't want to be trapped here for millennia!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Let's get started! I'm going to pour all my energy into enhancing my space elemental essence. If those three core energies aren't enough, I'll just extract more!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne settled down cross-legged in the depths of the space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne focused intently as he fed a strand of core energy from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity into his space elemental essence. Channeling all his will, he pushed hard for it to absorb and digest the energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The core energy of the Lotus was incredibly potent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its energy level and purity dwarfed that of ordinary worldly powers by leaps and bounds. As the essence embraced this energy, Osborne felt an exhilarating surge; his space elemental essence rapidly ascended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This advancement in his essence granted him increasingly refined control over his spatial power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the essence had fully consumed the first core energy, Osborne sensed a significant shift: his space elemental essence had now reached the mid-Level Six!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A subtle light replaced the suffocating darkness of the deep space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This realization sent waves of exhilaration coursing through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"See? Elevating my space elemental essence is definitely worth it! Once I hit Level Seven, I'll be able to thrive in this deep space and slip away from here in no time!" he thought, his excitement bubbling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the triumph faded slightly when he considered the implications of consuming the first core energy. While it advanced his essence from the early to the mid-Level Six, he couldn't shake a sense of foreboding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this pace, even if he burned through all three remaining core energies from the Lotus, he might only push his essence into the late Level Six&mdash;perhaps even just shy of reaching its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not quite hitting Level Seven, huh? That could be problematic. But I can't give up yet! Gotta </span><span>keep</span><span> pushing for that upgrade!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
