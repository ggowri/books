  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne relentlessly tormented George, unleashing the fury and hatred that had been building inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Light of Redemption at his disposal, George had no chance of dying, no matter how desperately he wished for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only real challenge Osborne faced was the immense toll that maintaining the Light Realm took on his mental strength. Even if he did nothing but keep the Realm active, he could only sustain it for about twenty minutes at a time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, Osborne stumbled upon a loophole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he felt his mental reserves dwindling and was about to stop his torment of George, he cast the Light of Redemption on himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his astonishment, Osborne found his mental strength completely restored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This revelation filled him with exhilaration; Osborne could now continue another twenty minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every three minutes, he used the Light of Redemption, which meant he could inflict another seven cycles of agony on George.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And even if Osborne's mental strength ran low again, he could always recover it with the Light of Redemption.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as the Light Realm held strong, he could wield its power without worrying about the drain on his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This realization brought a wicked grin to Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He resumed his torment of George, determined to fulfill his promise of returning the pain tenfold or even a hundredfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George's screams echoed in the air, but as the minutes dragged on, his cries grew fainter, his eyes becoming vacant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Osborne felt he had sufficiently vented his rage. With one swift motion, he severed George's head from his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph!" Osborne scoffed, a sense of satisfaction washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he quickly shifted gears, contemplating his next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He retrieved the God Binding Rope from his Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Blood Cross' power surging through him, he broke free from the rope's constraints, which now felt like nothing more than a regular piece of rope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he could sense the immense power it still harbored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a top-grade divine artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Goddess of Grain's scythe would struggle to cut it; it would take dozens of strikes to leave a mark, let alone sever it completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne decided to keep the God Binding Rope for himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If used wisely, it could trap even the strongest Class S foes, rendering them powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wild thought crossed his mind, "Could the God Binding Rope be used against Gerardo?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He considered feigning captivity, waiting for Gerardo to appear, and then striking with the rope to ensnare Gerardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the idea was quickly dismissed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought. "Too risky! The God Binding Rope was originally Gerardo's divine artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knows it better than I do&mdash;he could have left a backdoor in it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using it against him would be like signing my own death warrant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it fails, I could end up captured again or, worse, killed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I need to get out of here first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo wants to use me as bait to lure my grandfather into a trap, and I can't let that happen! As long as I'm alive, he can't force my grandfather's hand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that resolve, Osborne prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly freed thirty-five captives from the Draco Armed Services Branch. These individuals were no pushovers; they were Class AAA fighters, but they had been injected with a strange drug that rendered them powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew he couldn't use the Light of Redemption to restore each one individually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he called upon the power of light elemental energy to cleanse their bodies. The healing properties of the light elemental energy worked swiftly, neutralizing the drug in their systems and restoring their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the captives regained their senses, Osborne turned to them, determination shining in his eyes. "Alright, folks, let's get out of here before they come looking for us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he prepared to tear open a rift in space, ready to lead the group to safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he began, a cold dread washed over him. Osborne realized with horror that he couldn't tear through the surrounding space at all. It was as if the air had solidified, impenetrable and steadfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression shifted to one of alarm, a gnawing unease settling in his gut. Gritting his teeth, he barked, "We'll fly back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He braced himself to make the attempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that moment, a scornful snort echoed through the air, and an overwhelming pressure descended upon them, crushing down like an enormous mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All thirty-five of the others, except for Osborne, crumpled to the ground, pinned helplessly. Even Osborne, despite his strength, felt the weight bearing down on him, his legs buckling beneath the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, like a dark cloud descending, Gerardo's towering figure floated from the sky, landing with an air of menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He locked his gaze on Osborne, surprise etched across his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You somehow broke free from the God Binding Rope? Color me impressed! You're the first person I've met who managed to escape its hold after being sealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It looks like your body hides some significant secrets! I'll be sure to examine you closely after I deal with Sebastian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But for now, you'd better just cooperate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a finality in his voice, Gerardo made his move.</span></p><div class="pagination">
