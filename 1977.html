  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine, one of the formidable Nine Dark Sovereigns, proved his terrifying strength as he staggered but refused to fall, even after sustaining grave injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He coughed up a mouthful of blood, but the sight only fueled his resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a swift motion, he poured a vial brimming with life essence into his mouth. Almost instantaneously, his wounds began to heal at a visible pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression shifted, his eyes narrowing in disbelief as he took in the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a cold huff and notched another arrow on his Bloodwrought Bow, his intent clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, "One arrow won't do the trick? Then I'll fire two!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If two aren't enough, I'll shoot three!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to see just how long you can hold out, and how many of those precious healing potions you really have!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Killing intent surged from Osborne; he had already felt Icy Nine's terrifying spatial power from his previous strike, and it only bolstered his confidence that he could take Icy Nine down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!" he yelled, releasing the bowstring once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spatial arrow zipped through the air, appearing before Icy Nine almost instantaneously. Despite being prepared, Icy Nine couldn't evade it this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead of dodging, a wild look ignited in Icy Nine's eyes. He seized Bram with a desperate grip, using him as a shield against the impending attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" Bram gasped, panic flooding his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Already severely injured by Osborne and hindered by the absolute forbidden zone, his Ascension Two power was no match for Icy Nine's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the arrow struck, it pierced through Bram's body with horrific force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The explosion of power sent Bram reeling, blood pouring from his mouth as he felt the life force draining from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confusion and rage flickered in his eyes as he turned to Icy Nine, wanting to speak but finding his voice stolen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine hastily spoke, "Bram! To die for me is an honor! Don't worry, once I escape, I swear I'll avenge you! Rest easy as you face death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce determination painted across his face, Icy Nine slapped Bram hard on the back, sending him tumbling toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Bram flew through the air, his energy surged violently, chaos erupting within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was going to self-destruct.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Bram's self-detonation wasn't voluntary, the sight of it unfolding left a grim impression. Osborne, who had just drawn back his bowstring, preparing to launch another attack against Icy Nine, immediately felt a surge of seriousness wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bram? He's an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King!" he thought, realizing that even if he was weakened by the absolute forbidden zone, his power was still very much alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The explosion to come would carry the force of an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could no longer prioritize Icy Nine; his attention narrowed to the imminent threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Icy Nine raced away, desperately trying to escape the confines of the absolute forbidden zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scoffed, irritation lacing his voice, saying, "You think you can just run away in front of a spatial power user?! Trying to exploit Bram's self-explosion to make a getaway? Not on my watch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne vanished and reappeared right in front of Icy Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of my way!" Icy Nine roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his power having built up, he swung a fierce punch aimed straight at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a cold snort, refusing to dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he swung his own fist with all his might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to match strength? You're in over your head!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment their fists collided, a sickening crack echoed through the air, bone shattering under immense pressure. Icy Nine's agonizing scream pierced the silence as he was brutally overpowered, his arm shattered, and he was sent flying backward by sheer force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Osborne ascended to Supernal Deity King, he had already attained the Infinite Sacred Body and Single Dragon Might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After his breakthrough, his power had multiplied at least tenfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, his physical strength was at least equivalent to Denary Dragon Might, making his strikes nearly on par with an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King's full-force attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To challenge Osborne in a contest of strength was nothing short of suicidal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Icy Nine was propelled back, he found himself right in the path of Bram's impending self-destruction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The explosion from an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King was a force to be reckoned with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Icy Nine, an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King, wouldn't dare take it head-on under normal circumstances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he was suppressed in his cultivation level, and, having just been launched by Osborne's punch, he was caught in the blast radius of Bram's self-detonation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming force engulfed him in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahh!!" Icy Nine's shriek echoed again, but he managed to burst forth from the explosion's reach a split second later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the damage was catastrophic; he emerged looking like a bloodied specter, his body in tatters and his Divine Body on the brink of collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hadn't anticipated this twist of fate&mdash;Bram's self-destruction had inadvertently harmed Icy Nine, igniting a spark of opportunity in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now's my chance! While you're down, I'll take you out for good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasted no time, unleashing his full power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Oblivion Slash! Spatial Clone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty-eight Spatial Clones sprang into existence, rushing toward Icy Nine from every direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simultaneously, a flurry of Dimensional Razors flickered into being around him, ready to unleash their devastating force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Osborne's Level Nine late-stage space elemental essence, his Spatial Oblivion Slash became a terrifying assault. Even though Icy Nine's vitality was robust and he was desperately consuming thick healing potions, he couldn't withstand such a relentless onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flesh and blood were shredded from his body in brutal waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the twenty-eight Spatial Clones closed in, launching their own attacks with precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each clone wielded Osborne's space elemental essence perfectly, and their combined might was enough to inflict serious damage on Icy Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a heartbeat, Icy Nine was overwhelmed by a barrage of strikes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His already crumbling Divine Body could no longer hold up against the relentless assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Icy Nine's Divine Body shattered completely. In the chaos, a wisp of spiritual energy broke free, transforming into a shadowy figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Icy Nine's soul!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a warrior like Icy Nine, even if his physical form was destroyed, his soul could linger for a time, choosing to either enter the cycle of reincarnation or invade another's Soul Current Ocean to seize a new body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his soul surveyed the remnants of his shattered Divine Body, rage coursed through him. He shot a cold glare at Osborne, fury radiating from his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine spat, venom dripping from his words. "Damn it! Just you wait!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will return for revenge! Next time we meet, it'll be you who's dead! Just you wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a final, spiteful glare, Icy Nine's soul darted away into the distance, moving with a speed that was nothing short of terrifying.</span></p><div class="pagination">
