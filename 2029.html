  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the towering structure of Ninefold Heaven's Tower, Icy One listened intently to the reports from the Human Community's spies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smirk crept across his face. "Oh? A thousand Supernal Deity Kings protecting them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems Osborne and his crew aren't as foolish as I thought. They realize that relying solely on God of Light won't cut it, so they've called in some heavy hitters from the major forces of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pulling together a thousand Supernal Deity Kings just for their protection? That's quite the investment! But do they really think that makes them safe? How naive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those who are destined to die will meet their end, no matter the odds!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of his hand, he continued, "We'll need to tweak our plans a bit. Let's move in two hours..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Sanctum of Light, Anastasia, Zoe, and others were deep in meditation at the center of the grand hall, while Osborne stood before the massive doors, studying the intricate carvings that adorned them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surrounding the hall, hidden in the shadows, were a thousand Supernal Deity Kings, standing vigil to protect them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light sat majestically on her Radiant Throne, observing the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne focused intently on the carvings, which depicted a dark figure accompanied by six children&mdash;one boy and five girls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you looking at?" God of Light's voice suddenly broke the silence, startling Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't even noticed she had left her throne and approached him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, just some patterns that seem familiar, but I can't quite place where I've seen them before," he replied, still captivated by the designs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Familiar, you say? Have you been to other Sanctums?" God of Light's surprise was evident. "These patterns only appear in seven specific locations!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seven locations? Which ones?" Osborne asked, curiosity piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light didn't hold back. "Only in the seven great Sanctums of the Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, aren't there only two Sanctums in the Human Community?" Osborne raised an eyebrow, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaking her head, God of Light said, "There may only be two now, but that wasn't always the case! Each of the Seven Great Deity Kings had their own Sanctum!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These Sanctums are a type of Apex divine artifact! We acquired them during our explorations in deep space!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Originally, there were seven Sanctums that could merge into one! The combined power of that fusion would be incredible and fearsome! Unfortunately, a thousand years ago, five of those Sanctums were destroyed by Lord Malevolence..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, God of Light's expression grew somber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The seven Sanctums are the Sanctum of Night, Sanctum of Light, Sanctum of Life, Sanctum of Death, Sanctum of Space, Sanctum of Time, and Sanctum of Destiny!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A millennium ago, when Lord Malevolence descended upon Celestara, his terrifying dark energy engulfed the land, wiping out over ninety percent of the Human Community in an instant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"During that time, the seven of us were exploring deep space... By the time we returned, it was too late to save anything!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our only option was to declare war on Lord Malevolence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Under the leadership of the God of Night, we fought a fierce battle against him for a month. In the end, five of the seven Sanctums were shattered by the Lord Malevolence, and the God of Life was killed in action. We barely managed to inflict serious damage on him and seal him away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In that battle, not only did the God of Life perish, but the God of Space, God of Time, God of Death, and God of Destiny were all gravely wounded&mdash;injuries that may never heal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They could only enter reincarnation after burning through their powers, and to this day, they have yet to return...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps they will never come back at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only I and the God of Night survived with relatively lighter injuries."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As God of Light spoke, a flicker of pain crossed her features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued, "We thought everything was over, that Celestara would slowly recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But then, three hundred years ago, the landscape changed dramatically. Forty-two divine peaks suddenly appeared, followed by the relentless Deathborn army, wreaking havoc and draining the life from everything in their path...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the end, those vile Deathborn found the sealed location of Lord Malevolence and the Dark Deity Legion, shattering the seal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lord Malevolence and the Dark Deity Legion returned!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before we knew it, Celestara was swiftly overrun by the Dark Deity Legion. The Human Community had no choice but to retreat to the West Zone, barely holding on thanks to me and the God of Night."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne listened intently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was somewhat familiar with these tales, but hearing them from the God of Light, who had lived through it all, painted a vivid picture of the chaos and despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured, piecing it all together, "The Human Community's Seven Great Deity Kings! The seven Sanctums!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, the figure in that carving, along with the six children, represents your Seven Great Deity Kings?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And that dark figure... is it the God of Night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light nodded, her expression softening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! You might find this hard to believe, but the God of Life, God of Death, God of Space, God of Time, and God of Destiny&mdash;we were all just ordinary people, or rather, orphans taken in by the God of Night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He saved us! Without him, we might have starved to death. He came to us, took us under his wing, taught us how to cultivate our powers, and helped us unlock our potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was his guidance that led us to become who we are today. The God of Night isn't just our leader; he's our brother, our father figure. He changed our lives!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Without him, we wouldn't exist as we do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes shimmered with warmth and affection as she spoke, a deep love evident in her tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a weight settle on his chest as he processed this revelation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't realized the depth of their bond; they weren't just equals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Night was a mentor, a father, and a guiding light for the other six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is the God of Night now?" Osborne asked, his voice steady but laced with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light shook her head. "This was supposed to be a secret, something I could never reveal to anyone. But for some reason, I feel at ease with you, trust you, and I don't want to hide this from you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The God of Night has been missing for over twenty years!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before he vanished, he came to see me. He said that with the current strength of the Human Community, we couldn't possibly stand against the Paramount Supreme Clan. Even he couldn't defeat Lord Malevolence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, he decided to undertake a highly classified mission. It would be dangerous, fraught with uncertainties, and the odds of success were slim. But to defeat Lord Malevolence and protect the billions of lives in the West Zone from the Dark Deity Legion, he felt he had no choice but to go through with this risky plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He promised that once he returned, everything would come to an end..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
