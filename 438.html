  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Isa, are you finally admitting that I'm your man?" Osborne asked with a playful smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa let out a cold laugh. "I can admit it, but the real question is, can you? I've already told you that if you become my man, I'll kill every woman you like and have you all to myself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, are you my man or not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne awkwardly rubbed his nose and said, "I was just joking. No need to take it so seriously. Let's start now. I feel like I'm in great shape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa coolly replied, "You made me pretty mad just now, so I'm not in the best mood. We'll start later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten minutes later, Isa had calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She led Osborne into a room and had him sit half-naked on her bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bed carried a faint, pleasant fragrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath, inhaling the scent, and Isa's face involuntarily reddened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pretending not to notice, she said seriously, "The process might be painful, but you have to endure it. I believe you can handle it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath. "Don't worry, I'm not afraid of pain. But if I succeed, could you give me a little reward?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa wanted to kick him but held back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked coldly, "What kind of reward do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "If I succeed, I want to hold you and sleep on this bed for one night. Don't get the wrong idea. I promise I won't do anything out of line."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's face turned even redder, filled with both anger and embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought to herself, "How can he be thinking about this at a time like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she took a deep breath and said, "Fine. If you really succeed, I'll let you sleep here for one night."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not just sleep here for one night. I want to hold you while I sleep here!" Osborne corrected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa gritted her teeth and said, "Fine, I get it. No need to remind me! If you keep talking, I might change my mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised his hands in surrender, then mimed zipping his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I'm going to start compressing your soul of powers! Get ready to release it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here? Release my soul of powers? Mine's pretty big, you know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa sneered, "You're just a Class B+ metahuman. How big could your soul of powers be? Just release it. No matter how big it is, I can compress it instantly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought for a moment and then nodded. "Alright!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just do it quickly. I don't want any ordinary people see it. Otherwise, we'll be all over the news."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne began communicating with his soul of powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Typically, metahumans only released their soul of powers when facing mortal danger or during life-or-death battles. The stronger the soul of powers, the harder it was to release.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many Class A Power Masters couldn't even release their soul of powers during intense battles because there was simply no time for that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's soul of powers had already exceeded ninety-nine yards, nearly reaching 100 yards. So, even compared to most Class A Power Masters, his soul of powers was nothing to scoff at and perhaps even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a ninety-nine-yard-tall, humanoid silhouette appeared, its eyes gleaming coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Osborne's soul of powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first time Osborne had ever released his soul of powers voluntarily. The enemies he'd faced were either too weak to require it or too strong, making it useless to release his soul of powers. After all, it might hasten his death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his soul of powers were shattered, he would suffer severe injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get ready. I'm about to release my soul of powers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne warned Isa, but she remained calm and indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, a ninety-nine-yard-tall soul of powers suddenly appeared. Fortunately, it wasn't physical, or it would have torn through the entire mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, the massive soul of powers extended beyond the mansion, with most of its body exposed outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the sheer size of Osborne's soul of powers, she was momentarily in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she quickly recovered and swiftly waved her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt his soul of powers being crushed by an overwhelming force. The ninety-nine-yard-tall soul of powers was instantly compressed to just three yards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simultaneously, an intense pain exploded in Osborne's mind, causing his entire body to tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain was indescribable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Osborne was accustomed to the excruciating pain of absorbing blood diamonds. The pain was just as intense, so he was somewhat used to it and could endure it for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, it took him a full minute to adapt to the pain and begin breathing heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa, seeing he was alright, let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is your soul of powers so big? You're only Class B+, but your soul of powers is bigger than most Class A Power Masters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's face was full of shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne grinned. "I told you. I'm really big!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's face turned red, and she rolled her eyes. "You're still joking at a time like this? It seems you're not in enough pain yet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, get ready. I'm going to continue compressing your soul of powers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the terrifying force pressed down once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's soul of powers, which had been compressed to three yards, shrank by half in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The excruciating pain returned, and Osborne's body began to convulse.</span></p><div class="pagination">
