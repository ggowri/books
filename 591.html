  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everett Rosenthal, the head of the Rosenthal family, a divine family from Yalynch?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Class S Supreme Overlord!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone gasped and finally understood why Everett could sit across from Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Rosenthal family was the most powerful divine family in Yalynch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was a divine family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their own words, they were the descendants of gods, claiming to be both their offspring and their spokespersons in this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Rosenthal family's status in Yalynch was on par with the Augustine family's in Rosmandi and even more formidable. As the royal family, they controlled most of the region's politics, economy, and military.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Rosenthal family was the absolutely dominant family there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lance was from the branch bloodline of the Augustine family of Yalynch. Having grown up there, he was well aware of the Rosenthal family's power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression was extremely solemn. Everett, the legendary powerful man from Yalynch, a Class S Supreme Overlord, and the head of the Rosenthal family, actually came to Rosmandi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lance sensed that something significant was about to unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If two Class S Supreme Overlords had a fight, the Augustine family would definitely be beaten to pieces, and even the entire Newport City would be greatly affected and may even be reduced to ruins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everett, what brings you to Rosmandi?" Godfather asked with a slight frown, tightly grasping the black and gold scepter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett smiled, "Sebastian, I have already mentioned that I came here especially to congratulate you on your 80th birthday. We are all old friends, so there is no need to be so nervous. This is Rosmandi, your territory. I am not crazy and will not do anything reckless here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather chuckled, "That would be the best."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett suddenly changed the subject and said with a grin, "Sebastian, you are a Class S Supreme Overlord and the Godfather of Rosmandi. Your birthday party is a bit underwhelming, isn't it? You didn't invite a few old friends, and there aren't any interesting activities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about I arrange one for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather furrowed his eyebrows, knowing that Everett would soon reveal his true purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He replied calmly, "What is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's very simple."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett explained, "This time, I came to Rosmandi with a few unsuccessful younger members of the Rosenthal family. They are very interested in the strong peers of the Augustine family and are eager to compete with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about letting them fight each other?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're getting older, and eventually, this world will belong to the younger generation. It will benefit both of our families if we allow them to compete and interact more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, the young men and women behind him suddenly glanced arrogantly at the Augustine family with stern expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their provocation immediately aroused the dissatisfaction of Vincent, Matthew, Owen, and Emma, who glared back at them icily and fearlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather asked, "Let the young men fight? It's not impossible. Tell me the details."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett grinned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's quite straightforward! I've brought six young men from the Rosenthal family, all under 35. The Augustine family will also provide six masters of the same age. They'll compete in a round-robin battle. The losers will be eliminated, and the winners will continue to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the end, the side whose people are all eliminated first will lose the game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since there will be a winner and a loser, we naturally need some stakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the Rosenthal family loses, I am willing to give two divine artifacts to the Augustine family. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Everett had finished speaking, everyone in the Augustine family exclaimed in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The bet is actually two divine artifacts! Oh, my goodness! I have never seen a divine artifact before!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine artifacts are incredibly rare, yet the Rosenthal family is willing to wager two pieces! How many divine artifacts do they actually possess?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They are indeed a divine family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are the Rosenthal family really descendants of gods?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the Augustine family wins, won't we have two more divine artifacts?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the Augustine family was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Godfather frowned tightly. "What if we lose? What will the price be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett replied, "The bet must be equal! If the Augustine family loses, you need to provide us with a divine artifact and open up the rare minerals of Rosmandi to the Rosenthal family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather was annoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Augustine family is also staking two divine artifacts in this bet. Do you want us to open up the rare minerals of Rosmandi to you? Dream on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it non-negotiable?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather snorted coldly, "Yes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett beamed immediately. "Okay! Since you are so determined, forget it. Let's bet on two divine artifacts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Six young men and women promptly emerged from behind him, each exuding a powerful aura and brimming with pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They are the six individuals the Rosenthal family will deploy. All are under 35 years old, and their strength is negligible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone from the Augustine family can fight as long as they are under 35 years old."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett cast a glance at Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the Augustine family surveyed the six individuals, but none of them could recognize who they were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Lance grew nervous at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godsons!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They are all Godsons, the younger generation of the Rosenthal family!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
