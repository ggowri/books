  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The five looked at Osborne with worried expressions.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aleena tried to persuade him again, "Are you really not coming with us? We're already 60 miles away from the Williamson Castle, out in the vast ocean. They might not be able to find us here. We could make a safe return to Rosmandi!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne shook his head firmly. "I can't underestimate the power of a Class S Supreme Overlord from the Williamson family. Their capabilities are beyond our imagination.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Go quickly, don't let my efforts be in vain."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aleena gritted her teeth and nodded vigorously. "Alright! We're going!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, she flew towards the direction of Rosmandi.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett, Stuart, and Vivian all gave Osborne a deep look. "Axell, come back safely!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They said in unison before hurriedly departing.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the end, only Emma remained. She bit her lip, hugged Osborne tightly, and bit his lip until it bled.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Come back safely!" Emma whispered before leaving.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne watched as their figures disappeared, then took a deep breath and tore open another dimensional rift, quickly returning to the Williamson Castle.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He walked out of the courtyard and strolled at the castle.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's intention was to let them know that he hadn't left, buying more time for Emma and the others to escape.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He could only hope that this would work.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, the Williamson Castle was much quieter than before. Most of the guests from the various superpowers had already left, leaving only the members of the Williamson family to clean up the messy venue.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they saw Osborne, their eyes immediately filled with anger.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne had destroyed Cuthbert's Honor Quest Ceremony!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert had lost to Osborne, failing to achieve his 50th consecutive victory and being humiliated on the stage with Osborne standing on his head.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For the Williamson family, this Honor Quest Ceremony was not only a failure but also a disgrace.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne had not only destroyed Cuthbert's confidence but also the hope of the Williamson family.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could they not hate Osborne?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmmph!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, a group of young men and women from the Williamson family surrounded Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They stared angrily at him, and one of them sneered, saying, "Axell, you're still here? What are you doing? Are you showing off your power?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The only reason you could defeat Cuthbert is that he was too exhausted and not at his peak. If it were a fair fight, Cuthbert would easily beat you to death!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled faintly at their words.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that so? Unfortunately, the winner is me, not Cuthbert. He lost, and no amount of talking will change that fact."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're asking for it!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd from the Williamson family grew even more furious. A man stepped forward and declared, "Osborne, I challenge you! Let's have a fair fight. I'll avenge Cuthbert's defeat!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne looked at him with surprise.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This man was Abner Williamson, the second most powerful among the younger generation of the Williamson family. He ranked 320th on the Godson Rankings.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at Osborne provocatively. "Axell, dare you accept my challenge? A formal fight without any rules!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne raised an eyebrow at his words.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "My purpose here is to buy time for Emma and the others. Since these young members of the Williamson family are provoking me, why not play with them and attract the attention of the entire Williamson family?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that in mind, he smiled and replied, "You want to challenge me? It's not impossible, but what's in it for me? I don't do anything without a good reason. If you want to challenge me, you'll have to put up some stakes, at least."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Abner's expression instantly turned to one of deep conflict.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment of tense silence, he finally gritted his teeth and said, "What stakes are you suggesting?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled, "You're one of the strongest of the younger generation in the Williamson family, second only to Cuthbert. Since you're daring enough to challenge me, and you've made it clear that it's a no-rules fight, I'm guessing you've got a divine artifact on you, right?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Abner's face paled, and he opened his mouth to respond, but Osborne cut him off.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You don't have to deny it. It's just my deduction. If you didn't have a divine artifact, you wouldn't stand a chance against my Light Realm, let alone challenge me.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So here's the deal: if you lose, everything you're carrying becomes my spoils. How does that sound?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Abner snorted but didn't refute the terms.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And if you lose?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne shrugged nonchalantly. "If I lose, I'll forgo the 500 billion in prize money."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Abner hesitated for a moment, then nodded with confidence.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Deal! The arena's still set up, so let's settle this there.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll show you that your victory over Cuthbert was just luck. Normally, I'd be enough to take you down without Cuthbert even needing to lift a finger."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Abner strode toward the arena.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's smile remained unchanged as he followed Abner to the stage, where they faced each other.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without hesitation, Abner drew a divine artifact sword from his side.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's get this fight started!"</p><div class="pagination">
