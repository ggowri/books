  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin ceased his relentless assault, a smirk curling his lips into a cold sneer.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In his mind, he had gauged Osborne's capabilities. Osborne was formidable but not enough to stand among the elite, those near-mythical figures on the Godson Rankings who could challenge an S-class Supreme Overlord.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To Marvin, Osborne posed no real threat.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By now, Osborne's bones were nearly all shattered by Marvin's attacks. The swallow shield that had been his bastion was flickering, its power waning, no longer able to shield him from harm.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin mused silently, "Soon, I would end Osborne with ease."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I recall you possess a technique for swift recovery. Use it. I'll grant you the chance to reach your zenith before I strike again. I want no excuses when you fall."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a nod, Osborne responded, "As you wish!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Light of Redemption!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He invoked the Light of Redemption, instantly healing all his wounds and restoring his condition to its zenith.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a flourish, he drew his super energy pistol, an act that sparked surprise in Marvin's eyes.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne wore a serene smile, "Your son, Cuthbert, was felled by this very pistol."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At his words, Marvin's expression iced over.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He sensed that Osborne was toying with him. His son, Cuthbert, was a top-tier AAA-class warrior. The notion that Cuthbert could be killed by a mere pistol was ludicrous to Marvin.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You don't believe me?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's smile was slight, almost pitying. "You will."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After his declaration, Osborne inhaled deeply, channeling his strength with wild abandon into the super energy pistol. Having just restored his power to its peak, he now unleashed it without reservation, pouring every ounce into the weapon.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The air buzzed with tension!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Divine Bone Crystal embedded in the weapon thrummed with violent energy, awakening the latent divine power within.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ultimately, half of the divine power contained within the Divine Bone Crystal was ignited into action, representing the absolute peak of Osborne's power.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crystal, having been utilized on multiple occasions, now had half of its divine power activated. It suddenly emitted a crackling noise, teetering on the brink of disintegration.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A divine power bullet, imbued with terrifying divine power, was now ready.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin frowned.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"An energy weapon?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So what if you have this? I've encountered numerous energy weapons. At best, it can only slightly amplify your energy. But the chasm between us is vast. Even if your energy were magnified three or fivefold, you'd still be incapable of harming me!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin remained brimming with confidence.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that so?" Osborne remained calm. "Then feel it for yourself."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He pulled the trigger.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The divine power bullet tore through the air at a speed that defied perception, closing in on Marvin, who now sensed the true peril.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No! This isn't just amplified strength!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This power&hellip;</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is divine power?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn it!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin let out a roar, but it was too late for evasion. He instantaneously unleashed his strength, sending out concentric circles of shockwaves in a desperate bid to dissipate the force of the divine power bullet.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately for him, the energy level of the divine power bullet surpassed even his formidable strength!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instantly, the divine power bullet struck Marvin. Osborne watched the bullet pierce through Marvin's defenses, slicing into his flesh and blood. Then, with a terrifying eruption, the bullet's formidable power detonated within.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Earth Realm!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A desperate shout echoed as an expansive realm tried to form around Marvin, only to shatter instantly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A dreadful sound echoed through the air, and in the maelstrom of erupting energy and swirling dust, Marvin's body vanished completely, leaving behind no trace to be seen.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne, now utterly drained, watched anxiously.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was his ace, his most potent attack.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To amplify the divine power within the bullet, he exerted every ounce of his being, draining his vitality to its limits. Now, his complexion had turned ashen, and his robust frame trembled with a profound weakness.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Should this desperate gambit fail to inflict grave harm upon Marvin, Osborne would find himself utterly depleted, without even the scant energy required to flee.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gradually, the veil of dust started to thin, gently settling back to the earth.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the dust cleared, the figure of Marvin emerged into view. He was in a half-kneeling posture. The ground beneath him was stained with his blood. One of his arms was gruesomely severed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His complexion was deathly pale, a stark contrast to the fiery anger and lethal intent that blazed within his eyes.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You deserve death!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You possess such a formidable strike! You've actually obliterated one of my arms!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I kill you!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin emitted a menacing growl. With deliberate slowness, he rose to his feet and advanced towards Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A chilling aura of murderous intent enveloped Marvin.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this scene, Osborne sighed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It still doesn't work."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He managed a bitter smile. At this moment, his reserves were utterly exhausted; he couldn't summon the Light of Redemption even if he tried. In his depleted condition, even a Class A master could easily end his life.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite Marvin's grievous injuries and the loss of an arm, his capacity for combat was scarcely diminished. Killing Osborne in his vulnerable state would be all too effortless for Marvin.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll kill you!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin, consumed by wrath, approached Osborne and lifted his remaining hand high, poised to deliver a fatal strike to Osborne's head. Helpless and drained, Osborne had no means to evade the impending blow.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne closed his eyes, awaiting the end.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His quest to find his parents remained unfulfilled.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the end, death was his only companion.</p><div class="pagination">
