  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared with the information obtained by the Radcliffe family, the news acquired by the Paltrow family was more comprehensive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition to Osborne becoming the heir of the Augustine family, the Paltrow family also learned the news about Osborne's arrival at the Augustine Estate. They knew that some of the younger generation, including Ryan, challenged Osborne's authority, but in the end, he effortlessly defeated all four of them in a fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the details of the fight were reported in detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Alexander was sitting in the second seat in the Paltrow Estate's living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked through the information repeatedly, and a sneer gradually appeared on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person who was sitting in the main seat was his father, the current head of the Paltrow family, Robert Paltrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, what do you think of this news?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert looked at Alexander, his eyes full of appreciation and satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His most outstanding achievement in his lifetime was not becoming the family head of the Paltrow family, leading them to become stronger and ranking among the top three ancient clans in Dampston. Instead, it was having a good son. A son who had a divine phenomenon occurred at birth and possessed the extraordinary ability to manipulate lightning - Alexander Paltrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had a somewhat delicate appearance, neither tall nor robust, resembling more of a scholar. However, no one dared to underestimate him because five years ago, at the age of twenty-three, he had already become a Class B+ metahuman. After five years of cultivation, he had built up enough foundation to strive for the rank of a Class A master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he succeeded, he became the youngest metahuman master in Dampston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mere twenty-eight-year-old metahuman master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was known as the greatest prodigy in Dampston, and those who looked down on him were all dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, this Osborne is your love rival! It is said that he and your fianc&eacute;e Clarissa had already announced their relationship, and it was the Radcliffe family who separated them apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think they still have lingering feelings for each other, and he probably won't give up on Clarissa. His strength is also very impressive. His strength is also quite remarkable. Although the Augustine family has declined, the younger generation still possesses considerable power, especially Ryan, who is a Class B+ metahuman. Surprisingly, he joined forces with someone but was defeated by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This man should not be underestimated."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Robert's words, Alexander smiled faintly and finally set aside the documents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Father, you worry too much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although Ryan is at Class B+, he has only just broken through. Moreover, his ability is to control gravity. He does not have much offensive power against opponents of the same class. Once the gravitational field fails, he becomes powerless. He is not a concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for Nathan, Kaden, and Queenie? Bah! They are nothing but trash. I can crush them with just one finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The fact that Osborne was able to defeat them doesn't mean anything. In my eyes, he is not qualified to be my opponent. He is nothing more than an ant that I can easily crush."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, a strong sense of confidence appeared on Alexander's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert smiled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, it's good that you have such confidence in yourself, but you should never underestimate any opponent. Clarissa is a crucial person to you. She is the Fatebearer with immense fate power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can marry her and gain the blessing of the fate power, you will become even stronger. This place will no longer be able to limit you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although the fate power is prone to backlash, I believe in you. You can endure it! </span><span>Only by enduring the baptism of the power can you undergo another transformation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only then can you truly compare with and even surpass those true geniuses and prodigies in Newport City. You can even compete against those divine children from overseas!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert's expression became extremely solemn as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's face also became solemn, filled with a strong determination to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those geniuses and prodigies in Newport City? And the divine children from overseas? Hmph, once I break through and become a Class A metahuman master, I will challenge them sooner or later or even trample them under my feet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he said this, there was clearly a lack of confidence on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew very well how formidable those people were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He might become a master at the age of twenty-eight, becoming the youngest master in Dampston. However, in Newport City, many had already become masters before the age of twenty-eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And overseas, there were even more such individuals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Alexander was confident, he also knew that facing those individuals in his current state would only result in a devastating defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, now he had an opportunity right in front of him, and that was Clarissa, a Fatebearer, the woman with fate power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The great prophet had said that marrying her and enduring the baptism of the fate power within her would allow one to soar to new heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander knew that it was dangerous, but he decided to give it a try.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, he must marry Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Osborne, the person who had a deep relationship with her, must die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon thinking of this, Alexander's face turned cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Father, you don't need to worry about Osborne's affairs. I will handle it myself! But recently, I feel that I can no longer suppress myself. I'm afraid I will break through soon. It's not convenient for me to take action myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll have Yohan and Lauren to handle it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With their abilities, Osborne won't be able to make any waves! If he is smart, he would just back off. But if he refuses to do so...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will make sure he meets a very tragic end!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
