  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian, Nathan, and the others were flushed with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Witnessing Osborne single-handedly defeat Shawn and intimidate all the ancient families of </span><span>Dampston</span><span> into submission filled them with immense pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was the heir to the Augustine family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From now on, nobody would dare to underestimate the </span><span>Augustines</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as Osborne remained, nobody would dare to offend the </span><span>Augustines</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's name would sweep across </span><span>Dampston</span><span> like a storm, even reaching the neighboring provinces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words filled them with an unparalleled sense of pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even at the peak of the Augustine family's power, no one had dared to speak with such authority in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Paltrow family's assets, the Augustine family will take them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone who dares to obstruct or compete, just kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian, Nathan, and the others were ecstatic. Their eyes shone with admiration for Osborne, their faces beaming with pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, at the inheritance ceremony, Alexander had publicly humiliated them. Back then, they didn't dare to resist, and no one came to their aid. All they received were sneers and mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Osborne had killed Alexander and eradicated the entire Paltrow family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who had once ridiculed them had fled in disgrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were ecstatic!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were proud!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, well done! I knew we weren't wrong about you. You truly did it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian excitedly patted Osborne's shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "Brian, this is what I should do. Let's go back now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian nodded, walking half a step behind Osborne, his heart brimming with excitement as they returned to the Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought back to a month ago when the </span><span>Augustines</span><span> were in dire straits. Their businesses were under attack, accidents plagued their leadership, and even the head of the family had perished at sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone thought the </span><span>Augustines</span><span> were finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, someone told him and Isaac that there was someone who could save the family. The person was Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, he didn't believe it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rushed to </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> himself, and the moment he laid eyes on Osborne, he knew it was over. Osborne was far too young. He couldn't possibly save the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, he still brought Osborne back to the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As instructed, they concealed Osborne's true identity, presenting him as the long-lost son of the previous patriarch, Allen. Osborne became the heir to the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From then on, the fate of the </span><span>Augustines</span><span> changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of Osborne, the Ghost Ship, which had been secretly targeting the businesses of the Augustine family, was destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of Osborne, the traitor within the family, Ryan, was exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of Osborne, </span><span>Augustines</span><span>' Maritime Auction was a huge success, and their cruise business was back on track, doing better than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And also because of Osborne...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Paltrow family, which had been secretly working against the </span><span>Augustines</span><span>, was eradicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Paltrows</span><span>' vast assets would now belong to the </span><span>Augustines</span><span>. Once they integrated </span><span>those assets, the </span><span>Augustines</span><span> would become one of the most prominent old families in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything was because of Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian looked at Osborne with excitement and a hint of regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If only Osborne were truly the heir of the Augustine family!" he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the group returned to the Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, news of what had happened to the Paltrow family had already reached them. All the direct descendants of the Augustine family were overjoyed and personally went to the entrance to welcome Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at him with excited and admiring eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Isaac, in his wheelchair, waited at the gate, his face flushed with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took some effort for Osborne to send everyone away. He and Clarissa personally pushed Isaac's wheelchair into the conference hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne! You did well!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac looked at Osborne and sighed, "That esteemed individual was right. You really did it! It's a pity you're not a true Augustine. Otherwise, I would declare you the head of the family right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're willing to stay, I'll give you the position of patriarch. Everyone in the Augustine family will see you as their true leader!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly replied, "Isaac, please don't get too excited. I don't want to be a patriarch. I'll have to leave the Augustine family sooner or later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac sighed, "Indeed, someone as outstanding as you can't stay in the small Augustine family forever. You belong to a wider world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But no matter what, I want to thank you on behalf of the Augustine family. You've given us new life. No matter where you are in the future, the Augustine family will always be your support!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and nodded. "Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Clarissa, standing behind Osborne, had a look of surprise and confusion on her pretty face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The conversation between Osborne and Isaac left her puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne noticed her confusion, took her hand, and smiled, "Clarissa, there's something I need to confess to you. My true identity isn't that of a member of the Augustine family. The reason I became their heir was simply due to a deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that you know I'm not the heir to an ancient family, do you feel disappointed? Do you regret following me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Clarissa playfully glared at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said gently, "Osborne, I don't care about your identity at all! Whether you're the heir to an old family or just an ordinary person, it's all the same to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just want to be with you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wherever you go, I'll go!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
