Osborne and I were married, living together for three years!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Clarissa responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She calmly looked at Ophelia and said, "Osborne told me all of this already.

You, a goddess, would not be with him if you knew he was divorced. It is not possible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I do not regret it; I am just worried for you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, Osborne is worthless.

If time could be rewound, I would never have made such a hasty decision."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia stood there in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley then sneered, "Ms. Radcliffe, even if you do not care about Osborne's past, do you also ignore his character?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He just tried to molest and assault my guest! Many people saw it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Wesley finished speaking, Clarissa's expression grew colder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said coldly, "Do you mean to say Osborne would be interested in such a filthy woman? Do you think Osborne would lay hands on her, even attempt to assault her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is she more beautiful than me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does she have a better figure?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think I'm a fool?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley was left speechless, his mouth agape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "Actually, the truth of what happened, whether I tried to molest or assault that woman, can be easily proven."</span></p><div class="pagination">
