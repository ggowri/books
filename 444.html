  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in Isa's mansion, Osborne let out a painful roar, blood gushing from every pore on his body. Every cell in his body was convulsing and trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the most horrifying sight was his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood poured from them like a river.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one knew what Osborne was going through at this moment. The only witness was Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa watched Osborne anxiously, tears welling up in her eyes as she clenched her fists tightly, unable to do anything to help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because at this moment, Osborne had to face this alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!" Isa sobbed, murmuring. "Maybe I shouldn't have let you take this path. If I had known it would be this painful, I would never have let you go through it! I'm sorry. I was too impatient!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't die, you just can't! As long as you're alive, nothing else matters! This is the most critical moment, hold on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, Isa's expression softened with a feminine tenderness. Her gaze lingered on Osborne's suffering with profound concern, wishing she could somehow take his pain away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne's mind was consumed by agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even wanted to just die and be done with it. If he died, the pain would end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he kept holding on. He had reasons to keep fighting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His sister was still in a coma, with only a little more than six months left, and he hadn't found a cure yet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was still waiting for him to save her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still hadn't gotten to the bottom of the accident that happened to his parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa had placed her hopes in him, and he hadn't repaid her yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he couldn't die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne held on, even as blood streamed uncontrollably from his eyes, and every cell in his body felt like it was boiling. Still, he persisted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His soul of powers had now fully merged with his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying and complete transformation was rapidly taking place, changing Osborne's very being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it almost... successful?" Isa suddenly shuddered, sensing something was going on, and looked at Osborne with overwhelming joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, dark clouds descended upon Pinchide City, plunging it into darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless bolts of lightning began to gather with alarming speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simultaneously, the once calm sea churned into monstrous waves, and the ground shook violently as if the entire city were facing an apocalyptic disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This... this is a phenomenon?! He's finally done it! He's broken through to become a Class A Power Master, but why is his breakthrough causing such a terrifying spectacle?" Isa was utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this phenomenon continued, Pinchide City would likely face a disaster, with half the city submerged or destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa frowned, then suddenly let out a cold snort. She reached out her hand toward the empty space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!" she commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a buzz, an immense power surged from Isa. The strange phenomena that had gripped Pinchide City came to a sudden stop as if time itself had been paused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dark clouds and lightning that had shrouded the sky vanished, replaced by a clear, sunny sky once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The massive waves calmed abruptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trembling ground stilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if nothing had happened at all, leaving the countless people of Pinchide City dazed and confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa let out a long sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She acted as if she had just done something insignificant, then looked back at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pained expression on Osborne's face was quickly fading away. His pale complexion was quickly turning rosy again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A powerful surge of energy was slowly erupting from within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled, "You never disappoint me! You did it! You actually did it! You actually made this legendary path, a path no one has ever succeeded in!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What heights will you reach in the future? I can't wait to see it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Isa wiped the tears from her face and smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, over at the Paltrow Estate, Alexander's succession ceremony was underway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes were on Alexander as he solemnly accepted the lightning staff, the symbol of the Paltrow family's power, from the hands of the former patriarch, Robert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the sky turned dark, filled with ominous clouds and crackling lightning. The ground began to tremble violently as if the world was ending.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, the thousands of guests were terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one knew what was happening. They could only feel an immense power building in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, the strange phenomenon quickly subsided, and everything returned to normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my gosh! It was a supernatural phenomenon!" Wade suddenly shouted excitedly. "Alexander, from this moment on, you are officially the head of the Paltrow family. This phenomenon occurred just as you grasped the lightning staff&mdash;it's a sign that the gods have acknowledged you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, the guests burst into a frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A supernatural phenomenon?" they wondered. "So the apocalyptic scene just now was actually caused by Alexander? All because he officially became the head of the Paltrow family, and it triggered such a strange phenomenon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that was true, Alexander was truly a force to be reckoned with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was shocked and envious as they looked at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such a strange phenomenon..." someone murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He might really be the chosen one of the gods!" one of the prodigies exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Paltrow family might truly thrive under his leadership!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
