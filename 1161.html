  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart began to pound violently, but it wasn't his heart alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Cross fused with him throbbed as if it had come to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Cross seemed like a wild creature, driving his heart into an erratic frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood frozen, a frown creasing his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Cross had never reacted this intensely before, as if something ahead was beckoning it, something powerful enough to pull it away from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unsure if this was a blessing or a curse, Osborne hesitated for a moment. The air around him felt charged, but sensing no immediate danger, he steeled himself. The agitation of the Blood Cross grew more pronounced, and after a moment's hesitation, Osborne gritted his teeth and pressed on, determined to uncover the source of its restlessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Blood Cross is integrated with my body, but it feels like the bond isn't entirely complete. Right now, I can sense that if I don't keep moving forward, the Blood Cross might detach from me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression darkened at that thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Cross was of paramount importance to him&mdash;not just for enhancing his own strength, although that mattered too, but because it was the anchor for the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without the Blood Cross, they would struggle to evolve further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given their innate talents, reaching even the pinnacle of Class S would be the best they could manage, and forging a Divine Body to attain godhood would be nearly </span><span>impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne would never willingly let go of the Blood Cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the strange circumstances surrounding him, he had to see where this all led.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he journeyed down the tunnel, the red light grew increasingly brilliant, radiating like pulsing blood. Even Osborne's powerful Level Seven Satan's Eye couldn't pierce through the harsh glow, rendering everything beyond 16 feet a blank void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tension coiled within him as Osborne slowed his pace, becoming cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He released his martial art aura, wrapping himself in a protective barrier, keeping an eye out for any lurking Dark Exotic Beasts that might spring forth from the crimson light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to his astonishment, his martial art aura offered no defense against the red glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It enveloped his body, infiltrating it effortlessly until it finally settled on the Blood Cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Cross surged with energy, making Osborne's heart race even faster. Within the eerily silent tunnel, it sounded like thunderous drumbeats were echoing off the walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The relentless rhythm pushed his blood through his veins at breakneck speed, turning his skin a vivid crimson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt as if the Blood Cross was urging Osborne forward, compelling him to uncover whatever lay ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's brows knitted in concentration, a mix of anxiety and insatiable curiosity clawing at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What in the world could it be? Is it the previous owner of the Blood Cross?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That thought jolted through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the tapestry of myth and lore, the Blood Cross was intrinsically tied to Cain, the progenitor of the Blood Clan. Cain was often hailed as the God of Sin, the God of Immortality. And yes, some went as far as to dub him the God of Darkness, a moniker also attributed to Isa's teacher, the God of Night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Cain was not the same as the God of Night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One was merely a figure from folklore, a shadowed myth whispered among the people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other was the most powerful Deity King, universally recognized during the Age of Gods&mdash;the true God of Night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne considered this, he figured that Isa's teacher was likely far stronger than Cain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that didn't mean Cain was weak by any stretch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain's greatest asset lay in the legendary&mdash;his immortality! This was a superpower that no other god possessed, not even a Deity King, who could either dissipate into nothingness or be reborn with their memories intact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the progenitor of the Blood Clan, Cain, was said to be indestructible. Even if his body was reduced to mincemeat and his soul was obliterated, he could still regenerate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the power of his immortality!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this raised a perplexing question. If Cain truly possessed immortality and could not be destroyed, how could his treasure, the Blood Cross, end up in the hands </span><span>of Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had Cain, with an immortal body, really perished? Or was he still alive?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had no answers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intense reaction of the Blood Cross now made Osborne fear that Cain might still be alive. After all, Cain had been the Blood Cross' previous owner, and such a drastic reaction from the relic was only natural.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This speculation sent Osborne on high alert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He began to consider leaving this place, for Cain, the progenitor of the Blood Clan, was no ordinary god.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it was indeed Cain ahead, Osborne would not stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He might not even be able to escape!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne couldn't bring himself to abandon the Blood Cross. Gritting his teeth, he pressed on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My luck can't be that awful! The Blood Cross reacting so violently doesn't necessarily mean it's Cain. It could be something else entirely..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
