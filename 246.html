  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia finished speaking, but she didn't hear Evelyn's response for a long time, so she looked over immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She saw Evelyn looking restless, as if she was thinking something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, what are you thinking about? Why do I feel like something is wrong with you </span><span>these days? Ever since Osborne and I divorced, you've always been absent-minded."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn came back to her senses again and quickly shook her head. "No, I didn't think about anything. Ophelia, do you think Osborne will come to your wedding tomorrow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia couldn't help but frown as she heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you asking him for? Whether he comes or not, it won't change anything! I have completely broken up with him. After tomorrow, I will be Wesley's wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, that useless person, only knows how to curry favor with women. </span><span>First</span><span> he flattered Alison, then Clarissa, and finally even Austin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph, Osborne relied on the women he fawned over to make Wesley and I suffer a lot, but in my heart, he is still a waste! Without women, he is nothing and is not as good as Wesley at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Evelyn looked hesitant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ophelia, do you really think so? Don't you think that Osborne has changed a lot since he divorced you? He's like a different person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph, so what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia looked unhappy. "No matter how he changes, he can't change his social status as a member of the lower class! He and Wesley are not from the same world!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he knows what's best for him, he'd better not show up at tomorrow's wedding and not affect the mood of Wesley and me. If he dares to show up, I don't mind embarrassing him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn wanted to say something, as if she had a different opinion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, she just said, "Ophelia, I heard a piece of news recently, which kept me awake."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? What news? I've been busy preparing for the wedding recently and haven't paid much attention to news from the outside world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia became interested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn asked, "Do you know the Chevalier family and </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I know," Ophelia said with envy and admiration. "The Chevalier family is an ancient family in </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>. It is said to be more powerful than the Radcliffe family. They control a huge amount of wealth and power, which is not accessible to us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security, it is the top ranked security company in </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> with strong capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, why are you mentioning them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn gritted her teeth, saying, "I heard that the Chevalier family was wiped out! The one who did it was the mysterious boss of </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security, and that mysterious boss, his name is...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia looked shocked. In her eyes, the Chevalier family, which she couldn't please, was actually destroyed by someone. And the person who destroyed them actually had the same name as her useless ex-husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Were they all called Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Evelyn who was in a trance and said with a smile, "Mom, you are not </span><span>losing your mind because of this matter, are you? Don't you think that Osborne, the mysterious boss of </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security, is my useless ex-husband?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn bit her lip. "I have a bad feeling and I suspect that Osborne..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish her words, Ophelia interrupted her with laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said disdainfully, "Mom, are you thinking too much? We know best how useless he is! In the Caldwell family for three years, anyone can bully him, so how can he have any ability?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could he be that Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he had that kind of ability, how could he be humiliated in the Caldwell family? It's only been a month since Osborne divorced me, so it's impossible that he has completed his transformation in just one month, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn opened her mouth and wanted to say something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ophelia continued to interrupt her, "Mom, don't think too much! They just have the same name. The big shot who can destroy the Chevalier family is as dazzling as the stars in the sky. How could he be my useless ex-husband?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Osborne really has that kind of ability, how could I possibly divorce him? I am not stupid! Therefore, how could I not see his ability after three years of marriage?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tomorrow is my wedding, let's not let that loser affect our mood."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn took a deep breath and finally stopped talking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just at this moment, Wesley called her, and then Ophelia quickly answered the phone with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two chatted for a while, and she suddenly said, "Wesley, that loser Osborne might show up at tomorrow's wedding. You have to be prepared. Don't let him ruin our wedding."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Wesley heard Osborne's name, he sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of the times he had suffered losses in front of Osborne, he showed a lot of anger and displeasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Ophelia. Tomorrow I will be in control of the entire venue, and I am already prepared. If that loser, Osborne, doesn't come, forget it. If he dares to come, I will make him completely embarrassed in front of everyone and become a joke!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Ophelia finally felt relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated for a moment but still asked, "Wesley, have you heard of Osborne from </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression suddenly became serious, and a look of admiration appeared on his face.</span></p><div class="pagination">
