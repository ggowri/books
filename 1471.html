  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne was taken aback. "A starting bid of thirty million? What kind of slave is the auction house boasting about this time?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it really be a Deity Overlord warrior?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That seems unlikely!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly dismissed that thought. "If it were truly a Deity Overlord slave, the bidding would start higher than 30 million. So, what kind of slave could possibly justify such a staggering price?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it due to high status?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Exceptional beauty?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outstanding talent?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or something else entirely?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curiosity gnawed at him, especially since this slave was confirmed to have human blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With a Human Community lineage, it might be worth taking the plunge just to see what kind of slave she is.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Essence Crystals are just numbers to me. I wouldn't bat an eye at spending a few extra if it means satisfying my curiosity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne raised his paddle. "I bid 30 million!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he spoke, the once-noisy auction hall fell into an unsettling silence. Everyone turned to stare at him, shock plastered across their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one expected that anyone would actually bid on a slave with such limited information, especially at the absurd starting price of 30 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is he out of his mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few in the crowd stared at Osborne with mocking eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think he's falling into a trap! That's what this slave market is banking on&mdash;luring in this clueless human. He's the type who impulsively buys any enslaved human, no matter the cost! The slave market knows that and has set this trap for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why else would they point out that this slave has half human blood?" one person murmured, analyzing the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words struck a chord, and murmurs of agreement rippled through the crowd. Osborne suddenly felt more like a target for their ridicule.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe it's not the slave market pulling the strings but rather the client trying to con this guy! You love bidding on human slaves, right? Rich, right? Well, here's a thirty-million-dollar human slave for you. What's your choice? Bid or lose her? If you don't buy her, she'll just be wiped out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laughter erupted, echoing in the hall. "That actually makes sense! This slave might have been thrown in at the last moment, and surely only a Super VIP could pull that off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too bad we're not Super VIPs! Otherwise, I'd be tempted to auction off a bunch of human slaves myself at a high price just to sell them to this guy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such a shame!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd continued to gossip, their whispers reaching Osborne's ears. Yet he remained unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he, too, questioned whether this unexpected auction item was some kind of trick, it didn't bother him in the least. Thirty million Essence Crystals was a drop in the bucket for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, this auction was about to close, and he hadn't spent a cent of his allotted 100 million Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to secure his status as a Super VIP in the slave market, and buying this special hybrid slave was his golden ticket. In his mind, a reputable market wouldn't engage in such shady schemes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, with a calm expression, Osborne awaited the end of the auction, eager to find out what made this thirty-million-dollar hybrid human slave so extraordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, no one else stepped up to challenge his bid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The auctioneer swiftly brought his hammer down. "Thirty million low-grade Essence Crystals, sold!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned to Tiana. "So, Ms. Tiana Hart, I guess I can call myself a Super VIP of the slave market now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana nodded, then shook her head slightly. "You've spent an impressive total of 116 million Essence Crystals at our auction, which meets the criteria to become a Super VIP. Once the auction wraps up and the transactions are processed in the back, you'll officially receive your Super VIP badge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne inclined his head, rising from his seat. "In that case, let's head backstage. I'm curious to see just what kind of mysterious slave I bought for 30 million Essence Crystals."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana smiled, "Oh, you won't be disappointed! But before we go, there's one last batch of items up for bid. This group is quite special&mdash;human slaves with a significant number involved, all commissioned by the Dark Deity Legion from the West Zone. Are you sure you don't want to take a look at this final offering before heading to the back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow, intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Human slaves? A large quantity? Commissioned by the Dark Deity Legion? Could it be..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thought began to form in his mind, and with a more serious expression, he sat back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, let's see what they have then!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the auctioneer cleared his throat, capturing the crowd's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached the final segment of our auction. Up next is the last batch of slaves for today&mdash;the stakes are high! These individuals are no ordinary slaves; they were once elite warriors from the human resistance in the West Zone, captured soldiers of the Dark Deity Legion. It took considerable effort to bring them in. However..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
