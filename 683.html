Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will it be Emma, the most gifted of the Augustine family's younger generation? Or Matthew, the most resourceful and popular of the younger generation? Or Owen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Owen's points, Osborne didn't feel right. He just couldn't imagine how Owen had gotten so many points, not losing out to Emma and Vincent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could that be because of Lance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lance's score hasn't grown in a long time. Could it be that Lance gave up his chance to help Owen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stroked his chin, thinking that this was the only possible explanation for Owen's unusual points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne soon didn't care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the power he had now, Owen and Lance were way out of his league. Even if they teamed up, they couldn't touch </span><span>him.</span><span>"Keep</span><span> up the counterattack! By the time we've completely destroyed the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, I should have enough points to ensure I get first place! As for who comes in second place, it's none of my business!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about it, Osborne began to cultivate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he didn't know that his several competitors were all silent when they saw the scoreboard, their eyes filled with despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They took a chance on their plan of attack and ended up winning. Their points were close to Osborne's, and they had expected to overtake them soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had scored eight thousand points in just one battle, bringing the gap between them once again to a level that made them almost despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been almost half a month since the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> had started this battle, and they </span><span>had gone through more than a dozen battles with a lot of losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they got far less than eight thousand total points as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the circumstances, even if Emma had absolute confidence, she couldn't help but begin to doubt herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How the hell did he do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma frowned tightly and turned to an older man behind her, "Grandpa, Caleb's with Osborne, right? He must know the situation. You and Caleb have a good relationship, so why don't you ask him for me? I'm really curious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man nodded when he heard that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was Emma's grandfather, James Augustine, the fourth elder of the main bloodline from the Augustine family. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Osborne had gotten eight thousand points, not only was Emma curious, he was also inquisitive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll contact Caleb, but I can't guarantee he'll tell me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, James began to make a phone call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma waited patiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, James finally hung up the phone, his face full of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, what's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma asked in a hurry, "Is it true that Osborne has found a powerful helper?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Caleb told me that they counterattacked the headquarters in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, killing three members from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> who had reached Class AAA and a dozen warriors who had reached Class AA."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three Class AAA? A dozen Class AA? That&rsquo;s sick!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma murmured, "With Caleb, Janet, and Osborne, they have a way to do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James shook his head. "That wasn't the case. Caleb to</span><span>ld me none of them had even attacked, not </span><span>even Osborne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The attacker was </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span> from the Radcliffe family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She killed all three warriors of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> who reached Class AAA all on her own! Also, it only took her a short time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma was stunned when James finished speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Fatebearer</span><span> from the Radcliffe family? How is that possible? I've heard of her, but I remember she's not even twenty years old. How could she have such power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James said seriously, "She's not an ordinary woman! She makes me think of someone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vivienne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vivienne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma became incredibly surprised. Although she had never met Vivienne, she had heard her name countless times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivienne had reached Class AAA when she was less than twenty years old!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She married Godfat</span><span>h</span><span>er's son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivienne was also Emma's idol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma took a deep breath. "So that's it! We can explain that. Why is she helping </span><span>Osborne though?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James said, "She's Osborne's girlfriend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma looked shocked when she heard it.</span></p><div class="pagination">
