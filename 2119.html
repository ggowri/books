  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of the way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of figures were frantically fleeing through the Corrosive Marsh, their faces painted with fear. At the back of the group, a tall, imposing figure unleashed a surge of power, knocking back the monstrous forms that pursued them, protecting the others as they made their escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Prince Chuck of the Sylvan Elf Clan, an Ascension Six Supernal Deity King, who should have been one of the brightest stars among the youth of Elf City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet now, he looked utterly disheveled, his face pale and drawn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was on the brink of collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chuck, hurry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A familiar voice cut through the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was his sister, Princess Joanna, her expression frantic as she urged him to keep going. Chuck turned to glance at her, his heart sinking at the sight of her distress. The bitterness etched on his face deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They might not make it out alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regret washed over him like a cold wave. Chuck cursed his overconfidence for ignoring Uriel's warnings and leading Joanna's exploration team into the treacherous depths of the Corrosive Marsh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could turn back time, he would have chosen differently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Corrosive Marsh was indeed a deadly place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he watched the towering figures he had just blasted into the muck reemerge, despair flickered in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those towering figures were Mud Golems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mud Golems were a terrifying fusion of the swamp's soil and a unique crystal, taking on human-like forms but standing at least 16 feet tall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their attack methods were straightforward yet devastating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One was the sheer brute force of their massive fists, capable of delivering a blow so powerful that it bypassed divine power defenses and even skin, directly shattering internal organs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A person struck by a Mud Golem might appear unscathed on the outside, but their insides would be pulverized, leading to instant death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Chuck, despite his Ascension Six status, couldn't withstand many hits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For those at Ascension Four or Five, a single punch would likely be fatal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Mud Golems weren't particularly fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under normal circumstances, even an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King could evade them easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they had a second attack method that compensated for their sluggishness&mdash;a binding technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blue crystal embedded in the Golem's chest would pulse with an eerie light, enveloping everything in front of it. Anyone caught in that glow would enter a dazed state, and those lacking sufficient soul power would be unable to escape, left vulnerable until the Golem closed in for the kill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Chuck found it difficult to break free from the Golem's grasp, each attempt draining his divine and soul power significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, exhaustion was creeping in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was barely holding on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he looked at Joanna in the distance, and at the surviving members of his team, Chuck bit down hard on his tongue, using the sharp pain and the taste of blood to revive his focus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With all his strength, he pushed back against the Mud Golem, sending it crashing into the swamp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he quickly retreated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run!" he shouted, urgency lacing his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chuck shielded the team members and continued to flee into the distance. He enveloped Joanna, Letitia, and others who only had an Ascension Four cultivation level with his power and ran for their lives like there was no tomorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting his teeth, he persevered, thinking that as long as they could get out of the Corrosive Marsh, they'd be safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alas, his hopes were doomed to be dashed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, they'd long lost their sense of direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did they know that the way they were heading wasn't out of the Corrosive Marsh, but deeper into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a series of bubbles burst out of the marsh right in front of them. As the bubbles popped, they made a faint sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that sound was enough to send looks of sheer terror across the faces of the dozens of survivors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's the corrosive bubbles!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run for your lives!" Chuck let out a thunderous roar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He unleashed his divine power to the fullest, scooped up everyone around him, and darted to the side, just managing to avoid the area blanketed by the corrosive marsh gas after the bubbles burst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But not everyone was as lucky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eleven guards of the Sylvan Elf Clan Royal Family and seven warriors from the Racial Convergence Planet didn't have time to escape. In an instant, they were engulfed by the corrosive marsh gas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, horr</span><span>ible things</span><span> unfolded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their bodies started to corrode and melt rapidly, just like ice cubes under the mid-day sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aaah!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aaah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood-curdling screams filled the marsh. Prince Chuck, watching from afar, felt his eyes turn bloodshot, but he was utterly helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he was an Ascension Six Supernal Deity King, he didn't dare to rush into the corrosive marsh gas to save them. That terrifying gas could corrode almost everything except the marsh mud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even his divine power couldn't penetrate it; otherwise, it would be corroded in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, eighteen people were gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chuck's eyes were bloodshot. Princess Joanna, Letitia, Jaden, Renata, and the others he'd saved were now trembling violently with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was so damn dangerous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Corrosive Marsh was a nightmare!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were more than a dozen huge Mud Golems chasing them from behind, and corrosive bubbles could pop up anywhere at any time. They felt like they were in the depths of hell, on the verge of being buried alive at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chuck, can we still make it out alive?" Princess Joanna murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Prince Chuck bit his lip hard and said nothing, for even he wasn't confident anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, not far behind them, more Mud Golems emerged from the marsh, only a few hundred feet yards away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's faces paled in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Prince Chuck gritted his teeth, shouting, "Keep running! I don't know if we can make it out alive. But I do know it's not time to give up yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as I've got a breath left in me, I'll fight tooth and nail to get you out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he wrapped his power around several people and continued their mad dash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Princess Joanna said through gritted teeth, "Chuck, just leave us behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're only at Ascension Four. We're just holding you back here. You go and save yourself. Without us slowing you down, you'll definitely make it out alive. It's better for one of us to survive than all of us to die here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she said that, Jaden, Renata, and Letitia all shuddered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A look of struggle flashed across Chuck's face, but in the end, he shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way! I brought you in here, and I'm going to get you out. I'll never leave you behind and run for my own skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop talking and keep running!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Chuck sprinted forward at breakneck speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the marsh in front of them exploded, and more than a dozen Mud Golems charged out, blocking their way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, the crystals on the Mud Golems' chests suddenly glowed with a bright blue light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The light enveloped everyone in an instant, and they found themselves completely immobilized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, despair washed over their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all over!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
