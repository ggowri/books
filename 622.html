  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Training Base No. 6 was nestled in a canyon. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt someone gaze at him as he approached within three miles of the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He activated his Satan's Eye to scan the surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly discovered that at least a dozen individuals were lurking in hiding, well-disguised. Without the immense power of his Satan's Eye, Osborne would have </span><span>struggled to detect them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their powers were at Class B+ or A-.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seems like they're all students from Training Base No. 6! Should I test their strength first?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this thought, Osborne couldn't help but chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his current strength, dealing with Class B+ or A- metahumans was akin to handling ordinary people. Even facing a regular Class A metahuman, he could defeat them with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was curious about their techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I come across a few stronger ones, I might as well give it a try!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, and his body vanished in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He utilized the dark elemental power to move through the shadows of the forest swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back when David used the dark elemental power to sneak around, Osborne had a hard time detecting him even with his Satan's Eye active. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, as he used this power to move stealthily, the sentries outside Training Base No. 6 naturally had no chance of noticing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne swiftly passed through their defense perimeter and arrived at Training Base No. 6.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the canyon was bustling with activity. Twenty instructors and five hundred students&mdash;excluding those on guard duty&mdash;were all present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne instantly zeroed in on the twenty instructors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a look of pleasant surprise appeared on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not bad. Three Class AA and eight Class A+ metahumans! Although not all are Class AA, it's still quite impressive. They will be a tremendous force if I utilize them well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hid in the shadows, observing their training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their training essentially involved sparring, enhancing their abilities, and gaining more combat experience through real battles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After watching for a while, Osborne couldn't help but be amazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He found that all the instructors and students at Training Base No. 6 were skilled martial artists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them had mastered numerous advanced martial arts techniques, such as Spiral Force, Ninefold Tide Crash, Stretch Soft Force, and even </span><span>Point Blank</span><span> Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every one of the hundreds of students had at least one advanced martial art technique; some had mastered several, and all had reached a basic level of proficiency, with some even achieving proficiency level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The instructors were even more formidable. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each had mastered multiple advanced martial arts techniques, all at least at the proficiency level. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne even saw an instructor who had taken Stretch Soft Force to the extreme level. He was astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, even Osborne hadn't taken Stretch Soft Force to the extreme. He had only reached the extreme level with Spiral Force and Ninefold Tide Crash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impressive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was delighted. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The instructors and students worked together with perfect coordination, like actual soldiers. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his eyes, they were a group of mighty warriors who had undergone rigorous training. Their individual strength might not be extreme, but their combined strength would be formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could unleash formidable power on the battlefield at any time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What truly surprised Osborne was not this but the fact that each of them possessed the same shape-shifting power&mdash;Vampire Transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All twenty instructors and five hundred students could transform into Vampires, enhancing their speed, strength, defense, and recovery capabilities. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, their appearance after transformation was slightly different from Osborne's Vampire form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't have blood-red long hair. Their fangs were shorter, and their claws were also shorter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, compared to Osborne's Vampire Transformation, their transformation seemed to be a weakened version, but it still greatly enhanced their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, since so many people possessed Vampire Transformation, it must not have been naturally activated but caused by some kind of genetic potion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was to say, Training Base No. 6 had the means to enable ordinary people to activate the power of Vampire Transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling their Vampire Transformation, Osborne suddenly found that the Blood Cross in his body seemed particularly excited, with waves of powerful energy surging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Strange, why is it reacting like this? Could it be that these people's Vampire Transformation is related to my Blood Cross?" Osborne thought quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's there? Who is it?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a loud shout rang out, and then the twenty instructors and nearly five hundred students of Training Base No. 6 moved in an instant, surrounding the place where Osborne was hiding in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was surprised. He had been discovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was because the Blood Cross's abnormal reaction had leaked a bit of energy fluctuation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the fact that such a slight fluctuation exposed him showed that these instructors and students were indeed well-trained and capable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne smiled, withdrawing the dark elemental power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body appeared slowly into their view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone had a hostile look at his appearance. It was unacceptable for them that someone had infiltrated the training base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We got an intruder! Kill him, no matter who he is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A stern shout rang out, and a group of instructors and students immediately took action.</span></p><div class="pagination">
