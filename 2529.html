  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Dalia's words, the others immediately showed excited expressions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone asked, "Ms. Gibbs, have you received the leader's orders?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dalia nodded and said, "Yes. The leader has informed me to act immediately. We'll now activate the Supreme Bewitching Formation and kill everyone."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, everyone was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone said doubtfully, "Are we acting now? When will the leader act? In the Phantomagic Realm, there are over twenty people at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection and hundreds at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection. We, being only at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, might not be able to manage it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dalia glanced at the person who had just spoken.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said calmly, "Are you doubting the leader's methods? The leader will appear when necessary. Besides, with our strength, we are more than capable of killing them all. After all, in the Supreme Bewitching Formation, warriors at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection are nothing but lambs to the slaughter. In any case, we must act immediately."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Got it!" The others dared not say more and immediately sat down. Each person took out a dagger and plunged it fiercely into their own chest. Instantly, blood spattered everywhere.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, they showed no signs of pain; instead, they were filled with excitement. The blood spurting from their chests was quickly guided by their power, forming countless intricate blood-colored patterns in the void.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the blood-colored patterns increased, strands of unique energy suddenly burst forth, spreading around. At that moment, the hidden Bewitching Lanterns began to tremble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The protective shields around the Bewitching Lanterns shattered in an instant. The Bewitching Lanterns seemed to be fully activated at that moment, no longer suppressing their power. Then, the pink light they emitted became dazzlingly bright, instantly enveloping the entire Phantomagic Realm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The pitch-black Phantomagic Realm instantly turned into a sea of pink.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, everyone still in the Phantomagic Realm sensed something was wrong. They immediately tried to defend themselves, but it was completely useless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The pink light easily penetrated their defenses and landed on their bodies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, everyone's eyes turned blank.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Like waves, wherever the pink light spread, people instantly fell into confusion, as if they had lost their senses, standing dazedly in place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne looked up at the approaching pink light, his expression turning extremely grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Has it finally begun?" Osborne said through gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment the pink light fell on him, he felt an immensely powerful soul impact. Countless illusions flashed in his mind, and his aura began to plummet rapidly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My cultivation level has dropped?" Osborne was shocked. But soon, he realized it was all an illusion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, at this moment, he couldn't dispel the illusion or return to normal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bewitching Formation has activated! Primordial!" Osborne called out to Primordial, but there was no response.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The power of the Bewitching Formation directly acted on Osborne's Soul Current Ocean. Although it didn't cause direct damage to his Soul Current Ocean, it seemed to sever his connection with Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Osborne's expression even more serious. He thought, "My Soul Current Ocean is incredibly strong, and Primordial and the Warfare Ancient Tree are inside it. But my Soul Current Ocean still can't resist the power of the Bewitching Formation. I've lost control of my body."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I'm afraid even warriors at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection can't withstand the power of the Bewitching Formation and would be trapped in it just like me. If someone attacks us at this moment, they could easily kill us.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No wonder that demonic cultivator from Blossom Cage is confident in dealing with so many people. The Bewitching Formation is truly terrifying. Moreover, those Bewitching Lanterns absorbed the power of the Phantomagic Realm, making the Bewitching Formation even stronger. No, I must break free."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne knew he had to break free from the Bewitching Formation first before taking the next step.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "The Bewitching Formation is a method of those Bewitching Lanterns. But most of the Bewitching Lanterns already bear my Soulbrand. As long as I want, I can activate my Soulbrand to control the power of those Bewitching Lanterns, rendering them unable to affect me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now is not the time to activate the Soulbrand. The demonic cultivator behind Blossom Cage has yet to show up."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was thinking about how to break free from the power of the Bewitching Formation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, he suddenly felt his Soul Current Ocean surging. Then, all the illusions before his eyes quickly receded like a tide.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt his own body and sensed Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We finally resolved it," Primordial's laughter echoed in Osborne's mind. "This Bewitching Formation is so powerful, even I got caught. Fortunately, the Warfare Ancient Tree was unaffected and woke us up from the Bewitching Formation. Osborne, what's the situation outside?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Primordial's words, Osborne finally understood that it was the Warfare Ancient Tree that woke them up from the Bewitching Formation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly opened his eyes and looked outside, but the scene he saw left him utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the Phantomagic Realm was shrouded in a dense pink hue. All the creatures in the Phantomagic Realm were trapped in the Bewitching Formation, standing there like statues, completely motionless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the only one able to move was a woman.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But that's not entirely accurate, as it was a peculiar creature. It merely had a beautiful woman's face, and that woman's face was...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dalia?" Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Dalia at this moment, Osborne's eyes widened, as dozens of enormous tentacles had grown out of Dalia's body, waving relentlessly around her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A manic and excited smile spread across her face. Suddenly, a tentacle shot out, instantly piercing through a dozen people sitting on the ground. Those people were from Blossom Cage, including Osborne's acquaintance, Romina.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The tentacle pierced through Romina and the others' chests, unleashing an incredibly terrifying devouring force. Romina and the others' bodies quickly shriveled up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their vital essence, soul power, and potential were swiftly devoured by Dalia in an instant. In the end, they became dried-up corpses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From start to finish, they didn't even let out a single scream.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After they all turned into corpses, Dalia retracted the tentacle and sneered, "You worthless trash are no longer of any use. So, obediently become my nourishment. Now, I can finally start savoring my real feast."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Dalia looked at everyone in the Phantomagic Realm, her eyes filled with excitement and thrill, then couldn't help but stick out her crimson tongue to lick the corner of her mouth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, all her tentacles began to move.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A dozen grotesque, terrifying tentacles instantly spread out, piercing through the chests of more than twenty warriors at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, those tentacles unleashed a terrifying devouring force.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The more than twenty warriors at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, still trapped in the Bewitching Formation, had no reaction at all. Their bodies were swiftly drained, leaving them as dried corpses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation made Osborne take a deep breath, thinking, "The demonic cultivator behind Blossom Cage is actually Dalia. She isn't at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection but at Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
