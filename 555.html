  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At Challenge Peak, on the screen projecting the events of the Branch Bloodline Competition, there was a particular section continuously showing the image of Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone was watching him closely, eager to see when and by whom his Heir's Emblem would be taken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, they saw Osborne activate the Satan's Eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Immediately, many were stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wait, does he really possess the Satan's Eye?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wasn't it said that the branch bloodline in Dampston had lost the ability to awaken the Satan's Eye due to some reasons? Yet, he has it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This means the bloodline of Dampston can still awaken the Satan's Eye."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whispers filled the air as everyone discussed this revelation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nathan, Queenie, and others were also taken aback, their eyes gleaming with excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One of the reasons why the branch bloodline from Dampston wasn't as strong as others was due to the fact that other branches had the resources from the main bloodline.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Another reason was that other branches could awaken the Satan's Eye, but they couldn't.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, seeing Osborne activate it, they were thrilled, believing that if Osborne could do it, they might have a chance as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But only Isaac smiled bitterly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew that Osborne had no real connection to the Dampston branch bloodline. Osborne's ability to awaken the Satan's Eye didn't guarantee the same for them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, he chose to keep this to himself and instead watched the scene with confidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wait a moment! His Satan's Eye seems... different! Look closely&mdash;there are five star light in his eyes, and they're not white, but a faint gold!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What? Faint gold star light?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's a mutated Satan's Eye!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He actually has a mutated Satan's Eye!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, countless envious eyes turned towards Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even members of the main bloodline, including Owen, couldn't help but feel a tinge of jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not even they possessed the mutated Satan's Eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Within the main bloodline, there was only one person whose Satan's Eye had mutated, and that was the young generation's strongest acknowledged member&mdash;Vincent Augustine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent's mutated Satan's Eye was evidently much more powerful than the others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And he was also the Augustine family's most likely candidate to break through to the seventh level of the Satan's Eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was said that an ordinary Satan's Eye could only reach a maximum of six levels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only the mutated Satan's Eye could potentially break through to the seventh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, when everyone realized that Osborne's Satan's Eye was mutated, they were filled with jealousy, even Owen himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn it! That guy has such unbelievable luck!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen cursed under his breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But then he sneered. "But so what if he has a mutated Satan's Eye? He's too weak to become the heir! Without that status, he's no match for me!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Besides, Sam and David won't let him walk away alive!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Owen continued to watch the scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, the battle between Osborne and David suddenly erupted on the screen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone saw David suddenly appear from the shadows, launching a stealthy attack that Osborne couldn't avoid. The black dagger sliced across Osborne's throat, leaving a grotesque wound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone was shocked by the sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isaac, Nathan, and the others jumped to their feet, panicked and alarmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only when they realized Osborne wasn't fatally harmed did they breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They then watched as David disappeared once more. When Osborne couldn't locate him, he prepared to leave through a dimensional rift.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But just as Osborne was about to make his escape, David reappeared, launching another sneak attack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone believed Osborne was finished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, in the next moment, the situation reversed dramatically. Although David managed to injure Osborne again, he was also dealt a severe blow by Osborne, leaving him gravely injured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As everyone waited anxiously to see who would emerge victorious, the drone broadcasting the fight was suddenly destroyed by the shockwaves of their battle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The screen went black, causing an uproar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's going on? The drone got destroyed?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn it, it happened at the most crucial moment! How could the feed just cut out?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who do you think will win?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's definitely going to be David. He's stronger, and his powers are so elusive. If he wants to, he can disappear into the darkness at any moment, and Osborne wouldn't be able to touch him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Exactly! David might be hurt, but I'm sure he'll still come out on top!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I also think David will win!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the discussions continued, two minutes later, a new drone finally arrived at the battlefield, and the screen came back to life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But by then, Osborne was nowhere to be seen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All that remained was a scattering of blood and flesh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instantly, the entire audience fell silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They all knew...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Someone had died.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though it wasn't uncommon for participants to die in the Branch Bloodline Competition, it was the first time that a branch heir had fallen. Everyone knew something significant had occurred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, they didn't even know who had died.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who was it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Was it Osborne?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Or was it David?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone turned their eyes towards the branch bloodlines of Ransford and Dampston.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isaac, Nathan, and the others were visibly horrified, their faces pale with fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In contrast, the members of the Ransford branch remained calm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">An elder leading the Ransford branch sneered coldly, "Of course, the one who died must be Osborne. There's no way David would lose. In the wilderness, he's invincible!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne is already dead!"</p><div class="pagination">
