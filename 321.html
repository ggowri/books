  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Alisa Ship had seventeen decks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bottom two were storage, the third and fourth were crew areas, and the fifth to eighth were for regular passengers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ninth to thirteenth decks were all entertainment zones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Alisa Ship had a plethora of entertainment facilities, making it a mini entertainment kingdom where any service one could imagine was available.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decks fourteenth and fifteenth were for VIP guests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sixteenth and seventeenth decks offered exclusive services like casinos and auctions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and his party stayed on the fifteenth deck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apart from Osborne, Yulissa, Ryan, and Nathan, they also brought along a security team of about thirty people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Additionally, two members of The Wise Order were secretly protecting them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to the low number of passengers, each person had their own suite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Yulissa insisted on sharing a suite with Osborne, and he couldn't refuse. This arrangement also made it easier for him to protect her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Honk!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne entered his room, the Alisa Ship's horn blared loudly. The massive ship slowly set sail from Crescent Wharf, heading into the open sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the plan, the Alisa Ship would sail through the night, leaving the waters of country Rosmandi and entering international waters by morning, offering passengers a stunning sunrise view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, the Augustines' cruise ships always encountered trouble in international waters, so Osborne was relaxed the night the ship went to the international waters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He secluded himself in his room, clutching his blood diamond, and focused on enhancing his strength to prepare for any unforeseen events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night passed quickly,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Alisa Ship became lively as it sailed into the open sea. Despite having less than a third of its capacity filled, all services were available, and guests began to emerge from their rooms, sipping fine wine and watching the sunrise over the ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having never been on a cruise before, Osborne couldn't resist stepping out onto the fifteenth deck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deck was quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, few could afford the nearly million-dollar tickets, especially with the Augustines' cruises frequently encountering issues lately. Wealthy individuals were naturally cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan, Nathan, and Yulissa also came out onto the deck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn, there are too few passengers," Nathan muttered, looking at the empty deck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At this rate, our family business is doomed. Every trip out to sea doesn't even cover the maintenance costs for the ship and crew."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa's face darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan remained calm. "Things will change. I believe our family will overcome this crisis soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, surprised by Ryan's optimism, glanced at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his reduced suspicion of Ryan, he still found him questionable. He hadn't expected Ryan to speak so positively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne added, "Don't worry, Ryan is right. This situation will soon be over. Our ships will carry full passengers and set sail again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once we find and eliminate the mastermind, everything will return to normal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he spoke, everyone turned to look at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what's the plan? What are we supposed to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "You'll find out soon enough. Just be patient."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne's eye twitched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He signaled everyone to stay quiet and looked toward the other end of the deck, where two figures emerged - a man and a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was tall, handsome, and exuded confidence and arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman was beautiful and stern, her expression cold but with a hint of self-assurance in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't recognize them, but Ryan, Yulissa, and Nathan did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their expressions changed, and they tensed as if facing wild beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are they?" Osborne asked in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa's face was serious. "They're from the Paltrow family! The man is Yohan Paltrow, and the woman is Lauren Paltrow. They're among the best of the younger generation in the Paltrow family, and extremely powerful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why would they be on our cruise?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa looked puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Paltrow family?" Osborne raised an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're probably here for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three looked at Osborne in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne had no chance. He noticed that the two members of the Paltrow family had their eyes fixed on him, and he knew that they were up to no good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was not nervous. He took a step forward, protected Yulissa and others behind him, and looked directly at the two of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay calm."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yohan and Lauren stopped twenty feet from Osborne, smiling brightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must be Osborne, the Augustine family's heir?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled calmly, "Yes, I am. What can I do for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yohan grinned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're here to see you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our young heir Mr. Paltrow, has a message for you. Clarissa is destined to be his woman. He hopes you'll be wise enough to give up on her and never see her again."</span></p><div class="pagination">
