"Osborne, your Deadly Force is indeed powerful and effective against me. Since I'm here, do you t</span><span>hink I wouldn't be prepared? I only needed one defensive ancient magic </span><span>weapon to nullify your Deadly Force!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, you're finished!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and looked at him coldly. "Is that so? I don't believe you can block this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne charged forward and threw another punch at Tauren's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tauren was fast but clumsy at turning, even less agile than the Titan. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with Osborne's attack, he could only choose to charge straight on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bull Rush!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's punch once again struck Duke's shield. The force penetrated it and landed on Tauren's tough hide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tauren sneered at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hide had amazing defense, and Osborne's attack couldn't seriously injure him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the next second, Tauren was terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that Osborne's force had hit his hide but didn't cause any damage. Instead, it had penetrated further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, Tauren's body froze in place, completely motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His head had already been turned into a </span><span>pulp</span><span> by Osborne's force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dead beyond any doubt</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was also knocked back by the impact, his body sent flying again as he spat out blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was now filled with a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who told you my Deadly Force could only penetrate one layer of defense? My Deadly Force has reached its extreme level. Even if there are two or three layers of defense, it will still penetrate and kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, the other two Tauren's expressions changed drastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked at Osborne in fear and began to slowly retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered. "Now you think of retreating? Too late! You're next!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Osborne suddenly charged at the second Tauren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Restrain him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tauren shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa heard this. Without any hesitation, she immediately unleashed her special move on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ashes of Death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Buzz!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's charging body instantly froze. The terrifying petrification effect of Ashes of Death turned his body to stone in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attack Now! He can break free from petrification. Kill him before he does!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After using the Ashes of Death special move, she became extremely weak and had to withdraw from the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in her view, there was no need for her to intervene again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two </span><span>Taurens</span><span> stopped retreating and instantly used Bull Rush on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they hit him, Osborne would either die or be seriously injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three Werewolves also didn't hesitate and launched their attacks on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the Werewolves even unleashed his special move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Death Claw!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying attack was hurtling toward Osborne. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Petrified by the Medusa's special move, he couldn't dodge at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Prison!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that moment, the space around Osborne suddenly fluctuated. A 16-foot radius around him turned into a prison, trapping Osborne inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Spatial Prison made it seem like Osborne and the others were in different spatial dimensions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang, bang, bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attacks from the three Werewolves hit the Spatial Prison first, but they couldn't </span><span>harm Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the Spatial Prison shattered because of the power of Werewolves' special move. Death Claw was too strong to hold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, the Spatial Prison bought Osborne enough time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Cross inside his body unleashed a terrifying force, instantly breaking the petrification effect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the two </span><span>Taurens</span><span> charged right in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile appeared on Osborne's face.</span></p><div class="pagination">
