  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's question hung in the air, and both Clarissa and Emma's expressions darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma bit her lip, glancing at Osborne with concern. "Osborne, you need to rest. Don't worry about anything else for now. The elders of the family will handle it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow, sensing the gravity of the situation. "Is it really that bad? Why won't you just tell me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, just tell me what's going on with the Augustine family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne's unwavering determination, Emma finally relented with a reluctant nod. "Alright, I'll tell you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because of that mysterious powerhouse, Rumen and Everett have backed off from the Augustine Estate, but they haven't left. They're just lurking outside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's voice trembled slightly as she continued, "The moment any of us step outside, we'll be attacked immediately. Not to mention the assassins from the Eityreia Organization lurking in the shadows, ready to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the past few days, dozens of our family members have already fallen to their hands! Mr. Wesson Augustine has ordered everyone to stay put for now. We're completely surrounded!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're completely surrounded!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her fists clenched tightly, her face flushed with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here they were, in Rosmandi&mdash;the Augustine family was the oldest and most prestigious family in the region&mdash;but they were being besieged by the League of Divine Descent and the Eityreia Organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't even step outside without risking their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kind of sting was unbearable for any member of the Augustine family, and Emma felt it deeply as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, she found herself powerless to change the situation. With Rumen and Everett&mdash;two top-tier Class S powerhouses&mdash;encircling the Augustine Estate and Sebastian absent, there was simply no one left to stand up against them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face darkened as the weight of her words sank in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're trapped? We can't even leave the Augustine family's territory without being slaughtered?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They deserve to die!" Osborne growled, teeth gritted in rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The urge to charge out and eliminate their enemies surged within him, but he knew better. With his current strength, charging out would be nothing short of suicide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just one of them, like Everett, was more than he could handle, let alone the even stronger Rumen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Osborne forced himself to calm down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma continued, "Also, Mr. Wesson Augustine mentioned that our intelligence department has spotted the Aberrants in the coastal provinces, like Skyefall and Dampston. He believes they're gathering forces for a second wave of attack against us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression grew even more serious at this news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood up, determination etched on his face. "I understand! I need to speak with Mr. Wesson Augustine right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, he found Wesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just one day had passed, but Wesson looked significantly older, his complexion pale and his eyes heavy with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw Osborne, a faint smile flickered across his face, but it quickly turned into a cough, blood staining his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yesterday, he had teamed up with three of Sebastian's maidservants to take on Rumen, but they were still outmatched. Each of them walked away with their fair share of injuries, and none had fully recovered yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather, you're here," Wesson said, wiping the blood away with a shaky hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind him stood eight elderly women, all bowing respectfully to Osborne. "We greet you, Godfather," they said in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were Sebastian's loyal handmaidens, trusted confidantes who were well aware that Osborne had inherited everything from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a deep respect for them and quickly replied, "There's no need for such formalities, esteemed elders. May I ask how you prefer to be addressed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned his gaze to Serena, recognizing her among the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back when he was still weak, she had once helped him, saving his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena quickly smiled and said, "Godfather, let me introduce you to everyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, she had introduced all seven of the women to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Together, they made a formidable group of eight, with three of them having reached Class S strength&mdash;powerhouses on par with Wesson. The other five were top-tier Class AAA members, investing their skills in the family's defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This motley crew was essentially the strongest force under Sebastian's command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Osborne absorbed their names and rank, he turned urgently to Wesson. "Mr. Wesson Augustine, what's the current situation? We need to know exactly what we're up against."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson let out a deep sigh, gathering his thoughts before relaying the details.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His account echoed what Emma had told Osborne but with greater elaboration. Essentially, the Augustine family was trapped, besieged by Rumen, Everett, and a contingent of assassins from the Eityreia Organization. No one could venture outside without risking their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's fists clenched, a fierce glare flashing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Damn it! Rumen! Everett! The League of Divine Descent and the Eityreia Organization! They're pushing their luck!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Aberrants is mobilizing at the borders, preparing for another onslaught. It's almost as if they're coordinating with these factions to wipe out the Augustine family&mdash;and eliminate the Draco Group along with us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson's voice was laced with concern as he spoke, "I fear that might just be their plan. Unfortunately, with the former Godfather gone, we've lost our edge for retaliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it hadn't been for that mysterious powerhouse showing up yesterday, we would have been done for."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, a spark of hope ignited in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Yes! The mysterious powerhouse! The God of Star!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
