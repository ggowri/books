  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yulissa, go call Isaac and Brian over here. I have something very important to tell them," Osborne said to Yulissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa was stunned for a moment, then nodded. "Okay, I'll go call them now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Yulissa left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan said, "Mr. Augustine, since you need to discuss important matters with Isaac, should we leave first?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "No, you should all listen to this together. It has a lot to do with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the other people heard this, they showed excitement on their faces. After all, this meant that they could also participate in the family's major decision-making, which was a recognition of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Isaac and Brian arrived at the suite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac's face was filled with excitement. As soon as he entered the room, he said, "Osborne, we won. Our auction can be held smoothly. Guess who helped us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "It's Bryce, the leader of Likreia Mountain, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You already know that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he said excitedly, "It is indeed Bryce. I didn't expect that he would help our family. He just announced that our family's cruise ship will be protected by Likreia Mountain in the future, and whoever dares to attack us is declaring war on Likreia Mountain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac's body was shaking with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Likreia Mountain is the most powerful pirate organization in this sea area. With their protection, no one in this sea area dares to attack our cruise ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even the Luther family, the Paltrow family, and the Walker family won't dare to do that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, we won't have to worry about accidents in this sea area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know why Bryce helped us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We don't know him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Isaac's words, everyone was shocked with excitement and surprise on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was also a little surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce had done him another big favor, and he owed Bryce even more now. Bryce might not care about his return at all, so...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he could do was take good care of Kendra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "Isaac, this is indeed good news. At least the Maritime Auction will be held smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, I called you here because I have something good to tell you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac calmed down and asked, "What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian also looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan, Ryan, Kaden, Queenie and others all looked at Osborne curiously, wondering what good news he was going to announce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "I think I have found the traitor in the Augustine family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? There's a traitor in our family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan and Queenie both exclaimed. They didn't know that there was a traitor in the Augustine family and Osborne had been secretly investigating the traitor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only ones who knew about this were Isaac and Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac's expression turned serious at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said seriously, "Osborne, are you sure?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "I have indeed found him out. I am about 90% sure, and I don't want to wait any longer. I want to expose him now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, his identity is somewhat special, and I am a little afraid to say it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac's face turned cold. "Osborne, you can speak boldly. Who is the traitor in the Augustine family? I promise you that no matter who he is, I will never let him off easily. No matter how high his status is, I will never tolerate him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian also nodded. "Osborne, tell us. Even if the traitor is my son, I will never forgive him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Brian's words, Nathan was shocked. "Dad, don't scare me. I'm not a traitor. I've never betrayed the Augustine family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian glared at him. "I was just using you as an example. I didn't say you were the traitor. Why are you so excited? The more you act like this, the more I doubt you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan was helpless. "Dad, am I your biological son? I just said a few words to defend myself, but you doubted me even more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" Brian scolded Nathan and looked at Osborne again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, please tell us who is the traitor in our family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right. Osborne, please tell us now," Yulissa said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan, Ryan, Queenie, and Kaden all urged Osborne to tell them who the traitor was, and everyone had a look of anger on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly. He glanced at them and finally looked at Ryan, who also had a look of indignation on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said calmly, "Ryan, if I'm not mistaken, you are the traitor, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, the room suddenly became quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at Ryan in disbelief, with shock on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac trembled because Ryan was his grandson.</span></p><div class="pagination">
