  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Two young women in their twenties? They did appear, but not by choice. They were taken by Dark Deity from outside!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was startled.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you talking about?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Calm down," God of Star said. "They're not in immediate danger."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He continued, "When you last visited, I told you this place is a deity's tomb from the Age of Gods, belonging to a rather unremarkable god.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, that unremarkable god is me!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Long ago, gods from other worlds came here, intending to enslave all life on Earth.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Our own deities couldn't accept being enslaved and fought back.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And that's how the divine war started!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This place was one of the battlefields. My opponent was incredibly powerful, far stronger than I was. I had no choice but to imprison myself, severely injuring that evil spirit and trapping it in eternal sleep here!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I drained the energy from this place, turning it into a barren wasteland, hoping Dark Deity would never recover.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But despite the long years, while it remained asleep, its power has been slowly regenerating."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Until three days ago, when it finally awoke!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was stunned.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew this story, but he had always thought it was just a prank by Isa, who had been playing tricks on him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frowning, Osborne asked cautiously, "Isa, is this another of your jokes?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">God of Star fell silent.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a pause, he said, "I understand if you're skeptical. But if you head east, you'll eventually find me."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's frown deepened.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although he still suspected it might be Isa's trickery, he nodded and started walking east.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the barren, echoing world, sounds began to faintly emerge. Osborne wasn't sure how long he'd walked, but he finally reached a vast, empty room.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the center of the room, a hazy, ancient figure sat weakly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was stunned when he saw it.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now do you believe me? I'm a fragment of God of Star. I no longer have a physical form. This is my tomb. I've been here for so long that I've lost track."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The ancient shadow's voice was frail and faint.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was silent, his mind reeling. He could feel a terrifyingly powerful force emanating from the shadow.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This power felt almost identical to the energy he'd sensed from the Divine Bone Crystal.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Divine Power!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, while the Divine Bone Crystal's power was pure and attribute-less, the God of Star's power clearly carried light elemental.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You really are God of Star? A deity from the Age of Gods?" Osborne asked, his amazement evident.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though Osborne had grown increasingly convinced of the existence of deities as his own power developed, he'd never actually seen one.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, a real deity was right in front of him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">God of Star managed a weak smile. "In my current state, I'm hardly a god. Even a lesser deity could probably defeat me now!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A lesser deity was only at Class S.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's expression grew serious. Despite his astonishment at encountering a real deity, he hadn't forgotten why he was here.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He quickly asked, "You said the Dark Deity has woken up? Is it the one who took the two girls?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">God of Star nodded vigorously.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, it was him! He used his divine power to snatch the girls right from above. As soon as he woke, he wounded me severely. To regain his strength, he needs to consume more blood energy.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's capturing the girls to absorb their blood energy and recover!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But don't worry too much. He's injured and can't absorb their blood energy right now. However, if he recovers even a bit more, the girls will be in serious danger!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's an evil spirit from beyond. If he consumes their blood energy, his power will grow rapidly! If he absorbs the girls' blood energy, both you and I will be at risk!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He'll kill us, then escape and start devouring the blood energy of living beings to quickly regain his strength!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"At that point, few will be able to stop him!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, you need to act fast. Kill him now, while he's still weak. Eliminate him permanently!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The gravity of God of Star's words shook Osborne to his core.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The deity was asking him to kill another god.</p><div class="pagination">
