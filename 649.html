The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' defenses in the rare metal mining area are weak. The squads can finish in minutes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My ranking in the standings will soon be at the top!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen's excitement grew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after several minutes, he still hadn't received good news. His points only increased by ten occasionally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Osborne frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The slight increase means the squads have started attacking and taken down a few Class A enemies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But why haven't they resolved the battle and taken back the rare metal mining areas?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be anxious. Maybe they will succeed soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen continued to wait.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after another ten minutes, he still hadn't received any good news. He felt anxious, sensing something was wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the three sneak attack squads reported back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> have at least three Class AAs, three Class A+s, and nearly ten Class As guarding the mining area!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our intelligence was wrong. We were ambushed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've suffered heavy losses and can't hold out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A member of the sneak attack squads shouted in an anxious voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen's face turned pale. "How is that possible? You must be mistaken!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He roared </span><span>angrily,</span><span> his cheeks turned extremely red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as more grim news arrived, he realized they were not wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each squad faced overwhelming odds, with at least three enemy Class AAs defending each area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under such circumstances, the sneak attack squads seemed to have walked into a trap. As soon as the battle broke out, they were immediately at an absolute disadvantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they could occasionally kill the enemy, their own losses were greater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After about ten minutes of fighting, most of them were wiped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The few survivors sent brief messages before being overwhelmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen understood they were all dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is it possible?" he exclaimed, disoriented by the heavy losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were six Class AA members in the three sneak attack squads, and the support forces behind him only had a total of more than twenty Class AA members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The loss was too heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen could hardly accept it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, he had dismissed warnings about the risks of the sneak attack, and now he had to bear the consequences alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He collapsed onto the sofa, while those around him fell silent, their faces grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The losses were catastrophic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Owen suddenly shouted, "This is Osborne's fault!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He gave me wrong information. The force of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> guarding the rare metal mining area is far stronger than what he said!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it weren't for him, I wouldn't have taken this risk and lost so many experts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face twisted with rage as he blamed Osborne for the operation's failure.</span></p><div class="pagination">
