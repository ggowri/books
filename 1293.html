  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence scoffed derisively at Osborne, his arrogance radiating off of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A trump card? I'm curious to see what you've got that could possibly measure up to the twenty-nine Transcendent Deities of the Deschanel Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope your secret weapon packs a punch; we wouldn't want this to end too quickly, would we? That would just disappoint me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he wore an indifferent expression, as if the outcome was already decided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Deschanel Clan looked on with mocking smiles at Divine Shadow and Osborne; their disdain was evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow's frustration boiled over. "Kid, are you going to show us your trump card or what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled awkwardly. "Hold on, Grandma Divine Shadow. If they want to see my card, let's give them a show."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his hand dramatically, and suddenly, the skies split open, creating a massive dimensional rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Figures began to emerge, stepping out one after another with purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon members had arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fully armed and with steely expressions, they emerged from the rift, standing strong and unwavering in the face of the Deschanel Clan's twenty-nine Transcendent Deity warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their numbers grew larger&mdash;ten, then a hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Deschanel Clan exchanged glances, their laughter echoing through the air as they took in the sight of Junior Deities emerging from the rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them couldn't help but chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this really the ace up your sleeve, the Augustine family? A bunch of Junior Deities? You think they can take on our Transcendent Deity elders and leader?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laughter erupted around them. "This is priceless! Using Junior Deities against us? It's like throwing eggs against a rock&mdash;sheer madness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Any of our Transcendent Deity elders or leader could take them down without breaking a sweat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What once might have been worry about Osborne's trump card was now replaced with condescension as the Deschanel Clan reveled in their perceived superiority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence grinned, mocking their display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this really your secret weapon? I'm deeply disappointed! Sure, it's impressive that each one boasts a Level Three or higher Divine Body, but at the end of the day, a Junior Deity is still just a Junior Deity, nothing more than insects in front of Transcendent Deity warriors."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words provoked a chorus of laughter from the other warriors in the clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were brimming with confidence and pride as they looked down on the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence said, "Junior Deities?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In our eyes, they're nothing but ants! We wouldn't even bother lifting a finger against them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence continued, "However, we've got to admit the Augustine family has a big secret. Each of their divine warriors having a Level Three Divine Body is something unbelievable! But do they really think that's enough to stand up to a full-on assault from the Deschanel Clan? They might as well be asking for a death wish!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even hundreds of Junior Deities stand no chance against just one Transcendent Deity. But this secret of granting at least a Level Three Divine Body to each warrior could be incredibly useful for us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we could uncover that secret, the Deschanel Clan's power would skyrocket! So, I suppose waking up early wasn't such a bad idea after all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nods of agreement rippled through the members of the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's wipe out the Augustine family and seize that secret for ourselves!" one of the Deschanel Clan members exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! Crush them!" another shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Relying on a bunch of Junior Deities as their trump card is downright hilarious!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the scornful laughter rang out, Divine Shadow's anger churned within her like a storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glared at Osborne, who stood beside her, brimming with confidence as if he held the ultimate secret weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This all you have?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, are you pulling my leg? You actually think you can launch a counterattack against the Deschanel Clan and keep your cool in the face of twenty-nine Transcendent Deities with just these Junior Deities?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow's voice trembled with rage as she gestured angrily toward the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the group had swelled to over a hundred, and they kept coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, their numbers would approach two hundred. But so what?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with two hundred Junior Deities, they'd barely manage to take down a few Superior Deities. To think they could pose a threat to the Transcendent Deities was nothing short of delusional!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Easy there, Grandma Divine Shadow! No need to panic!" Osborne said, a trace of embarrassment creeping into his demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was his first time establishing a two-way dimensional portal, with one end right there and the other hundreds of miles away at the Augustine Bastion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This setup allowed him to teleport back to the bastion in a flash, while Blood Demon members could also quickly make their way to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since it was his first attempt, Osborne wasn't quite adept yet, and the portal wasn't very wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only ten Blood Demon members could pass through at once, which meant they were coming through at a snail's pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the Deschanel Clan hadn't launched an attack yet; they seemed to be biding their time, waiting to capture all of Osborne's cards in one go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they had decided to strike early, it would have posed quite a headache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't panic? How can I not? What's your real trump card? Don't tell me it's just these Junior Deities!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow was nearly at her wit's end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said with a grin, "Of course, there's more to it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Some of the Blood Demon members have already broken through to Intermediate Deity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Intermediate Deity?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Divine Shadow's jaw dropped in disbelief.</span></p><div class="pagination">
