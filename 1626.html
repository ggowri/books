  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne muttered to himself, brow furrowed, "He'll go mad? I can't let that happen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The thought of Riley descending into madness was a disturbing one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Riley was a mid-stage Deity Overlord, a member of the Upper Race Soaring Lion Clan. If anything happened to him, it could provoke a thorough investigation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if no solid evidence linked Osborne to Riley's fate, the Soaring Lion Clan would likely hunt him down relentlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That would spell trouble he wanted to avoid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, transforming Riley into a member of the Blood Clan was far preferable to allowing him to lose his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a determined look, Osborne decided he had to wake Riley up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But his plan left Diana stunned. She quickly grabbed his arm, urgency in her voice. "Osborne, don't be reckless! If we do nothing, he's done for! If you wake him up, he won't be grateful; he'll attack you! He's a mid-stage Deity Overlord&mdash;far too powerful for us to handle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We should find a place to hide until he loses his self-control&mdash;then he'll likely head toward Divine Peak Nine and won't come back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was clearly agitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled reassuringly, "Relax! I know he's a Deity Overlord, but he's alone now, and I have confidence I can manage him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If he loses control and disappears, it will raise suspicion, and there will definitely be an investigation! It's better to keep him alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana froze at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "Osborne is confident he could deal with Riley?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Riley's a mid-stage Deity Overlord!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But then Diana recalled how Osborne had effortlessly defeated two early-stage Deity Overlord guards, using some special means to turn them into fiercely loyal subjects. A thought began to form in her mind, one that left her excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Maybe Osborne really can handle Riley?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne beats him&mdash;even controls him&mdash;wouldn't that change our situation for the better?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A flicker of hope danced in her eyes as she voiced her concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, are you sure about this? A mid-stage Deity Overlord is a whole different league! I'm worried..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne interrupted her with a chuckle, "Don't sweat it! Sure, I've never gone toe-to-toe with a mid-stage Deity Overlord before, but I've got a good feeling about this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Plus, he's trapped in a hallucination right now, totally unaware of what's happening around him. I'm not going to handle this gently; I'll wake him up in a rough way&mdash;like giving him a good splash of cold reality!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Say, maybe a knockout punch to keep him from striking back. I need to get to him now, though, or he'll sink deeper into madness and completely lose himself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Diana finally seemed convinced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She bit her lip, her resolve wavering just a bit. "Just... be careful, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath as he approached Riley. The mid-stage Deity Overlord's face was twisted in torment, and Osborne felt the gravity of the situation. Training so close to Divine Peak Nine was perilous, as he was witnessing firsthand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even someone as powerful as Riley could hardly wake from such a nightmare without help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Riley had always had Emmett and his crew ready to pull him from danger, ensuring he never faced dire consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, with Emmett dead at Osborne's own hands, most of Riley's followers eliminated, and the rest transformed into Blood Clan members, Riley was utterly lost in that horrific illusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne didn't intervene, Riley would soon spiral into complete madness, losing his grip on reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The end result? A raving lunatic rampaging toward Divine Peak Nine, never to return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could feel that Riley was on the brink of a mental breakdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, he sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was no way he'd softly rouse Riley from his nightmare; instead, he unleashed a powerful attack straight at the defenseless Deity Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a thunderous crash, the blast sent Riley hurtling through the air, blood erupting from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even as a mid-stage Deity Overlord, he was completely unprepared for Osborne's relentless strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The force of the impact left Riley gravely injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If not for the Malevolence Amulet he wore, which absorbed much of the onslaught, his divine power essence would have been utterly obliterated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Riley's body slammed violently against the wall, eliciting a pained scream. The sheer agony jolted him awake, yanking him out of his hallucination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Riley's eyes focused, he found Osborne standing before him, a cold smile etched across Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rage surged within Riley as he roared, "You lowly scum of the Human Community! You dared to ambush me? Where's Emmett? Where is my crew? How could you let this happen? Kill him&mdash;now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clearly, Riley was still grappling with his disorienting circumstances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stepped closer, his voice calm and measured. "Riley, there's no need to scream. Your people are either dead or have pledged their loyalty to me. And now, it's your turn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Osborne had no intention of wasting more breath on idle chatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He threw another punch, this one even more devastating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Riley, still recovering from the initial blow, found himself unable to evade Osborne's attack. The punch connected with the force of a freight train, shattering what little divine power essence he had left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that instant, Riley froze, stunned by the realization.</span></p><div class="pagination">
