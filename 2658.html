  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the blink of an eye, a day had passed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne finished his training. Soon after, Clara, Leroy, and Casey also completed theirs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, each of them was dressed in a beautiful snow-white battle armor. The armor fully enveloped their bodies, radiating the energy of a Legendary Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clearly, the three of them had already mastered the Legendary Sacred Artifact Armor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the armor on, their defense became incredibly strong. Although they were only at primary Empyrean Sacredness, even a warrior at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, or even Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, couldn't easily break through their defense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, the Legendary Sacred Artifact consumed their Sacred Power significantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the three of them took off their armor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara said, "If I use all my Sacred Power for defense, I can probably last two hours. If I fight while defending, my Sacred Power will be depleted quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, I'll keep the armor stored away usually and only use it when facing overwhelming danger."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, Leroy nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her strength was similar to Clara's, and she couldn't wear the armor all the time. Otherwise, her Sacred Power would be exhausted in just two hours.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Casey was slightly weaker. "Even if I focus entirely on defense, my Sacred Power can barely last an hour. However, since it's Legendary Sacred Artifact Armor, it provides full protection. If I really face danger, it will definitely save my life."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "Your cultivation level is too low. Once you reach advanced Empyrean Sacredness, you won't need to worry about the energy consumption of the Legendary Sacred Artifact Armor. By then, you can wear the armor anytime, anywhere, without fearing ambushes."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara, Leroy, and Casey all nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They certainly knew it was because their cultivation level was too low.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara said, "But improving cultivation level isn't that easy. Especially after reaching Empyrean Sacredness, if we want to keep breaking through, it takes decades, centuries, or even millennia. By the time we reach advanced Empyrean Sacredness, it will probably be at least a few hundred years later."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, the three of them looked at Osborne with some envy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before entering Celestial Spire, although Osborne was powerful, he was at the same cultivation level as them. However, after reaching Empyrean Sacredness, they were only at primary Empyrean Sacredness, while Osborne had already reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's cultivation speed was simply terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Will it take you hundreds of years to reach advanced Empyrean Sacredness? Not necessarily." Osborne smiled and pointed at the Eighth Skyfall Casket, saying, "You might reach advanced Empyrean Sacredness very soon. In fact, if you're a bit lucky, your cultivation level might surpass mine."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Clara, Leroy, and Casey immediately widened their eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How is that possible?" Clara, Leroy, and Casey said simultaneously, all in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why is it impossible?" Osborne said, "Don't forget how the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet suddenly emerged tens of thousands of years ago. They obtained the key to the Ninth Skyfall Casket in the Celestial Spire and then entered the Ninth Skyfall Casket together.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Eventually, when the twelve of them emerged from the Ninth Skyfall Casket, nine had already reached Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, or even Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness. The other three were even more formidable, becoming true warriors at Imperial Empyrean Sacredness. On the Racial Convergence Planet, no one could defeat them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This shows that the opportunities within the Skyfall Casket are immense, even beyond our imagination. Otherwise, Frederick wouldn't be so excited. So, after entering the Skyfall Casket, your cultivation level has a chance to rise rapidly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In short, once Ms. Alba finishes her cultivation, we'll enter the Eighth Skyfall Casket. I believe each of us will achieve great advancements."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara, Leroy, and Casey immediately became excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But after a while, they still had doubts. Leroy said, "Is the Skyfall Casket really that powerful? The Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet must have been like us before entering the Celestial Spire, not yet reaching Empyrean Sacredness. Even if they enhanced their strength in the Celestial Spire, they, like us, were only at primary Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Did they really reach Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, or even directly achieve Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, just by entering the Skyfall Casket once?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shrugged and said, "That I don't know. After all, this happened nearly a hundred thousand years ago. There might be some exaggeration in this matter, but we can no longer verify the truth. However, the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom does indeed have the notes left by Solomon."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The strength of The Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet did indeed improve rapidly in the Skyfall Casket. There's no doubt about that. Frederick's current performance also proves this. The Skyfall Casket not only boosts our cultivation level and strength quickly but also provides a way for warriors like Frederick, who are at Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, to break through their limits and reach Imperial Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne's expression turned serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In order to survive, he was forced to open the Eighth Skyfall Casket and let Frederick enter it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps Frederick might truly become a warrior at Imperial Empyrean Sacredness because of this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If such a situation truly occurs, Osborne's path to revenge will be very troublesome.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I'll first enter the Skyfall Casket to check the situation. I must try to stop Frederick from reaching Imperial Empyrean Sacredness. If I can't, then I'll do my best to enhance my own strength."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as I am strong enough, even if Frederick reaches Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, I can defeat him and then kill him to avenge my mother from my past life."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes were filled with determination as he thought, "Even if Frederick escapes to the depths of the cosmos, I will never let him go. Even if I have to turn the entire cosmos upside down, I will find him and kill him to avenge my mother."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, why are you so familiar with the situation of the Royal Family?" Adriana's voice sounded at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana had finally finished her training.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was now clad in a dazzling, ornate set of Imperial Artifact Armor, every inch of it radiating power and splendor. Only her face was visible beneath the armor&mdash;and she looked breathtaking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at Osborne curiously and asked, "Osborne, have you read Solomon's notes? You seem to know a lot about the Royal Family. Why do you have a grudge against the Royal Family?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression turned serious. In the end, he still didn't answer and simply said, "Ms. Alba, you might find out soon enough. But for now, let's not waste time. We're already a day behind. Since we're ready, let's head in quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Realizing Osborne didn't want to answer, Adriana gave up asking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She nodded and said, "Then let's set off. Your cultivation level is too low. If you encounter others, you'll be in great danger. So, you must be extremely careful inside. Safety first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright." The others all nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana continued, "Let's go."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, they all rushed toward the crack of the Eighth Skyfall Casket, quickly entering it and disappearing from Necropolis City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne felt he had entered into darkness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't see anything, only felt like his body was performing Phantom Steps. He had no control over his own body and couldn't sense anything around him, including Adriana, May, Clara, Leroy, and Casey.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After an unknown amount of time, Osborne suddenly felt a light appear before his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He emerged from the darkness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was standing on a pile of ruins, surrounded by collapsed buildings. Roaring sounds filled his ears, and terrifying forces surged around him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne used Sacred Power to shield his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly took off, flying out of the ruins, and finally saw his surroundings clearly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne froze.</span></p><div class="pagination">
