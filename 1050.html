  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Ophelia left, Isa appeared in a flash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knelt beside the unconscious Osborne, her fingers gently brushing against his cheek, a flicker of concern crossing her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa murmured, "Osborne, you won&rsquo;t be mad at me for not saving you sooner, will you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These past few days must have been a hell for you. After all, that was level 18 pain! Even when I helped you fuse the soul of powers, it was only level 16!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But this is an opportunity for you&mdash;a chance to grow faster! It&rsquo;s an extreme method, even considered taboo in the Age of Gods. No one dares to try it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't intervene right away because I wanted to see how far you could push yourself. I never expected you to hold on this long...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope you don't blame me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she caressed Osborne's face, a faint crimson energy flowed from her fingertips into his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the leftover energy from the cultivation fluid; we can't waste it! You need to grow stronger quickly. The God of Time has already restored herself to Class AAA and is about to reach Class S!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once she hits Class S, the world's time will completely reset. Everything will </span><span>change, and I need your help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Isa lifted Osborne's body into her arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This place isn't safe enough. Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, both Isa and Osborne vanished from the cave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Ophelia had just returned to her training room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo remained frozen in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His formidable Class S power overshadowed Ophelia's, but he had been drained after extracting the heart's blood from Goddess Medusa twice in the last three days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That weakness was why he couldn't break Ophelia's time freeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ophelia settled back into her rhythm, her time freeze broke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' base returned to its formal state, with everyone resuming their tasks, completely unaware that they had been frozen for a full three minutes. But the doctors in the Human Slave cultivation chamber couldn&rsquo;t continue because they found something was wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a blink of confusion, their surroundings shifted from perfectly intact to utter chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hundreds of cultivation tanks stood empty, and all the subjects who were undergoing the slave transformation had vanished&mdash;including Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They rubbed their eyes in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But reality hit hard; every single Human Slave was gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic washed over them, their faces paling as they quickly hit the alarm button.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the piercing sound of alarms echoed throughout the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo, who had been instructing Ophelia and hadn't sensed anything amiss, felt his heart sink at the sound of the alarms. His expression shifted from calm to furious as he dashed out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia followed closely behind, her heart racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo soon reached the Human Slave cultivation chamber. His eyes widened in shock as he saw the empty tanks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell happened?!" Gerardo roared with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying power erupted from him, making the doctors tremble and buckle at the knees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No... no, we don't know!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your Majesty, we just blinked, and suddenly all the Human Slaves vanished! It's got nothing to do with us; we didn't do anything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The surveillance footage will prove our innocence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They pleaded, their voices rising in panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's furious, but he forced himself to calm down. He quickly scanned the surveillance footage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clean. Nothing happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, when time froze, the cameras had also stopped working.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The footage showed the Human Slaves disappearing in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is..." Gerardo squinted at the screen and turned sharply to Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ophelia was as shocked as he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought to herself, "I only took Osborne away! Why did all the Human Slaves disappear?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I remember they were just here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hundreds of them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could they just vanish?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt something just happened, but she didn&rsquo;t catch it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's gaze fell on Ophelia, noticing her astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His brow furrowed in suspicion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Not her? With her abilities, she shouldn't be able to make hundreds of Human Slaves disappear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn&rsquo;t need to do that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What on earth happened here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He&rsquo;s furious than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They can't have gone far! Everyone, go! Go find them!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
