  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The scary force rushed at Stuart, and his face changed in a flash.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He hadn't figured out how to use a domain yet, so he couldn't handle such a powerful attack. He felt like a tiny boat in a huge ocean, about to be smashed by any wave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Right then, he really felt how much stronger Andrew was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But just as it looked bad, Osborne's tall figure stepped in front of him again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bam!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne threw a punch, breaking Andrew's scary attack. The force made him stumble back a few steps, and his face went a bit pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he managed to block it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew's face changed, and he said coldly, "An AA class with that much power? Think you can still fight in my Water Domain?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, well! No wonder you beat Roger! Too bad, you only won because of your strong sixth sense that messed up his sneaky tricks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But against me, your sixth sense is useless! You're just AA-class trash. I can take you out easy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Andrew got ready to attack again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmph!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne&nbsp;snorted coldly and said, "You want to kill me? I doubt you have the ability!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Spatial!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Domain!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Buzz!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant,&nbsp;Osborne&nbsp;activated his&nbsp;Spatial Domain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The only thing that can counter a domain is another domain!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment,&nbsp;Osborne&nbsp;was within&nbsp;Andrew's Water Domain, his power greatly restricted, while&nbsp;Andrew&nbsp;was getting a massive boost. Fighting him in this situation was unwise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew's&nbsp;strength wasn't that of a typical&nbsp;AAA-class.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ranked 465 on the&nbsp;Global Godson Rankings,&nbsp;Andrew&nbsp;was far stronger than a regular&nbsp;AAA-class, even without a domain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it had been yesterday,&nbsp;Osborne&nbsp;would have been unsure of his chances against someone like&nbsp;Andrew. Even if he could handle it, he'd have to reveal many of his hidden cards, possibly even exposing his identity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled. Last night, he had mastered both the&nbsp;Spatial and&nbsp;Light Domain, and now he could use&nbsp;Andrew's&nbsp;strength to test out the power of his domains.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The&nbsp;Spatial Domain&nbsp;unfolded in an instant!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two domains overlapped, sparking an intense collision.&nbsp;Osborne's&nbsp;Spatial Domain, still freshly mastered, was not yet stable and began to collapse under the clash.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hahaha!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew&nbsp;laughed loudly. "An&nbsp;AA class,&nbsp;and you've already mastered a domain? Impressive, but too bad your level is too low and your domain is too weak!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Shatter!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew&nbsp;unleashed his power, trying to shatter&nbsp;Osborne's&nbsp;Spatial Domain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmph!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne&nbsp;snorted coldly as his mental strength surged, stabilizing his&nbsp;Spatial Domain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though his domain wasn't stable,&nbsp;Osborne's&nbsp;mental strength was overwhelming, far stronger than&nbsp;Andrew's. He kept reinforcing his crumbling domain, miraculously holding off&nbsp;Andrew's&nbsp;attack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew&nbsp;realized he couldn't fully destroy&nbsp;Osborne's&nbsp;domain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How is this possible?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew&nbsp;was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew his&nbsp;Water Domain&nbsp;had already evolved once, which was why he could easily shatter&nbsp;Rhett's&nbsp;Fire Domain&nbsp;and defeat him with ease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, he couldn't break&nbsp;Osborne's&nbsp;Spatial Domain?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was insane!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew's&nbsp;expression became serious, though he didn't panic. While he couldn't break&nbsp;Osborne's&nbsp;domain, neither could&nbsp;Osborne&nbsp;do anything about his&nbsp;Water Domain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although both had domains, his had evolved once, making it a&nbsp;level two Domain, which gave him more power.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In this situation, he could still win.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Die!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew&nbsp;stopped targeting&nbsp;Osborne's&nbsp;Spatial Domain&nbsp;and instead used the boost from his&nbsp;Water Domain&nbsp;to launch an attack directly at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that point, the two domains had completely overlapped, meaning neither could overpower the other. Both were free from each other's suppression, relying on their own domains to enhance their power for battle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, it was a contest of the techniques within each domain!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The greatest advantage of the&nbsp;Water Domain&nbsp;was its ability to restrict the enemy and enhance the user's strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew&nbsp;summoned a terrifying force, unleashing it wildly toward&nbsp;Osborne, but&nbsp;Osborne&nbsp;remained calm, a faint smirk on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whoosh!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, his body vanished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Within the&nbsp;Spatial Domain,&nbsp;Osborne&nbsp;was like a god of space. He could use&nbsp;Spatial Powers&nbsp;freely, moving quickly and expending little energy. No matter how powerful&nbsp;Andrew's&nbsp;attacks were, there was no way to hit him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That's because&nbsp;Spatial Teleportation&nbsp;was naturally this powerful!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's&nbsp;body flickered across the arena repeatedly.&nbsp;Andrew's attacks were fast and powerful, but they couldn't touch him at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Immediately,&nbsp;Andrew's&nbsp;face darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He let out a low growl, cursing, "Damn this&nbsp;Spatial Domain! How am I supposed to fight when he keeps teleporting everywhere?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew's&nbsp;eyes were filled with seriousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne&nbsp;smiled lightly, teasing, "Is this already too much for you,&nbsp;Andrew? I haven't even shown you the true power of the&nbsp;Spatial Domain&nbsp;yet."</p><div class="pagination">
