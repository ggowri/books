  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gripped the Trident of Poseidon tightly, feeling its immense power coursing through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne sensed a profound connection with the vast ocean, as if every wave and current was under his command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This exhilarating feeling sent shivers down his spine, igniting a fierce battle spirit within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca, noticing the shift in Osborne's demeanor, furrowed his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! No one, aside from Bryce, can truly harness the power of the Trident of Poseidon! In your hands, it's no more effective than a run-of-the-mill divine artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think you can defeat me with that? Dream on! Once I take you down, I'll drag the Fatebearer back with me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing can stop me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Luca tightened his grip on his divine artifact, the massive axe, and began to gather his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The axe glimmered ominously with dark energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This axe is one of the legendary three axes of Hermes, the river god! The golden axe commands life, the silver axe wields thunder, and the bronze axe embodies raw power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And this one? It's the bronze axe!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It commands strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With a single swing, I could cleave mountains in two! You should feel honored to die by my hand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mountain Splitter!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca roared, raising the colossal axe high above his head before bringing it crashing down toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer force unleashed from the axe formed a blade that stretched hundreds of yards long, capable of splitting even the mightiest mountains in half.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, the winds howled, and the sky darkened ominously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying power of Luca's strike filled the air with dread, leaving both Osborne and Clarissa momentarily paralyzed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt as if the very fabric of reality had been locked down, leaving them with no choice but to face this attack head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's face paled, but instead of fear, her expression was one of concern for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, holding the Trident of Poseidon, sensed the impending doom of Luca's attack and let out a cold snort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mountain Splitter, huh? So what if you can cleave mountains? Can you split the endless ocean?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're the one who's going to die here, not me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Raging Sea!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce grip on the Trident, Osborne summoned the power of the ocean. Waves surged violently, forming a towering wall of water that loomed behind him, reaching dozens of feet high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thrust the Trident forward with all his might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tremendous force surged through Osborne, channeling into the Trident of Poseidon, creating a monstrous waterspout that charged toward Luca's axe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the world fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clash between Luca's axe and the waterspout erupted with a deafening roar. In an instant, the seemingly indomitable axe blade was shattered by the relentless power of the ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waterspout, undeterred, surged forward, aiming straight for Luca.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca's eyes widened in disbelief, fear etched across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! This can't be happening!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could you possibly harness the power of the Trident of Poseidon? No! It's impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca's frantic screams echoed in vain as the waterspout engulfed him, unleashing a cataclysmic force that tore his body apart, leaving nothing but a void where he once stood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne coughed up a mouthful of blood and could no longer hold onto the Trident of Poseidon. He collapsed heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The immense power of his last attack, the Raging Sea, had drained every bit of his strength&mdash;both physical and mental&mdash;leaving him as weak as an ordinary person, unable to even stand on the water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Clarissa reacted quickly, catching him in her arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, are you alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was etched with concern. The sheer force Osborne had unleashed with the Trident of Poseidon had stunned her, but she knew all too well the toll such power took on the body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She frantically used divine healing, trying to restore him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's complexion began to improve, and he managed a faint smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, I'm fine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief scan of the surroundings, he saw there were no more enemies left standing. He relaxed completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We won!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, we won!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in Clarissa's eyes as she nodded vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, yes, Osborne, we won!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't speak yet. Rest up and recover."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cradling Osborne, Clarissa carried him back to the island, settling him on a flat rock. Osborne took a deep breath and began to restore his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After ten minutes, he had regained some of his energy and immediately stood up, transforming into his Vampire form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He began to absorb the rich blood energy around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over twenty Class AAA fighters had perished here, leaving an overwhelming amount of blood energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Absorbing this energy would undoubtedly enhance Osborne's strength and make his Blood Cross even more formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His power would rise once more.</span></p><div class="pagination">
