  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next up, we have Osborne from the Mystic Sirius Sect squaring off against Clara from Fantasia Isle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The announcer's voice thundered through the arena, sparking a flurry of excitement and hushed conversations among the spectators.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne froze for a split second, caught off-guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his book, only two competitors in the top sixteen were truly formidable&mdash;Leroy from the Azure Haven Academy, a front-runner for the title, and Clara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The latter hadn't yet revealed her full might, leaving many in the dark about her true potential. Some saw her as a strong candidate for a top-five finish, while others were </span><span>skeptical</span><span> she'd even make it that far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne was in the know; Clara's power dwarfed that of both Marreese and Tyson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Clara wielded Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never thought he'd be up against Clara so early on, but there was no room for hesitation. To clinch victory in the city duel, he'd have to take down every opponent in his path, be it Leroy or Clara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne got to his feet and made his way to the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There, Clara was already striding towards him with a self-assured swagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here we go again&mdash;another battle for the ages!" someone in the crowd hollered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clara's a force to be reckoned with and a real threat for a top-five finish! She's the dark horse hailing from Fantasia Isle! And don't write off Osborne just yet&mdash;he's the underdog from the Mystic Sirius Sect!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a real clash of the dark horses!" a spectator exclaimed, clearly relishing the thrill of the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still, I'm backing Clara! Her divine artifact, that iron chain, is the stuff of legends. Once you're caught in it, there's no escape&mdash;those who get shackled might as well throw in the towel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne wields a pretty fearsome divine artifact, a bow with some serious firepower. But Clara's bound to have a way to deal with it!" someone else retorted, the discussions heating up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of this commotion seemed to rattle the two combatants in the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara fixed her steely gaze on Osborne, her expression dead serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, her voice resolute, "I can sense your strength. They're underestimating you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne responded with a gentle smile, "I sense the same about you. Believe me, they have no idea what you're truly capable of."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara nodded, a fierce glint lighting up her eyes. "Then let's end this once and for all! Let's find out who's truly the stronger one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne flashed a grin, his resolve hardening. "Let's get it on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he tightened his grip on the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara conjured a massive iron chain that unfurled to nearly thirty feet in length. It coiled around her body, exuding a distinct, otherworldly energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was spatial energy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne realized, suddenly grasping Clara's identity as a spatial power wielder. Half of the chain was present in the real world, while the other half had slipped into the Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you ready?" Clara shouted, her voice brimming with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Without a doubt," Osborne replied, his composure unshaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here we go!" Clara sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the chain seemed to come to life, hurtling through the air at a speed that left everyone breathless. Before Osborne could even raise his bow, the chain slithered around him, tightening with terrifying speed and precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By this time, Osborne didn't even have the chance to lift his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd let out gasps, their faces etched with disbelief and shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> lightning-fast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara had unleashed her chain with such brute force that it was almost beyond comprehension. It had coiled around Osborne before anyone could even process what was going on, each turn tightening like a vice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is bone-chilling!" someone exclaimed in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clara was really holding back! This is her real offensive prowess! Who could react that fast?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne from the Mystic Sirius Sect is trapped! No one has ever managed to break free from Clara's divine artifact chain. He might as well throw in the towel now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"See? I told you Osborne was no match! The only reason he became the champion in the Mystic Sirius Sect is that the sect is just too puny! It's like when the cat's away, the mice will play. But put him up against a real heavy-hitter, and he'll fold like a house of cards!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! And don't forget, he bet ten thousand Sacred Crystals on himself to win. And now, in his very first match of the top sixteen, he's on the verge of defeat. Looks like he's just filling the casino's coffers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's hilarious!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The dark-horse showdown started with a bang but fizzled out just like that! Clara's won this round easily! Osborne's as good as beaten!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd's jeers bore down on the disciples of the Mystic Sirius Sect. Anxiety was written all over their faces as they watched their Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was their champion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he failed here, it would bring them all a mountain of humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Angela felt a twinge of unease in the pit of her stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara's lightning-quick! Osborne was caught off guard. If only he'd been quicker on the draw and shot an arrow, he might've stood a chance! This could turn ugly...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, on the stage, Osborne had never seen Clara's speed coming. By the time he'd wrapped his head around what was going on, Clara's divine artifact&mdash;the chain&mdash;had already wrapped around him like a python.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he felt the iron links tightening, a terrifying force radiated from the chain, draining his strength and pinning him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fought against his restraints, fully aware of the overpowering hold of the quasi-Sacred Artifact chain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he wasn't about to lose his cool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think a quasi-Sacred Artifact can hold me? Fat chance!" Osborne bellowed, channeling the Sacred Power within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deafening surge, a tidal wave of energy burst forth from him, much like a volcano on the verge of eruption, slamming into the binding chains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara sensed the change in power, and her face hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that split-second, Osborne felt Clara unleashing her own Sacred Power. A collision of forces coursed through the quasi-Sacred Artifact chain and into his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? You want a head-on showdown? You </span><span>wanna</span><span> see whose Sacred Power comes out on top? I'm game!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne channeled even more Sacred Power, pushing himself to the brink. This battle would be waged internally, and only he and Clara could feel the raw, searing intensity of their clash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thunder rumbled within Osborne's body as the two Sacred Powers clashed, each vying for supremacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, a smile spread across Osborne's face; his power was stronger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, after fusing with the World Tree fragment, he had gained access to the Chaotic Spiritual Root, which allowed him to replenish his Sacred Power whenever it waned. He had no worries about running out; his strength was boundless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara, though, wasn't as lucky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's dominant Sacred Power started to push back her energy, leaving her face ashen with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How can this be? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>He's just an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King! His Sacred Power shouldn't outmatch mine! And isn't he worried about burning out? Unleashing that much Sacred Power&mdash;it's crazy, even for an Empyrean Sacredness warrior!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara's expression was taut, her teeth clenched as she struggled to keep up with Osborne's power output.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But try as she might, Osborne's Sacred Power raged on uncontrollably, overwhelming hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the pressure broke through!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara coughed up a mouthful of blood, her complexion even paler than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The quasi-Sacred Artifact chain that had coiled around Osborne suddenly went slack, losing its potency and setting him free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I've lost!" Clara gasped, stunned.</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
