  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, feeling the thrill of his newfound abilities, didn't hold back in explaining further to Primordial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The second ability of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity is absolute control!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolute control?" Primordial echoed, intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, fully embodying the form of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity as his roots began to surge energetically, spreading like a web through the void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity have the power of absolute control! If they penetrate someone's body, that person instantly transforms into a Blood Golem. Once turned, they are bound to obey the commands of the Lotus without question, unable to harbor any thoughts of rebellion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Additionally, through these roots, the Lotus can infuse blood energy into the Blood Golem, helping them rapidly elevate their levels&mdash;no bottlenecks allowed! When necessary, the Lotus can even siphon energy back from the Blood Golem."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished explaining, Osborne felt a surge of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that the ability he had to transform members of the Blood Clan was only a fraction of the true power granted to him by the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. Now, fully fused with the Lotus, Osborne understood that the ability he had was just a scaled-down version.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This full ability&mdash;absolute control&mdash;eliminated the need for transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the roots of the Lotus entered someone, they would become a Blood Golem!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Blood Demon Clan were essentially Blood Golems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their true loyalty rested with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity; Osborne had merely been a spokesperson until now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with their essence fully fused, Osborne was the Lotus, and the Lotus was Osborne. Every Blood Golem that stemmed from now on would pledge their loyalty solely to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most exciting part? Osborne could infuse blood energy into the Blood Golems, removing all limitations to their advancement!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking the members of the Blood Demon Clan as an example, in the past, although Osborne could gather blood energy to help them level up, it was contingent upon their innate talent and potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without the requisite talent, no amount of blood energy would break their stagnation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For instance, before reaching the Deity King level, many Blood Demon members found their progress halted at the peak of Deity Overlord due to insufficient potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had to hunt for Miracle Elixirs and Celestial Crystals, only after which they could finally break through to become Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even upon doing so, the Blood Demon members would still face a bottleneck at the Deity King level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Osborne could declare an end to all those limitations!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon members would no longer face such obstacles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as he could supply enough blood energy, he could elevate every single member of the Blood Demon Clan to become Super Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even those with poor talent or those who believed their potential had been exhausted could continue to advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With sufficient blood energy, Osborne could ensure that every single one of them surpassed him in cultivation level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolute control! It doesn't just dominate their will&mdash;it dictates their future!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their levels, their strength..." Osborne murmured, practically vibrating with exhilaration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Primordial was utterly awestruck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial exclaimed, his disbelief palpable, "Absolute defense! Absolute control! This can't be right&mdash;how does this Lotus have such incredible powers? If it came from that Chaotic World, why do I get the feeling the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity is even stronger than the World Tree?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the World Tree is the ultimate sovereign of that Chaotic World! The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity grew under its protection."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne also found it strange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The abilities of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity certainly seemed overwhelmingly powerful, and that was just the tip of the iceberg; there were still three more abilities to uncover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, "What if the reason the World Tree became the ruler of that Chaotic World is simply because it was the first to emerge? If the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity had been born first, maybe the World Tree wouldn't have held the crown!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial fell silent for a moment, letting the idea sink in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he scoffed and said, "You've got to be kidding me! The World Tree is undoubtedly the strongest! That's just a lotus we're talking about. It can't possibly compare!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now tell me, what are the other three abilities of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity? I refuse to believe it can be that powerful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a slight smirk, Osborne replied, "The remaining three abilities are equally formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The third one is absolute guardianship!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial fought the urge to roll his eyes, exasperated. "Absolute guardianship? Come on, give me a break! Is it another defensive ability? How many ways can one thing be afraid of death? There's already an absolute defense, and now there's absolute guardianship?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, "Actually, absolute guardianship isn't solely a defensive ability! Well, not in the traditional sense. What it does is protect our life essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity can replicate the life essence of any being! Once your life essence is documented by the Lotus, even if you die, it can expend energy to bring you back to life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, resurrection? That doesn't sound like anything special. I've told you before, that resurrection has its limits! If you get wiped off the face of existence by something too powerful, no resurrection skill can bring you back," Primordial said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head with a smile. "That's not quite the whole story!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The resurrection capability of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity is far beyond what you imagine! Here's an analogy: it can copy your life essence without impacting you at all. If you were to die, even if a powerful warrior completely obliterated you, as long as your life essence is recorded by the Lotus, it still remains intact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Lotus can then use that essence to recreate you! You know how computers have a copy-paste function? The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity essentially copies your life essence and can 'paste' you somewhere else after your demise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In short, as long as the Lotus has replicated your life essence, it can resurrect you, no matter what kind of entity annihilates you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne finished, and Primordial was left speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a beat, Primordial exclaimed, "That's incredible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what are we waiting for? Get my life essence copied right now! If I can't die, I'll be invincible, hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rolled his eyes at the sudden change in tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Weren't you just complaining about how useless it was before? Now you're desperate? Dream on! I think I won't copy your life essence, and just let you face death instead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial pleaded, "Wait! Don't do that! Come on, Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, please!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, my dear! Copy my life essence! I'm begging you; I'll listen to you from now on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Primordial's dramatic pleas ringing in his ears, Osborne finally relented and activated his powers, replicating Primordial's life essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smile spread across Osborne's face as he said, "From now on, I can finally grant the other members of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings the gift of immortality!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
