  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne revealed his identity, Frederick, Callista, Weston, and the others didn't care much at all, their eyes filled with disdain and mockery.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just like in the previous life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The difference is that in the previous life, they merely looked down on Osborne, but now their eyes are filled with hatred. A murderous intent to eliminate Osborne immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and didn&rsquo;t argue or quarrel with them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He silently took out a bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That is the Apocalypse Bow!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gripping the Apocalypse Bow tightly, Osborne exerted so much force that his veins bulged. He lowered his head, staring at the Apocalypse Bow, his eyes boiling with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Revenge starts now!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne raised his head, his gaze sweeping over Frederick, Callista, Weston, Quinn, Naomi, and the others, choosing his target.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He can only use the Apocalypse Bow once a day!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He needs to choose the first target for revenge!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick is the person Osborne wants to kill the most, but Frederick is wearing Inferior Imperial Artifact Armor and holding an Inferior Imperial Artifact Sword. His strength is also the greatest among them, already infinitely close to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even with the Apocalypse Bow, Osborne has no absolute confidence in seriously injuring or killing Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne gave up on Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Osborne's cultivation level is still only at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection. To be on the safe side, Osborne does not plan to aim today's arrow at Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he looked at Callista.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista is a good target. Although she has also reached Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, her strength is far inferior to Frederick's and even weaker than Weston's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Callista's talent is not top-notch.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she hadn't gained an opportunity in the Skyfall Casket, her cultivation level would only be at Common Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's cultivation level is now at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection. With the Apocalypse Bow in hand, he is over 90% confident he can seriously injure Callista with one arrow, or even kill her outright.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne didn't rush to make a decision.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He then looked at Weston, Quinn, and Naomi respectively.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among the three, Weston's strength is the greatest, even surpassing Callista.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for Quinn and Naomi, they are much weaker. Their cultivation level is currently only at Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness. With the Apocalypse Bow in hand, Osborne is absolutely confident he can kill them with a single arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not even their bodies would remain!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne first ruled out these two because they were not worthy of him using the Apocalypse Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Apocalypse Bow can only shoot one arrow a day!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even without the Apocalypse Bow, Osborne is confident he can handle the two of them. So using the Apocalypse Bow would be a complete waste.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, what Osborne wants is not to kill them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Killing them with one arrow would be the greatest mercy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne ultimately set his sights on Weston's face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The killing intent in his eyes boiled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Weston sneered, "You bastard, why are you looking at me? Do you still want to make a move on me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Weston's face was full of disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His cultivation level is now Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness. Except for Frederick, he fears no one now! If Frederick didn't have the Imperial Artifact, he wouldn't fear him either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He simply didn't believe Osborne would dare to make a move on him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he looked at Osborne arrogantly. "Bastard, you're dead!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne laughed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Will I die? But the only thing I know is that you might be about to die! My revenge starts now. I will slowly torment you, humiliate you, and make you live in fear."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And you are the first!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne raised the Apocalypse Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Apocalypse Bow looked tattered, with no signs of any power fluctuations, so Weston had no sense of danger at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He even burst into laughter. "You bastard, you're crazy! Your cultivation level is at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection. Even if I stand here motionless and let you attack me as you please, can you hurt me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After he finished speaking, the others around also laughed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick, Callista, Quinn, Naomi, and others all looked at Osborne with disdain at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne did not respond.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the Protective Barrier was about to break. He didn't have much time left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he drew the Apocalypse Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Buzz!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, a radiant and crystal-clear Sacred Power Arrow appeared on the Apocalypse Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Solar Sacred Arrow! Heaven Arrow!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's gaze was icy cold. At this moment, he poured all his power into the Apocalypse Bow, even channeling his hatred and killing intent into it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That radiant arrow instantly emitted an incredibly terrifying aura.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Weston, who was locked onto by the Apocalypse Bow, suddenly turned pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Frederick, Callista, and the others also turned pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not good!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get out of the way!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista shouted loudly at Weston, after all, he was her own son.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But unfortunately, it was already too late.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whoosh!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's Sacred Power Arrow had already shot out, firmly locking onto Weston's aura. This was the power of the Apocalypse Bow. Once targeted by the Apocalypse Bow, the enemy could not evade no matter what&mdash;whether using spatial power to dodge or hiding in Dimensional Space, they would be relentlessly pursued until hit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, once this arrow was shot, it would only stop when its power was exhausted or when it hit the enemy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Weston couldn't possibly dodge the arrow's speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, the arrow reached Weston in the blink of an eye. Weston only had time to unleash power to protect himself before being instantly hit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The terrifying explosion instantly engulfed Weston. The immense force swept in all directions, pushing back Callista, Quinn, Naomi, and others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that moment, everyone clearly heard Weston's piercing, agonizing scream.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone's eyes narrowed sharply in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The power of this arrow was simply terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Frederick looked utterly shocked. Fear flashed in his eyes. He even instinctively stepped back quickly, as if wanting to distance himself further from Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How is this possible?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What kind of bow and arrow is this?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick stared at the Apocalypse Bow in Osborne's hand, his eyes filled with fear and greed!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The power of Osborne's arrow was no weaker than his full-strength strike.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick knew this was definitely not a power Osborne could unleash on his own. It was all because of the Apocalypse Bow in Osborne's hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone attacking outside the Protective Barrier showed terrified expressions. They no longer dared to attack the Protective Barrier and quickly fled to the distance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When the terrifying aftermath of the power dissipated, everyone was shocked to find Weston lying in the void. The Supreme Sacred Artifact Armor around him was completely destroyed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Weston had also fallen into a coma!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's arrow had severely injured Weston, who was already a Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, it was incredibly quiet all around.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only Callista, seeing her most outstanding son Weston severely injured, looked utterly grief-stricken. She immediately rushed forward, wanting to check on Weston&rsquo;s condition.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne let out a cold snort at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He raised the Apocalypse Bow again, aimed at Callista, and sneered, "Callista, if you dare move, you'll end up just like him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Callista's body froze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at the Apocalypse Bow in Osborne's hand, her eyes filled with fear and dread.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Weston's strength is greater than hers!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Weston was severely injured and knocked out by one arrow from Osborne; how could she possibly withstand an arrow from him?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Callista didn&rsquo;t dare to move at all and could only glare angrily at Osborne.</span></p><div class="pagination">
