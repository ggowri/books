  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Quasi-Divine Rankings!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Godson Rankings!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Diviner League issued both rankings, and Osborne had only heard of them. This time, he finally got to see the full list.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Quasi-Divine Rankings&nbsp;only had 100 individuals on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To be ranked, one had to be an&nbsp;S-class Supreme Overlord, and among the best of them. For instance,&nbsp;Wesson Augustine, the Godfather's butler, though an&nbsp;S-class Supreme Overlord, was not on the list.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne&nbsp;quickly scanned the Quasi-Divine Rankings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As expected, the number one spot was held by&nbsp;Helios Thornberry, named after the Sun God. More than 200 years ago, he was the first to host the&nbsp;Honor Quest Ceremony, defeating all challengers until none dared to face him. He cleared the ceremony without opposition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His name was highlighted in bold gold letters by the&nbsp;Diviner League.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was incredibly dazzling!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For some reason, seeing that shining golden name stirred something strange inside&nbsp;Osborne, a sudden impulse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If my name appears here one day, glowing in gold like this...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That would be quite something!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that thought,&nbsp;Osborne&nbsp;quickly shook his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was the number one spot on the Quasi-Divine Rankings. It was practically the strongest person on Earth, the one closest to being a god, unmatched by anyone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for him, he had only just entered the Godson Rankings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was far, far away from this level.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not to mention him. Even the legendary powerhouse from&nbsp;Rosmandi, the&nbsp;Godfather, was far from reaching this rank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The&nbsp;Godfather&nbsp;was only ranked 75th on the Quasi-Divine Rankings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Additionally, the&nbsp;King of the Aberrants&nbsp;held the 60th spot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne&nbsp;continued to skim through the list and soon came across a familiar name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Reginald Hastings!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Deputy Leader of the&nbsp;League of Divine Descent&nbsp;and patriarch of the&nbsp;Hastings Family&nbsp;from&nbsp;Marcelin. He was also one of the suspects who might have kidnapped&nbsp;Osborne's&nbsp;parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His ranking on the&nbsp;Global Quasi-Divine Rankings&nbsp;was much higher than the&nbsp;King of the Aberrants.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had made it into the top 50.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ranked 46th!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne&nbsp;couldn't help but take a deep breath, his face turning grim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because, at his peak, the&nbsp;Godfather&nbsp;had only been ranked 51st!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That meant&nbsp;Reginald&nbsp;was even stronger than the&nbsp;Godfather&nbsp;at his best!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne&nbsp;clenched his fists.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If he really is the one who took my parents, then to take revenge and rescue my mother, I'll need to surpass the&nbsp;Godfather&nbsp;at his peak!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne&nbsp;bit his lip, feeling the immense pressure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, that pressure became even greater.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because he spotted yet another familiar name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emperor Dare!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was the top assassin of the&nbsp;Eityreia Organization, who was also a potential suspect in his parents' abduction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emperor Dare's&nbsp;ranking on the&nbsp;Global Quasi-Divine Rankings&nbsp;was so high that it made&nbsp;Osborne&nbsp;feel uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ranked 11th!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was just shy of breaking into the top 10.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In other words, if&nbsp;Emperor Dare&nbsp;was the one who kidnapped&nbsp;Osborne's&nbsp;parents. To exact revenge,&nbsp;Osborne&nbsp;would have to become one of the top 10 strongest people in the world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne&nbsp;took a deep breath, trying to calm himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't care how high your ranking is or how strong you are! If you really took my parents, I will find you, and you will pay for it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Muttering to himself,&nbsp;Osborne&nbsp;shifted his gaze to the second list.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Godson Rankings!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For&nbsp;Osborne, the Quasi-Divine Rankings&nbsp;were far out of reach. Even the person ranked at the bottom could easily kill him a hundred times over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was the Godson Rankings&nbsp;that he needed to focus on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone on the&nbsp;Godson Rankings&nbsp;was a top&nbsp;AAA-class. The top 10 were even said to be able to fight against&nbsp;S-class Supreme Overlords, earning the title of&nbsp;Quasi-Overlord.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he scanned the list,&nbsp;Osborne&nbsp;quickly found a familiar name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bryce Clarkson!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kendran's&nbsp;brother, and Bryce Clarkson, the leader of the pirates at&nbsp;Likreia Mountain!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bryce&nbsp;ranked 6th on the&nbsp;Global Quasi-Divine Rankings!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Bryce&nbsp;is ranked 6th on the&nbsp;Quasi-Divine Rankings? With the power of the&nbsp;Trident of Poseidon&nbsp;at sea, no wonder he doesn't even fear the&nbsp;King of the Aberrants."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne&nbsp;took a deep breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I wonder if&nbsp;Isa's&nbsp;name is on here, too. She's&nbsp;AAA-class, and even&nbsp;Bryce&nbsp;admires her. She should be ranked on the Rankings&nbsp;as well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne&nbsp;searched for&nbsp;Isa's&nbsp;name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne&nbsp;even thought that with her strength,&nbsp;Isa&nbsp;deserved to be ranked first on the Godson Rankings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, the first name on the Godson Rankings&nbsp;wasn't&nbsp;Isa, but someone with the codename Lord.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Lord?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne&nbsp;muttered, "That's definitely not&nbsp;Isa. Her codename is&nbsp;Night Witch, but it's strange... why isn't she in the top 10?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne&nbsp;quickly scanned through the Godson Rankings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Out of the 500 names,&nbsp;Osborne&nbsp;searched three times but couldn't find&nbsp;Isa&nbsp;listed anywhere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even&nbsp;Axell was now ranked 465th, but&nbsp;Isa was nowhere to be found.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Weird!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne&nbsp;frowned deeply. It didn't make sense. How could someone with&nbsp;Isa's&nbsp;strength not be ranked?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Could it be... has&nbsp;Isa&nbsp;already broken through to&nbsp;S-class Supreme Overlord?"</p><div class="pagination">
