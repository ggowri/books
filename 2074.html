  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all your fault for being so weak! Once we reach Umbra Earth, I might not even be able to protect you on my own! That is why I must recruit several geniuses from the World of Racial Convergence to guard you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I do it all for you, you know!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, with my strength alone, I could tear through Umbra Earth and snatch every treasure it holds!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Alfreda finished speaking, her face shone with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but laugh, "I think you're just scared, aren't you? You probably want to recruit more World of Racial Convergence warriors because you believe safety comes with numbers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's eyes flashed with anger and embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't talk nonsense! I do this all to protect you. Your level is just too low!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough chatter. I will form the most powerful exploration team there is! Once we set out, we will leave all the other princes and princesses in the dust!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tomorrow, come see me and we'll head to the Combat Arena to recruit!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda glared fiercely at Osborne, yet he only found her endearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smiling, he nodded. "Alright, I'll be there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At last, Osborne had officially joined Alfreda's exploration team. With this proper affiliation, he could now enter Umbra Earth without worry. Osborne was thrilled. He no longer had to puzzle over how to sneak into Umbra Earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also believed they should recruit other geniuses from the World of Racial Convergence to boost the team's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, neither he nor Alfreda fully knew what dangers Umbra Earth might hold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stronger the team, the safer they would be, and the greater their rewards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope everything goes smoothly from here on out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After bidding farewell to Alfreda, Osborne returned to his wooden cabin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night passed in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Osborne arrived at Alfreda's treehouse and knocked on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Coming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda was already prepared. "Let's go! We head to the Combat Arena. With my strength and reputation, countless geniuses from the World of Racial Convergence will be clamoring to join my exploration team!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda exuded confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Osborne was not as optimistic. After all, Alfreda was a Nature Elf, and the Nature Elves were rather weak at the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, everyone in Elf City knew about this matter!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Alfreda was an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King, it did not guarantee that many genuine warriors from the World of Racial Convergence would join her team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Osborne and Alfreda reached the Combat Arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, none of the other princes and princesses of the Elf Royal Family had arrived&mdash;they were the first ones there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go over there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda pointed in a direction. "That must be the recruitment spot for warriors! They actually set us up in such a remote place? Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grumbled a little but obediently walked over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, the Combat Arena was already filled with many warriors from the World of Racial Convergence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they saw Alfreda, their expressions changed instantly, and they began whispering to each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that Princess Alfreda of the Nature Elf Royal Family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard that Princess Alfreda offended the Fire Elf Royal Family and was forced to form an exploration team to scour Umbra Earth. This time she must find ten Flame Gold Crystals to compensate the Fire Elf Royal Family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nature Elves are so weak now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Joining Princess Alfreda's exploration team might provoke the ire of the Fire Elf Royal Family. They might even target her..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly. If possible, one should never join Princess Alfreda's team! I've heard that the Nature Elf Royal Family can no longer provide her with proper guards on Umbra Earth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Princess Alfreda's team is doomed to be the weakest of them all! They might not even be able to protect themselves in Umbra Earth, let alone discover or snatch treasures!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm never considering joining Princess Alfreda's team!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want to make enemies of the Fire Elf Royal Family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I definitely don't want to die on Umbra Earth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The murmurs of the crowd were low, yet Alfreda, as an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King, heard every word clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her delicate face flushed red with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Who said that my exploration team would be the weakest? They even claim we lack the ability to protect ourselves in Umbra Earth?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They are all talking nonsense!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if my father did not provide me with warrior guards, my team is still the strongest!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't want to join, then I have no </span><span>place</span><span> for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda shouted in indignation. The nearby warriors from the World of Racial Convergence, sensing her fury, quickly scattered away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In any case, Alfreda was a princess of the Nature Elf Royal Family, and none dared offend her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, no one remained around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that no one had come forward to register for the selection test, Alfreda grew even more upset.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These people have no taste at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, don't you agree?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled lightly, "Exactly! They have no sense. If they don't join your exploration team, they will regret it later!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing his words, Alfreda laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You always know what to say!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alfreda settled down, patiently waiting. She was convinced that sooner or later someone would come forward, eager to join her exploration team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She believed that there would be people who truly appreciated her team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda remained as confident as ever!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sat beside her and stared at an Astral Testing Arch not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to contain his curiosity, he asked, "Alfreda, what is this Astral Testing Arch? It seems that every prince and princess uses it to assess the geniuses from the World of Racial Convergence. Do they decide recruitment based on the overall score given by the Arch?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is called the Astral Testing Arch! It can quickly and roughly assess a being's age, level, Divine Body, power attributes, energy intensity, and even soul power, among other things. These factors are then combined into an overall score.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A higher score means a person of that level is stronger and has greater potential for future achievements...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The scoring classes are divided into Class F, Class E, Class D, Class C, Class B, Class A, Class S, and Class SS!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Generally, reaching a Class C score means the person is a super genius, able to defeat more than ninety percent of warriors at the same level. Achieving a Class B score is truly remarkable! On a planet with over a trillion beings, there are fewer than ten individuals who can reach a Class B score!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for Class A, that represents an extraordinarily gifted genius!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Class S is reserved for those who rank among the top super-geniuses in the entire cosmos. Every faction would vie for someone like that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And Class SS..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Alfreda hesitated for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, she leaned in and whispered to Osborne, "I'll tell you a secret, but you must never tell anyone else!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Actually, my overall score is Class SS!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I do not die, I can easily ascend to Empyrean Sacredness. And Empyrean Sacredness is only the beginning for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alfreda looked at Osborne proudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now you see just how powerful I am, don't you?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
