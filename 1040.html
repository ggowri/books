  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the human slave culture tank I've prepared for you!" Gerardo sneered at Osborne. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should feel honored to be in it! There will never be another like this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Every single substance inside is incredibly precious! There are over three hundred kinds of millennium-old medicines! And rare minerals! I've exhausted nearly all my resources just to acquire them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, the most valuable component is the blood of gods! It's not any blood but the 'heart blood' of gods!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The heart blood of the Goddess Medusa, the Wolf God, the Titan God, the Vampire God, and the Minotaur is all in here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Goddess Medusa's heart blood will enhance your vision. Wolf God's will fortify your internal organs. The Titan God's heart blood will increase your muscle strength. The Vampire God's will strengthen your blood vessels and meridians. And the Minotaur's will elevate your skin and flesh defense to an extraordinary level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This wealth of the five major gods' blood, combined with various ancient medicines and rare minerals, has created this vast amount of culture fluid! Even I can't make another one!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only the most powerful and talented individuals are worthy of entering this elite human slave culture tank and utilizing this culture fluid! Even the Lord is not qualified!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you are already qualified to use it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You may only be Class AAA, but you've killed Class S warriors so easily! You can even stand toe-to-toe with the top-tier Class S! Moreover, you are the only one in the past hundred years to have cleared the Honor Quest Ceremony! You truly are the greatest genius in this world!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That&rsquo;s why I'm rewarding this to you. Once your body absorb it, it will become even stronger, achieving an unprecedented level of power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But remember, you'll also become enslaved! From that moment on, you will be my human slave, bound to obey every command of mine! Even if I order you to die, you'll follow it without hesitation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Gerardo finished speaking, he turned to Osborne, a sneer on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned grave, and a chill crept up his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo had shared too much today&mdash;secrets that must never see the light of day. It was clear that Gerardo was confident Osborne couldn&rsquo;t expose these.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because he was sure he could turn Osborne into his Human Slave!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne resisted, but his body was unable to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze was fixated on the large dish filled with the ominous red culture fluid. Unease settled deep within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't think I'm worthy of such a precious culture medium! There are undoubtedly individuals far more powerful than I am. You should reserve it for someone else," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you afraid? I doubt there is anyone stronger than you in this world&mdash;at least, I didn&rsquo;t meet one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile. "That's because you've seen too few. I know someone&mdash;she's far more powerful than I could ever be! A hundred times stronger, in fact! She's more worthy of this culture medium than I am!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprised, Gerardo raised an eyebrow. "Oh? Really? Who is she?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Her name is... Isa Bowin! Isa Bowin! Isa Bowin!" Osborne declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo was momentarily stunned, clearly unfamiliar with the name. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned. "Why repeat her name three times?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled again, "Important things deserve repetition! And so do important people. Isa is incredibly powerful, and I couldn't help but call her name repeatedly to show my respect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Osborne was calling for Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The threat of Gerardo's culture medium filled him with dread. He had a sinking feeling, and he finally decided to reach out to Isa for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dignity was trivial in comparison to survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Isa was his woman; sacrificing a bit of dignity was a small price to pay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, he called out for Isa, hoping she would come to his rescue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo chuckled and mocked, "Isa Bowin, you say? I'll look into it. If she truly is that powerful, I'll capture her and add her to my Human Slave culture tank!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But right now," he continued, "I think you're just buying yourself time! I refuse to believe there's anyone ten or a hundred times more powerful than you! Stop resisting and come into it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne's body was thrown in the culture tank as the lid of opened wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Isa had not yet arrived to save him!</span></p><div class="pagination">
