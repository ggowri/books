  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's patience had worn thin. With a cold snort, he launched himself into action, his fellow Superior Deities flanking him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The combined might of five Superior Deities was an unstoppable force, especially against mere Junior Deities. Even if those Junior Deities boasted Level Three Divine Bodies, they stood no chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, even fifty Intermediate Deities would struggle against five Superior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, when Joseph and his companions made their move, Bryce, Anastasia, and the others monitoring the situation from within the Augustine Bastion knew they had to act fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They rushed out, joining the fray just as Joseph and his team engaged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In total, there were over seventy of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alongside Sebastian and his fifty fighters, the Augustine family had amassed a formidable force of one hundred and twenty Junior Deities. This was nearly all of the Augustine family's deified members, aside from Osborne and the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One hundred and twenty Junior Deities was no small army. Just over two weeks prior, the Deschanel Clan had launched an attack against the Pantheon League, which had only fielded a little over a hundred Junior Deities in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The difference? The Augustine family's Junior Deities all possessed at least Level Three Divine Bodies, vastly outclassing the majority of the Pantheon League's fighters, who were mostly at Level One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, the Augustine family lacked Intermediate Deities and, more critically, any Superior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without that high-tier combat power, their one hundred and twenty Junior Deities found themselves at a severe disadvantage against the five Superior Deities of the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Joseph unleashed a barrage of attacks, the Augustine family fighters were pushed back. He took a moment to assess the new arrivals, his eyes widening in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph exclaimed, a mixture of excitement and greed flashing across his face, "Wow, you've got even more Junior Deities hidden away? The Augustine family has one hundred and twenty divine members? And they're all at least Level Three?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impressive, impressive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But once I take you all down, that secret will belong to the Deschanel Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze swept over the crowd, and when it landed on Bryce, his shock deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Another Level Five Divine Body?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jealousy flickered in Joseph's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having a Level Five Divine Body as a Junior Deity was a rarity, something that hadn't appeared in ages during the Age of Gods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here were two of them, right in the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he not feel envious?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then Joseph spotted something even more astonishing. His gaze locked onto Anastasia, and his jaw dropped in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's voice cracked, his composure slipping as he stared at Anastasia, utterly dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Level Six Divine Body? How is that even possible?! A Level Six Divine Body? This has to be a joke!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could anyone possess such power as a Junior Deity? Even the mighty Deity Kings usually peak at Level Four or Five when they're Junior Deities!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's only one person ever rumored to have a Level Six Divine Body at that stage&mdash; the most powerful among the Deity Kings, the God of Night!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can you possibly have a Level Six Divine Body?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His incredulous shout echoed through the chaos, drawing the attention of the other four Superior Deities beside him, who were equally stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They gawked at Anastasia, their expressions a mix of awe and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia frowned slightly, choosing to ignore their astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph took a deep breath, forcing himself to calm down, and whispered, "Everyone, give it your all! You've seen it&mdash;the Augustine family is hiding something huge! If we can bring this secret back, we'll all be rewarded handsomely!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These ants of the Augustine family, with just a bunch of Junior Deities, all possess Divine Bodies at Level Three or above, even Level Five and Six! If I'm right, there must be some kind of treasure that enhances Divine Bodies during ascension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we can get our hands on it and present it to the clan, the patriarch will certainly reward us richly! Our Deschanel Clan will produce countless prodigies and super prodigies, and even our descendants might ascend with Level Four, Five, or Six Divine Bodies!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Soon, our clan might even produce a Deity King warrior!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words ignited a frenzy of excitement among the four, their eyes blazing with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No more talking! Crush them and seize the Augustine family's secrets! Bring it all back to the clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph and his four companions were now fully unleashed, their powers surging without restraint. Sebastian, Anastasia, and the hundred-twenty-plus Junior Deities of the Augustine family were utterly overwhelmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood spurted from mouths, faces paled, and Divine Bodies shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disparity in strength was too vast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, with the strongest Divine Body, stood at the forefront, but even she couldn't hold the line. She summoned a terrifying sea of thunder, attempting to counterattack, only to be obliterated by Joseph and his allies' overwhelming divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia spat out blood, her eyes filled with shock and despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't hold out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their current strength, they couldn't withstand the onslaught of five Superior Deities. If this continued, many would perish here, and the rest would be captured by the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do we do?" Anastasia's voice trembled with desperation.</span></p><div class="pagination">
