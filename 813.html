  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's body slammed into the mountainside with a thunderous impact, creating a massive crater.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert stood still with a cold smile on his face.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that all you've got, Osborne? Facing me at full strength, you look pathetic. You can't even block a single blow from me. Do you really think you're worthy of being my opponent?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne, coughing up blood, staggered to his feet.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His gaze locked onto the massive staff in Cuthbert's hands. Cuthbert was a formidable force, ranked thirty-sixth in the Godson Rankings&mdash;one of the highest among the younger generation.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At Cuthbert's peak, with the divine artifact in hand, Osborne knew he was far from a match for Cuthbert.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had to admit he wasn't ready to take on Cuthbert just yet.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert's face gleamed with triumph. "What's the matter? Giving up already?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Realizing how powerful I am now, aren't you? You were so lucky to beat me in the Honor Quest Ceremony. Outside that arena, killing you is a piece of cake!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wasn't rushing to attack.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instead, Cuthbert relished taunting Osborne, as if to prove that his loss at the Honor Quest Ceremony was nothing but a fluke.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne couldn't help but smirk and retort, "So what? True, I'm not your equal right now.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I did beat you in the Honor Quest Ceremony!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You were my defeated foe!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I humiliated you in front of the world's top young warriors. I had my foot on your neck, and there was nothing you could do about it."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert's face contorted with rage, his cheeks quivering.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes blazed crimson as Osborne's words sliced into his pride like a knife.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm going to kill you!" Cuthbert roared, his anger boiling over.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He tightened his grip on the divine artifact staff and swung it mercilessly at Osborne's head.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The staff whistled through the air.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's face tightened with concern as he felt the terrifying force behind the swing. He didn't try to stand his ground.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instead, a sleek energy pistol appeared in his hand.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Super energy pistol! Looks like you're my only hope!" Osborne thought, gritting his teeth.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He activated the pistol with fierce determination, channeling power into it and activating the Divine Bone Crystal.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A humming sound filled the air as the Divine Bone Crystal shot out a concentrated burst of energy, compressing it into a divine power bullet.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without hesitation, Osborne pulled the trigger.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The divine power bullet streaked out with lightning speed, hitting Cuthbert's staff with explosive force. It shattered the staff's power as if it were a comet smashing into a planet.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The bullet continued its path with devastating force, battering Cuthbert's divine artifact and hurtling toward him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert's expression hardened.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Strength Realm!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He activated his Strength Realm immediately, a powerful aura enveloping him. Cuthbert swung his staff again, finally shattering the divine power bullet.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the shockwave from the impact still forced him back, his hands numbing from the force.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stared at Osborne in disbelief.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Osborne aimed again and fired.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The fearsome divine power bullet pierced through Cuthbert's defenses, striking him directly and causing a tremendous explosion that nearly tore him apart.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But just as the bullet was about to cause fatal damage, a brilliant Powerstone materialized in Cuthbert's chest, blocking the divine power bullet and deflecting its explosive force.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's face was pale, his exhaustion evident.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The continuous use of the Super Energy Pistol had drained him significantly. To inflict damage on Cuthbert, he had to channel as much power as possible into the weapon to activate the Divine Bone Crystal.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After just two shots, over half of Osborne's energy was spent, leaving him feeling weak and drained.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he saw the Powerstone within Cuthbert's body blocking the divine power bullet, his brow furrowed with frustration.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's see who will give in first. Your defenses or my dwindling strength!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne gritted his teeth, pouring the last of his power into the super energy pistol.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The immense energy surged through, completely activating the Divine Bone Crystal. A formidable burst of divine power surged forth, compressed into an incredibly powerful bullet.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne took aim at Cuthbert and pulled the trigger once more.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This divine power bullet was far stronger than the previous two.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No!" Cuthbert roared, finally sensing the imminent threat.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He unleashed every ounce of his strength, desperately trying to fend off the incoming bullet.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a deafening roar, the divine power bullet smashed through Cuthbert's defenses and struck him directly. Even his Powerstone couldn't hold up against it.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert's body erupted violently, tearing apart in a massive explosion.</p><div class="pagination">
