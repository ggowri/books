  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne took the emblem, looking helpless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Caleb mentioned the special rule, he vaguely felt that he would be the one who would get the emblem first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sure enough, Caleb gave him the other emblem.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne didn't know whether Caleb was deliberately targeting him or whether Godfather intended to make the test of more difficult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What he knew was that he was in trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Originally, he wanted to keep a low profile and let others fight for the emblem and consume their strength. He would take action at the end to snatch it and become the future heir with the least effort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now his thoughts were shattered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he got this emblem, he would become the enemy of everyone, and they would all chase him and try their best to snatch his emblem.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was impossible for him to keep a low profile or watch others fight for it first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Besides, he couldn't lose the emblem.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once he lost the emblem, he would be eliminated. In other words, he had to keep the emblem for six hours while being chased by more than a hundred people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was this possible?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne didn't know. He only knew that the next battle would be a difficult one. If he wanted to stand out, he would have to use all his strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Godfather taught me to never let my enemies know all my cards. But now, he is forcing me to show them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne felt helpless, but his face showed no expression. He just casually hung the emblem on his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other people breathed a sigh of relief when they saw Caleb give the emblem to Osborne. Then they looked at Osborne jokingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's destined to be ninth anyway. It's just the difference between being eliminated earlier or later." John said in a low voice with disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne ignored him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam grinned and said, "Osborne, if you hand over the emblem to me later, I will give you whatever you want."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne also ignored him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam's face turned dark and said coldly, "Hey, I'm talking to you. Didn't you hear me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled. "Your words make me feel ridiculous. I just don't want to answer you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What did you say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam's expression was cold. "Say it again. Do you believe that I will break all of your legs and crush all the bones in your body?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne said calmly, "I don't believe it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam wanted to hit Osborne, but suddenly, a terrible force pressed on him, making him unable to move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was Caleb.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He said calmly, "The Branch Bloodline Competition has not officially started yet. You can't take action now. Anyone who starts a fight will be disqualified immediately."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam could only nod.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he still threatened Osborne in a low voice, "Osborne, you'd better run faster. If I catch you, I will break your limbs and crush your bones."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's face turned cold. "Really? I'm looking forward to meeting you and seeing how miserable you look after your limbs are broken."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just wait and see."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam's face was full of ferocity, and he stared at Osborne like a wild beast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne ignored him and looked at Caleb.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Elder Caleb, I have a few more questions about the rules."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb smiled. "Tell me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne said, "The emblem will send a signal and be located by everyone. I want to know the accuracy of the positioning."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The accuracy is not very high, only three hundred yards in radius."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's eyes lit up. Three hundred yards in radius was large in the jungle, and there was room for him to maneuver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He continued to ask, "Is it possible that the signal it sends can be blocked?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Theoretically it's impossible, but someone might have special methods to block the signal. If the signal disappears for an hour, the owner will be considered to have lost the emblem and will be eliminated directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So don't try to hide your emblem and win the competition by hiding."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne frowned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if there was a way to block the signal, it only could be blocked for an hour. Otherwise, he would be eliminated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He asked the last question, which was also the most crucial one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He pointed at Lance and asked, "Can the person who has an emblem attack the owner of another emblem to get both emblems?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb smiled and shook his head. "No!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"One person can only have one emblem."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing Caleb's words, Osborne smiled and nodded, feeling relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, it's about time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The competition is held within the Lostridge Mountains. No one can leave here before the competition is over, or they will be eliminated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As for the specific rules, I will send them to you later. You can study them on your own."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb looked at Osborne and Lance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You two get the emblems first, and you can leave the helicopter now. The others will leave in ten minutes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone became excited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Almost everyone was staring at Osborne with a playful look as if they were staring at their prey.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Lance also got the emblem, he was ignored by other people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne took a deep breath and nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The helicopter door was open, and strong winds rushed in. Osborne turned his head and glanced at everyone, saying calmly, "I'll be waiting for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying that, he jumped out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Branch Bloodline Competition had officially begun.</p><div class="pagination">
