  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro, Zachary, and the others couldn't help but furrow their brows at the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, how long are you planning to be gone this time?" Jethro asked, his voice low and serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hudson family assumed that Osborne intended to leave for quite a while. After all, he had mentioned that by the time he returned, he would be ready to take on Trevor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Trevor was no ordinary foe&mdash;he was a Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Osborne currently at mid-level Deity King, they believed only a Supernal Deity King could stand against another of his kind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, they figured Osborne must be planning to break through to Supernal Deity King before returning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How long would that take?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They felt the urge to persuade him to stay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after a moment of contemplation, Osborne spoke up, "If everything goes smoothly, I'll be back in two to three months. If things drag on, it might take about a year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Worst-case scenario, I won't be gone more than two years!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His goal this time was ambitious, he intended to scour the forty-two divine peaks scattered across Celestara and gather all the Miracle Elixirs surrounding them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These peaks were divided into four zones&mdash;East, West, South, and North&mdash;each housing ten peaks, with two in the Central Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to Osborne's spatial power and Satan's Eye, collecting from a single divine peak wouldn't take long. If all went well, he figured he could spend about two days per peak, factoring in travel time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, realistically, he could return in three months, give or take.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, he knew that unexpected events would likely occur along the way, pushing the timeline further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Osborne was confident that within one to two years, he could gather everything he needed and return to the Hudson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words left everyone momentarily speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two to three months if you're lucky? A year or two at the most? That doesn't sound too long..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the gods of Celestara, time wasn't a pressing concern. With their long lives, a year or two could pass in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the fact that Osborne believed he could reach a level capable of challenging Trevor in such a short span?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was hard to swallow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skepticism hung in the air as they exchanged glances, each of them wondering if Osborne was merely trying to boost their spirits with bravado.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But was it really wise to set such an unattainable goal? Trevor was a Supernal Deity King, while Osborne was still just a mid-level Deity King. In their eyes, even reaching the peak of Deity King in one or two years would be an extraordinary feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To take on Trevor, Osborne would need to ascend to Supernal Deity King status, and that was a whole different ball game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had no doubt about Osborne's talent. They all knew that with his potential, he had over a ninety percent chance of becoming a Supernal Deity King someday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that was a long way off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leap from peak Deity King to Supernal Deity King was notoriously difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Take the Hudson family, for instance. They had over a thousand peak Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every one of Osborne's uncles and aunts had reached that level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, among them, there was only one Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was Jethro himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did those thousand peak Deity Kings not aspire to become Supernal Deity Kings? Of course, they did! They dreamed of it, but the harsh reality was that breaking through was incredibly tough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless individuals had tried, but a staggering ninety-nine percent had ultimately failed, spending their lives trapped at the peak of Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, they couldn't bring themselves to believe that Osborne could make that leap in such a short time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It simply wasn't feasible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they kept their thoughts to themselves, not wanting to dampen Osborne's spirits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro said, his tone softening, "Well, since you've made up your mind, I won't try to change it. The world out there is vast, and it's good to get out and see it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just remember to stay safe while you're out there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come here; let me bind your energy signature with the Binding Twin Pearl. If you find yourself in danger, this pearl will alert me! And if you channel some divine power into it, I'll be able to sense it and rush to your side."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Jethro produced a black-and-white pearl&mdash;the Binding Twin Pearl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Osborne didn't hesitate. He knew that if he refused, Jethro and Zachary would never feel at ease about his departure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the pearl split into two, embedding itself in both Jethro and Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of sensing the connection, Osborne asked curiously, "Grandpa, now that we're bound by the Binding Twin Pearl, if you're in danger, will I be able to sense it? Can I also teleport to you to help?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro paused, a surprised look crossing his face before he chuckled. "What's this? You think you can come to my rescue? Silly boy, I'm an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King, soon to be Ascension Three! If I'm facing danger that I can't handle, teleporting over would just put you in harm's way. I can't let that happen!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
