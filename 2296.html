  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Frost Peak City, the entire expanse of the sky was commandeered by gigantic projected screens, broadcasting the state duel live. All it took was a casual glance upwards, and one could immerse themselves in the action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The screens were teeming with figures braving perilous terrains in a frenzied quest for something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Folks from every nook and cranny of Zephyr State were transfixed by these images, practically with their noses glued to the screens, desperately scouring for a glimpse of their own sect's disciples.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the onlookers were Danilo and Angela, the Peak Lord of the Mystic Sirius Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela pointed out, squinting at the screen. "Look, Bethan and Jamar have camped out at the third layer. Given their skills, they'd be hard-pressed to make it through the fourth layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm. If they went charging in there recklessly, they'd probably get kicked out of the competition. Searching for tokens on the third layer? That's a smart play."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danilo gave a thoughtful nod. "Let's face it, with their current strength, they're not going to snag a high-ranking spot in the state duel. Accepting invitations to join other teams? That's a savvy way to rake in some Sacred Crystals. And just being in the duel is a golden opportunity for them to grow and learn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela let out a long, weary sigh, a tinge of resignation lacing her voice. "The Mystic Sirius Sect? We're just a drop in the bucket in Zephyr State. We're hardly even noticeable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think about it. In all the previous state duels, the best our disciples have ever managed is to fall short of making the top hundred. There were a couple of times they helped others land in the top twenty, but who even remembers that? It's like a drop in the ocean of this competition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, I'm really hoping Osborne can throw us a curveball and pull something off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danilo shot her a look, his face etched with mild shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a skeptical grunt and shook his head. "You're dreaming if you think Osborne can score a decent result. That's asking for the moon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This year's state duel is like a shark tank. The competition is stiffer than ever; it's as if all the top-notch talent decided to show up at once. These super prodigies have popped out of thin air, blowing everyone's minds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson, for instance. They've somehow managed to blend three powers at the Supernal Deity King Level. In any other state duel, any one of them would have walked away with the trophy, no questions asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even in the zone duel, with a bit of good fortune, they'd all be shoo-ins for the top ten and make it to the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel. But now, they're going to be going at each other like dogs fighting over a bone just to stay in the game. If they really catch a bad break, some of them might not even make it out of the state duel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've heard the same story from other states. There's been a sudden influx of these insanely talented folks, even scarier than the ones here in Zephyr State. In a normal </span><span>year, they'd be guaranteed state </span><span>duel</span><span> champions. Now, they're scrapping for whatever they can get."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danilo paused for a moment, shaking his head once again. "Osborne's got skills, no doubt about it. But in this cut-throat environment, getting a top spot in the state duel? That's about as likely as pigs flying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, it's a tough nut to crack," Angela agreed, the glimmer of hope in her eyes fading a smidge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that she doubted Osborne; rather, she was being realistic about the stiff competition he faced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logic told her not to set her sights too high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes, the heart has its own reasons, and emotions could overrule cold, hard logic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela's eyes lit up again, and her voice regained its firmness. "But just think about the Mystic Sirius Sect's tournament and the Tempest Fortress City's city duel. No one gave Osborne a snowball's chance in hell of winning. Everyone said he didn't stand a ghost of a chance! Yet, time and time again, he managed to turn the tables, taking down stronger opponents and walking away with the prize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, maybe we should keep a tiny sliver of hope alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danilo stared at her in disbelief, then let out a wry chuckle and shook his head. "Nah, I still </span><span>ain't</span><span> buying it! With Osborne's current power, he might last a little while on the fifth layer, but there's no way he can stick around there for the long haul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that's the case, it's </span><span>gonna</span><span> be next to impossible for him to rack up enough tokens and points. And let's not forget, he doesn't have a kick-ass team to back him up. He'll be left in the dust by the top hundred in the first stage of the state duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And once that gap starts to widen, trying to catch up in the second stage is like chasing rainbows. It's a total pipe dream!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he talked, Danilo motioned towards the score rankings floating above them. "Take a gander at this. Horace, Broderick, and Benson have already muscled their way into the sixth layer and snagged some emblems. Horace is sitting pretty with a cool 200 thousand points! Broderick and Benson aren't far behind, each with 100 thousand. And players with strong teams, like Conrad, have already sailed past the </span><span>50 thousand-point</span><span> mark...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne going up against them? It's a lost cause, plain and simple."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Danilo's face went slack, and a look of sheer disbelief washed over him as he gawked at the projection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the big deal?" Angela asked, all confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She followed Danilo's line of sight up to the screens, and in no time, her face mirrored his shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on a second... Where is Osborne?! Wasn't Osborne on camera just now? I'm pretty sure he was going into the fifth layer along with the others. How the hell did he just disappear into thin air?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danilo took a deep breath, and his voice suddenly turned serious as a heart attack. "I just saw Osborne go... into the sixth layer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela let out a gasp, completely floored. "What?! Osborne went to the sixth layer? What in the world is he thinking? With his strength, there's no way he can make it there. He'll be a goner in minutes, shredded by those storms!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He couldn't possibly find a token up there in such a short time. </span><span>So</span><span> what's he doing running up there?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is crazy! So damn reckless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela sounded a real mix of worried sick and ticked off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The sixth layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm is way too extreme to keep tabs on properly. The winds are blowing like a son of a gun up there all the time. Any camera equipment we set up gets trashed quicker than you can say 'Jack Robinson'. We've got no clue what's going down up there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Worry etched across Angela's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The projections could only display the first five layers of the Arctic Maw Chasm. Osborne had slipped into the sixth layer and simply dropped off the screens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For all they knew, he could be lying cold and dead up there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danilo frowned and said, "He's out of his mind! I'll bet he got his hackles up seeing Horace, Broderick, and Benson each score 100 thousand points and decided to go for the big bucks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's too hot-headed, that's his problem. He..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danilo suddenly stopped short. His eyes went as wide as saucers as he gawked at the projections. Danilo looked totally </span><span>gobsmacked</span><span> and even rubbed his eyes, thinking he must be seeing things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a ripple of gasps spread through Frost Peak City like wildfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look! The leaderboard's changing again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the heck is Osborne? He just shot up 100 thousand points and is now tied for second place with Broderick and Benson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's a new name on the block. He wasn't in the top twenty, hell, not even in the top fifty, or even the top hundred before!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Holy smokes! He's ranked 108th on the strength leaderboard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Somebody that low-ranked went into the sixth layer? And managed to find an emblem and score 100 thousand points? How the hell did that happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of insane luck is that?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd's excited chatter made Angela look back up at the leaderboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There it was, plain as day&mdash;Osborne's name, bold and prominent in second place!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela was left completely </span><span>gobsmacked</span><span>.</span></p><div class="pagination">
