  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's right leg had undergone a transformation, absorbing the vast blood energy of Dark Deity Mosley, evolving into what was known as a Divine Bone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This Divine Bone was filled with divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, as he tapped into its strength, he felt his power surge to more than ten times its usual might. The sheer intensity was staggering; even Osborne didn</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>t know just how devastating this kick would be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he unleashed the full force of his right leg against the last solar orb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief silence, the final solar orb blasted violently. Although it was fused with Marlon's body and contained immense power, it paled when compared with the might of Osborne's Divine Bone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The orb exploded with a huge ferocity. Marlon, still connected to the orb, let out a horrific scream as the impact hit him like a freight train. He passed out before he could respond to the hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His bones shattered under the onslaught, and blood spewed from his mouth as he was thrown back, his body crumpling like a rag doll against the arena floor, twisted and unrecognizable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that instant, Marlon's Solar Realm crumbled around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in unconsciousness, he couldn't escape the mental backlash of its collapse, dark blood pooling at the corners of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body lay still as if he were lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surroundings turned eerily quiet. All eyes were glued to the arena, watching as Osborne slowly took back his right leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The audience felt that their hearts were pounding with the weight of disbelief and shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marlon was defeated!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne won!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Marlon's defeat, every young warrior on the Godson Rankings had fallen to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had cleared the Honor Quest Ceremony!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The audience was in a state of utter astonishment; even members of the Augustine family were too surprised to cheer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, someone whispered, "A legend has been born!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words ignited a spark that set off a wildfire of excitement throughout the venue. Cheers erupted, and the Augustine family members quickly regained their composure, faces flushed with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He did it! He won!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne won! He defeated Marlon! He defeated everyone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"128 wins in a row! He's taken them all down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's a legend!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's the first from the Augustine family to clear the Honor Quest Ceremony, the first from </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, the fourth in the world!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He won! Oh my gosh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many members of the Augustine family were so overwhelmed with pride that tears streamed down their faces. Yet, even though their tears, they stood tall, feeling very proud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa and Emma stared at Osborne, who stood bloodied and battered on the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was shattered, but there was an undeniable strength in his posture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood tall, like a sword piercing the sky, radiating an aura of invincibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his disheveled appearance, he seemed to embody a towering mountain, instilling awe in everyone around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa murmured, her eyes shining with excitement and pride for him, "Osborne, he did it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you're getting stronger! Don't worry, I'll keep up! I'll work hard and chase after you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other side, Emma gazed at Osborne with admiration, her eyes sparkling with affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s the man I chose!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She repeated it like a mantra, pride radiating from her flushed cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb stood nearby, staring at Osborne in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I always knew he was something special, but I never imagined he'd grow this fast, climb this high. He's so far above me now that I can barely see him when I look up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is a legend about to be born, one that surpasses Godfather?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Wesson watched Osborne from the high stands, his expression a mix of disbelief. His expectations for Osborne had been modest</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>just fifty consecutive wins. After all, Osborne was the grandson of Sebastian, and Wesson thought that fifty victories would be a reasonable benchmark for someone worthy of being Sebastian's heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne had completely blown those expectations out of the water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fifty wins?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was nothing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had cleared the Honor Quest Ceremony and defeated every challenger in his path!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson exclaimed softly, "Well!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian, your vision really was spot on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smile crept across Wesson's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Sebastian's butler, he was older than Sebastian, having witnessed the legendary figure achieve ninety-five consecutive wins in the Honor Quest Ceremony over forty years ago, cementing his place in the history of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Wesson was witnessing Osborne shine even brighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Sebastian was a legend for the Augustine family, a beacon for </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, then Osborne was destined to be a legend for the entire world!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the members of the Augustine family looked at Osborne, their faces glowing with pride and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, a sudden surge of terrifying power erupted in the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A voice roared, breaking the celebratory atmosphere, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
