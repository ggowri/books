Some had devoured six of them at the most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why everyone in the Augustine family was so shocked when they realized that Osborne had mastered the dark elemental power and had devoured at least five elemental essences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had surpassed Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The mutated Satan's Eye is so formidable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Osborne, everyone had jealousy on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, looked quite calm, thinking, "I have only devoured five elemental powers. Are they that surprised? If these people knew that I had actually devoured more than five elemental powers, and that I had devoured the wind elemental, water elemental, fire elemental, and metal elemental, a total of nine elemental essences, wouldn't they be scared to death? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Osborne felt that it was not his limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or rather, Osborne couldn't feel the limit at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He changed the topic and said, "I have won and the Rosenthal family have lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, everyone from the Augustine family realized what had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all looked incredulous, thinking, "Did we seriously win?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In such a desperate situation, Osborne finally managed to achieve an amazing comeback on behalf of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne defeated Aresta, Sene, Melanie, and Palmers in an unbelievable turnaround with his Class A+ power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the battle was over at this moment, everyone still couldn't believe it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He actually did it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew looked confused. "I didn't think Osborne would turn it around! How on earth did he do that? I thought Aresta, Sene, Melanie and Palmers were all stronger than </span><span>him, but why did he end up the winner?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew couldn't figure it out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't the only one who couldn't figure it out. At this moment, most of the Augustine family couldn't understand it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne did win, but each of his fights he won seemed unconvincing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aresta was seriously injured, and he wasn't at the peak of his power, so he lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sene didn't realize that Osborne also had light elemental power, so he lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melanie just happened to be restrained by Osborne's Death Sickle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Palmers also didn't expect that Osborne had the dark elemental power, so he lost so quickly before he could even show his true colors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the four wins, Osborne's opponents seemed to be better than him, but he ended up winning all of them for various reasons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Osborne's victory was followed by the impression that he was just lucky, he did win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, Nathan, Yulissa, and the others from the branch bloodline in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> were on their feet. They cheered loudly for Osborne, their faces flushed with excitement, and they felt incredibly thrilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He won!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you're awesome!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're invincible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People from the branch bloodline in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> cheered loudly. They finally livened up the atmosphere so that the Augustine family followed suit, cheering and looking excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether Osborne would be convinced by the others or not, he had won.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne won the bet, Godfather would get two divine artifacts, and the Augustine family would get another boost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, the Rosenthal family all looked embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather looked at them indifferently and said calmly, "Everett, you have lost! According to the bet agreement, you should hand over the two divine artifacts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett looked even more humiliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't even think that he would lose. At this moment, he had to hand over two divine artifacts, but he was reluctant, so he clenched his fists tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett said coldly, "Sebastian, I didn't realize that there was such a talented person hidden in the Augustine family. He has only reached Class A+ now, but if he improves, there will be few people in his class to be his opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's probably your secret weapon, isn't he? Do you think of him as your heir?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Everett finished speaking, the Augustine family, who had been so thrilled, fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all stared at Osborne and frowned tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Vincent, Matthew, Owen, and Emma all looked indignant and clenched their fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would Osborne be Godfather's heir?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a position they had dreamed of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne also frowned at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that Everett wasn't saying these things to compliment him but was setting him up, trying to get the Augustine family to infight over him and kill him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was nothing Osborne could do about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett was the Class S Supreme Overlord, and his praise was like a piece of bread with poison, which Osborne had to eat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather frowned slightly at this point, looking indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everett, cut the crap! It's not your turn to decide who my heir will be!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Godfather looked over at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least he's not even close right now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry up and hand over the divine artifacts. As the Class S Supreme Overlord, you won't break the contract, will you?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
