  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere inside the car became quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, their convoy arrived at the headquarters of Skyefall Security without any incident along the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Situated at the junction of Mayby City and Cloudsea City, Skyefall Security's headquarters spanned a vast canyon. It was heavily fortified with advanced defense installations and various high-power defensive weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was rumored that Skyefall Security could withstand an attack from an army of ten thousand men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The headquarters was divided into office and training areas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way, Apollo had contacted the top brass at Skyefall Security through the Chevalier family, expressing his intention to discuss business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of Skyefall Security executives was waiting at the entrance to greet them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo stepped out of the car, and several people immediately approached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading them was a woman in her thirties, still quite charming and attractive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a smile on her face, she said, "Mr. Chevalier, welcome to Skyefall Security. I am Judith Fox, the vice president of Skyefall Security."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo smiled faintly and shook her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few exchanged pleasantries, Judith invited Apollo and his party into the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some reason, Osborne felt annoyed by Judith's fawning attitude towards Apollo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyefall Security was now his company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Judith, his vice president, fawning over Apollo irked him. Although it was his first time meeting Judith, he already had a poor impression of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he had become the owner of Skyefall Security, he hadn't had a chance to come here and get to know Skyefall Security well. This was a good opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, did you see that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna whispered coldly in Osborne's ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Skyefall Security's vice president is currying favor with Apollo. She is the third most powerful person in Skyefall Security! Her attitude represents Skyefall Security's current stance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the past, Skyefall Security was a subsidiary of the Draco Group, and maybe they wouldn't care too much about the Chevalier family. But now that Skyefall Security has been sold, the attitudes of its top executives have naturally changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They won't refuse Apollo!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're sure to lose our bet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but smile faintly. Judith's attitude towards Apollo had nothing to do with Skyefall Security's overall stance. He, as the owner, hadn't even said anything yet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He replied calmly, "She's just a vice president. She can't decide anything significant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph, keep deluding yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna ignored Osborne and followed the crowd into the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Fox, where is your new boss?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have a significant business deal to discuss directly with your boss. Please ask them to come here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the office, Apollo spoke with an air of arrogance as if to say Judith was unworthy of negotiating with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judith's expression turned awkward upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Chevalier, I apologize, but I currently do not know where our new boss is or even who he is. Only our general manager knows the boss' identity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo furrowed his brow upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt Judith's words were just brushing him off. He thought to himself, "How could a vice president not even know who the new boss is? To buy Skyefall Security would take at least several billion dollars, even up to tens of billions of dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a person definitely isn't insignificant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bought Skyefall Security, and he hasn't even shown his face? What exactly is he after?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo stared at Judith closely but saw that she didn't seem to be lying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned and said, "Forget it, then! What I want to discuss today is your Class A defense system. I want to lease it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo didn't waste any more time and stated his purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judith looked even more embarrassed. "I'm sorry, Mr. Chevalier. If it were any other business, I could make the decision and give you the best terms to ensure cooperation. But for the Class A defense system, I don't have the authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only the boss and the general manager can decide on that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo's face showed anger. "Then what are you waiting for? Call your general manager! Do you think I have all day?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Judith quickly apologized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, Mr. Chevalier. I've already contacted the general manager. He was at the training ground but will be here shortly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He better hurry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo snapped, no longer paying attention to Judith, leaving her deeply embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Skyefall Security was sold by the Draco Group, she had been anxious, worried that without the Draco Group's backing, Skyefall Security would decline. Not only would they lose their lofty status, but they might also face operational difficulties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Apollo from the powerful Chevalier family, she hoped to curry favor to secure her future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Apollo couldn't be bothered to pay attention to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo turned to Clarissa with a confident and proud expression. "Clarissa, don't worry. I'll get that Class A defense system for you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one can refuse me."</span></p><div class="pagination">
