  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was still reeling from the backlash of self-destructing three Realms. Blood poured from his mouth, his face pale as a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He barely had time to process his pain before his eyes landed on the still-standing Plant Realm, shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why? With close to a thousand people attacking, alongside dozens of Realm self-detonations, we haven't managed to shatter Sin's Plant Realm?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's gaze locked onto Sin with an intensity that could burn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a peal of laughter rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned to see Crimson laughed in Sin&rsquo;s arms despite blood at her lips. Her vitality was extremely low, yet her eyes glinted with hatred as they bore into him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She taunted, her voice dripping with malice, "Osborne, are you feeling desperate?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think your attacks hit my husband's Plant Realm? Think again! I used my Dark Realm to deflect all of them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, it's your turn to face hell!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sin! Finish them off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crimson shouted, her eyes seething with fire as they fixed on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words pierced through the haze of confusion in Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression turned grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would have thought that despite her wounds, Crimson was willing to risk her life to protect Sin with her Realm?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Sin's Plant Realm still intact, their situation had grown dire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't mount another assault like that again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, my love. I swear I'll wipe them out&mdash;revenge for you and our daughter!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell! All of you!" Sin growled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, from within that relentless Plant Realm, more vines and roots </span><span>shot out like gigantic whips, blocking out the sky as they came crashing down upon everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, Greyson, and Roy&mdash;targeted by Sin's fury&mdash;were sent crashing through the air, their bodies battered as they spewed blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of Lambert family members exploded inside bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face twisted in anguish. If they didn't come up with a plan soon, they would all die here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The power gap is just too vast!" Osborne thought, his fists clenched tight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd already used too much strength, and now, facing a new round of attacks, he found even self-preservation to be a struggle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He failed to fight against Sin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to a top-tier Class S like Sin, his Class AAA status felt laughable. No matter how hard he fought, he was outmatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I really going to die here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt the despair creeping in as he was flung away again by Sin's relentless strikes. Frustration gnawed at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I could just break through to Class S, even if I couldn't take Sin down, I'd never find myself in a situation like this! I wouldn't let him kill my people so easily!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hunger for power gripped him, a desperate longing to ascend to Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew he was strong&mdash;strong enough to take out many Class S opponents with ease&mdash;but it still wasn't enough! He had to evolve further to live fearlessly in this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, transforming to Class S from Class AAA wasn't an easy feat; it was a colossal leap, a transformative journey that couldn't be forced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time and time again, Osborne felt Sin's attacks hurl him away, leaving him battered and broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the Lambert family, they were beginning to falter under the relentless assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each strike from Sin resulted in a multitude of their members exploding, and now only about six hundreds of them remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once formidable Class S duo of Greyson and Roy now lay grievously wounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the relentless onslaught, it seemed their extinction was imminent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All around, the Lambert family faced utter despair as they beheld Sin's monstrous Plant Realm, a canopy of colossal roots and vines that seemed to blot out the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this the end for us?" they murmured. They couldn&rsquo;t defend Sin's attacks anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as all hope seemed lost, a deafening rumble erupted from within Sin's Plant Realm. The realm shook violently, as if struck by an external force of unimaginable power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within moments, the Plant Realm's structure fractured and, shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin, taken by surprise, spat out a mouthful of blood and looked up, shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There, in the skies above, he spotted a swarm of helicopters approaching with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they could even touch down, figures began leaping out. There were 500 of them, most of whom are Class AAA warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was this force that had breached and shattered Sin's Plant Realm from the outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were members of the Blood Demon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, witnessing the descent of the Blood Demon warriors, swiftly wiped the blood from his lips, a cold, vindictive smile spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally!" Osborne muttered, glaring at the now visibly nervous Sin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Had your fun, didn't you? Well, now it's my turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All Blood Demon members, listen up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
