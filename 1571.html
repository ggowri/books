  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bruno, a late-stage Celestial Deity with a reputation for holding his own against even peak Celestial Deities, never anticipated Osborne's sudden assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, he was thrown against the unforgiving walls of the mine, his Divine Body shattering on impact. The sound of cracking bones reverberated through the cavern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You... You..." Bruno stammered, blood trickling from his mouth. His voice was weak, but his eyes burned with a mix of rage and disbelief as he shakily pointed at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's lips curled into a mocking smile. "Surprised? Confused? Let me guess&mdash;you're wondering why I turned on you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He strolled toward Bruno with unhurried steps, exuding calm menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bruno, visibly panicked, scrambled backward, his eyes darting toward a specific spot in the shadows, silently pleading for help. But there was no response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, why are you doing this?" Bruno's voice cracked with desperation. "I treated you like a brother! I brought you here for glory, and this is how you repay me?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne chuckled coldly. "A brother? Glory? Do you think I'm stupid, Bruno? Save your sob story."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes narrowed, and a chilling edge crept into his tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bruno's face twisted, a flicker of panic betraying his otherwise calm facade. "You've got it all wrong! I didn't mean to make you suspicious!" he stammered. "This wasn't even my idea&mdash;it was my uncle's! Laird truly wants to recruit you. We're here to help, I swear!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He shuffled backward, edging ever closer to Guy's hiding spot, his movements carefully calculated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne followed, his demeanor still calm but his smile sharper than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bruno's heart raced as the plan seemed to come together. The trap was set, and Guy was ready to strike from the shadows. Bruno's initial panic was replaced with a glimmer of excitement. Osborne was walking right into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne suddenly stopped in his tracks, his gaze piercing. "Bruno, you know your acting skills are terrible, right? Did you really think I'd fall for this pathetic setup? I'm done playing along."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bruno froze mid-step, his excitement extinguished in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"W... What are you talking about? I don't understand..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne rolled his eyes. "Oh, please. Do I really need to explain? Fine, let's wrap this up. I'd like to get back to something more productive. Guy, are you seriously still hiding? Doesn't it feel a little cramped back there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bruno's face went pale, and an eerie silence enveloped the space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smirked, his voice dripping with mockery. "Come on, Guy. You didn't think I'd notice, did you? Why don't you come out and join us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a flick of his finger, Osborne unleashed a streak of energy that materialized into a roaring thunder dragon. The dragon tore through the air and struck a massive boulder several hundred yards away, obliterating it in a deafening explosion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From the debris emerged a figure, stumbling out with a scowl etched deep on his face. It was Guy. His cold, piercing eyes locked onto Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How did you find me?" Guy demanded, his tone laced with frustration. "I concealed my presence perfectly&mdash;no energy leaks, no traces. What gave me away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne chuckled, his expression calm. He wasn't about to reveal that his Satan's Eye gave him unparalleled vision. Instead, he smirked. "You hid well, Guy, but your nephew? Not so much. He kept glancing at your hiding spot. If I hadn't noticed that, maybe I'd have fallen for it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy's eyes blazed with fury. He turned to Bruno, his rage boiling over. "You incompetent fool!" he roared, delivering a vicious kick that sent Bruno sprawling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You had one job! ONE! And you couldn't even manage that! If you weren't my nephew, I'd kill you right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bruno, already battered, coughed up blood from the impact. He lay dazed, unable to respond, shame written all over his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy redirected his cold gaze back to Osborne. "You're clever, I'll give you that. But your biggest mistake was sticking around once you figured me out. That arrogance will be your undoing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a sinister grin, Guy raised his hand. Divine energy surged through the air, forming a radiant shield around them. The energy hummed, crackling with raw power as the shield sealed off every escape route.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The ambush may have failed, but you're not getting out alive," Guy sneered. "This is a top-tier divine power shield. There's no breaking it. So, Osborne, tell me&mdash;how do you want to die?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
