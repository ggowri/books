  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Quinn, you disappoint me! You got defeated so quickly! I haven't even had enough fun yet! How could you fall already? You're so useless, it makes me angry!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was furious, filled with killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After spitting out another mouthful of blood, Quinn struggled to stand up. At this moment, Osborne made him feel stiff all over and utterly terrified.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne seemed genuinely angry because he was too useless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This realization angered Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I am the most outstanding prince of the Royal Family, a Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior. Even on the entire Racial Convergence Planet, I am one of the top warriors. Yet Osborne dares to call me useless?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He's angry because I'm too useless?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Has he lost his mind?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, Osborne was indeed angry because Quinn was too weak. After all, the anger and frustration in his heart hadn't been vented yet, but Quinn had already fallen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He put away the Bloodwrought Bow and took out the Warfare Scythe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stared at Quinn and said coldly, "One more time! This time, try to block a few more of my moves so I can have some fun! Otherwise, if I get angry, I'll skin your flesh piece by piece!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quinn instantly felt fear, followed by anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He roared, "Osborne, you damn bastard! How dare you humiliate me? I&rsquo;ll fight you to the death!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He launched another frenzied attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, swiftly dodged Quinn's attack, appeared behind him, and swung the Warfare Scythe forward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His sharp Warfare Scythe easily tore through Quinn's Sacred Artifact Armor, leaving a deep wound on his back as blood spurted out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quinn screamed in pain and spun around wildly to strike back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, in Osborne's eyes, Quinn was still too slow. He teleported instantly, dodged Quinn's attack again, appeared behind him once more, and swiftly swung the Warfare Scythe at his back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quinn's already damaged Sacred Artifact Armor became even more shattered. Another deep wound appeared on his back, exposing his bones.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quinn screamed again in agony. At this point, he was on the verge of losing it. Osborne's Warfare Scythe was too sharp, and Quinn's Sacred Artifact Armor and Sacred Power Defense couldn't withstand it at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, Osborne's Sacred Power carried an extremely intense corrosive force. After his body was slashed, it brought him pain ten or even a hundred times stronger, making him unable to suppress his screams.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quinn went completely mad, attacking wildly in all directions. Unfortunately, Osborne was just too fast. He moved around Quinn, dodging all his attacks while leaving deep wounds all over his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quinn was soon covered in blood, which flowed down like a stream.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt bewildered and became terrified.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't beat Osborne at all!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In ranged combat, Quinn was directly defeated by Osborne with the Bloodwrought Bow, and in close combat, he was completely toyed with by Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was like a tiger playing with a rabbit!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quinn had no power to fight back at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he felt fear and despair. His fear of Osborne reached its peak, just like when he faced Frederick!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's Warfare Scythe slashed Quinn's face, even blinding one of his eyes, causing him to let out a piercing scream.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, Quinn fell.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As his body trembled violently, he watched Osborne continue slashing at his body, his chest, his thighs, his arms, and even his face...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne's face was cold and filled with anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was truly venting!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda's accident was caused by Naomi, the Grand Princess of the Royal Family. Quinn was also one of them, so Osborne's anger was entirely taken out on him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that moment, a loud bang was heard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Invictus Field surrounding Osborne and Quinn was suddenly shattered from the outside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Frederick appeared in Osborne's sight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick looked at the utterly miserable Quinn, whose flesh was being sliced off piece by piece by Osborne. His gaze instantly turned icy as he stared at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You bastard, you actually didn't hide and still dared to come out courting death!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne struck Quinn with another slash. After a scream, Quinn finally fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne finally stopped as well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He grabbed the unconscious Quinn and stuffed him into the Dimensional Bag like a piece of cargo. Then, he slowly raised his head and looked at Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Emperor Frederick, you arrived quite quickly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Too bad, you're late! Quinn has already been dealt with by me like a dead dog."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne showed a bright smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick's face was extremely grim. Though he was ruthless and cruel, he would only kill his own child with his own hands.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When others harmed his child in front of him, he would, of course, be furious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Frederick was extremely furious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wasted no words and launched an attack directly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You bastard, today I'll kill you completely, send you to hell, and reunite you with your wretched mother!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick struck out with a palm, terrifying power quickly forming into a massive hand, crushing toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne became serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Slash!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He swiftly swung the Warfare Scythe, unleashing power and slashing down fiercely, aiming to break Frederick's massive Sacred Power-infused palm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud bang, Osborne spat out a mouthful of blood. His body was flung far away, and his face turned somewhat pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Such a powerful attack!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne squinted his eyes. Frederick was much stronger than Quinn. Osborne had just unleashed his full Sacred Power, yet he still couldn't withstand Frederick's attack and had already suffered a minor injury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although his minor injuries could be healed instantly with the power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, he knew very well that he was still no match for Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only Adriana can confront Frederick!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if Osborne used the Warfare Scythe, Bloodwrought Bow, or even the Apocalypse Bow, he might still not be able to seriously injure Frederick!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, he had already used the Apocalypse Bow. At least for today, he couldn't use it again, making it even more impossible for him to be a match for Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered, "Emperor Frederick, you are indeed strong, but you can't kill me! If you have the guts, come and chase me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he used spatial power and vanished instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick's face was extremely grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His full-force strike was actually blocked by Osborne with a scythe that was a Superior Sacred Artifact, which left Frederick utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He roared, "You bastard, you're just an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warrior, yet you possess such terrifying power! If you keep fighting, I fear I won't even sleep peacefully!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In that case, I'll kill you today!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You want to escape? Dream on!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick, filled with killing intent, instantly disappeared and swiftly pursued in the direction Osborne fled.</span></p><div class="pagination">
