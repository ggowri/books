  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What gift?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa asked, her curiosity piqued. Though she did not care much about gifts, this was the first one from Osborne, and she could not help but look forward to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly, "You will love it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He discreetly opened his Dimensional Space, using Clarissa's body as a cover, and retrieved an exquisite wooden box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the wooden box, Clarissa was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She did not know Osborne had spatial power, but she wisely refrained from asking, focusing instead on the wooden box with growing anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Open it and take a look," Osborne said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa nodded eagerly and slowly opened the wooden box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, a brilliant light emanated from within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she saw what was inside, her eyes widened in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She carefully took out the crown from the wooden box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, it is called the Crown of Fate," Osborne explained. "It is named so because it symbolizes taking our destinies into our own hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only you are worthy of its brilliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me help you put it on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's body trembled slightly as she gazed at the crown, her eyes sparkling with delight. No woman could resist the allure of the Crown of Fate, and she was no exception.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crown was stunningly beautiful, with a perfect teardrop diamond the size of a baby's fist, even larger and more brilliant than the one on the </span><span>Yalynch</span><span> queen's scepter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It also featured two heart-shaped Imperial Green diamonds, each worth billions of </span><span>dollars, capable of melting any girl's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Designed by the top designer Alison, the Crown of Fate's dazzling display left everyone in awe, their eyes unable to look away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gently took the Crown of Fate and carefully placed it on Clarissa's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, a radiant light shone, making Clarissa look like a queen, unmatched in beauty. The Crown of Fate's splendor perfectly complemented her exquisite appearance, making everyone feel ashamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one dared to look directly at Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, you look beautiful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, unable to take his eyes off her. Clarissa blushed, her eyes misting with emotion as she bit her lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I love it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Crown of Fate! From now on, we will take control of our destinies!" Clarissa exclaimed, then stood on tiptoe to kiss Osborne again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could feel her body trembling, both excited and emotional.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the occasion was inappropriate for more intimate actions, so Osborne could only hold her waist gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the crowd, Austin stared blankly at Osborne and Clarissa kissing, her eyes fixed on the Crown of Fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart ached as if being squeezed, but soon she smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They really suit each other. Perhaps only Osborne is worthy of Clarissa, and only Clarissa is worthy of Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Austin, you were just an accident; you have no right to ask for more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least, he will be the father of your child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, Clarissa, I wish you happiness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin murmured before turning to leave without disturbing anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long time, the two finally parted lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa finally let go of Osborne, hugging his arm with a radiant smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her already stunning face became even more enchanting with her smile, overshadowing every other woman present, including the bride, Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia stood there blankly, as everything around her seemed to disappear, leaving only Osborne and Clarissa kissing, and the Crown of Fate on Clarissa's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No woman could resist the brilliance of Crown of Fate, and Ophelia was no exception.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the jewelry worth three hundred million dollars she borrowed from Wesley's grandmother seemed dull and insignificant, making her, the bride, fade into obscurity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one cared about her anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even Wesley, who was also staring at Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anger surged within Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "The Crown of Fate was a gift from Osborne to Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Osborne was my ex-husband!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A month ago, Osborne and I were still married. If he had given me the Crown of Fate, </span><span>I would never have divorced him, even if it meant going against my family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did Osborne give such a precious Crown of Fate to Clarissa and not me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Ophelia got a broken heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "I could not accept Osborne being with Clarissa. I could not accept my once worthless ex-husband becoming the center of attention and being with Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wanted to ruin everything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Ophelia erupted.</span></p><div class="pagination">
