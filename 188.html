  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna ran over here quickly and glared at Osborne with great anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what do you want to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna couldn't stop Clarissa from talking to Osborne alone, so she could only leave temporarily. But she hadn't gone far because she was worried that Osborne would do something bad to Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she sneaked closer to check what they were talking about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she saw Osborne holding Clarissa's hand and leaning over to kiss Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Donna was utterly furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She even ignored that Clarissa closed her eyes and raised her chin slightly in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna felt Osborne was forcing Clarissa!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I trust you so much, but you dare to disrespect Clarissa? You're courting death! Get out of here! Get out of the Radcliffe Manor right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna cursed through gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne touched his nose awkwardly. Just now, he couldn't help himself. He had wanted to kiss Clarissa but was caught by Donna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when Donna asked him to get out, he frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to speak when he suddenly felt someone holding his hand tightly. He looked down and found that it was Clarissa's delicate hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was suddenly surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa took a deep breath and stood in front of Osborne, facing Donna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Donna, why did you ask Osborne to leave? Osborne didn't flirt with me. Osborne is my boyfriend, and I am his girlfriend. He wanted to kiss me, and I was willing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing speaking, Clarissa suddenly blushed, but her eyes were steadfast. She looked straight at Donna without a trace of retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned, looking at Clarissa in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa interrupted Osborne, her pretty face flushed as she said, "Osborne, I told you, we will bear our fate and face obstacles and difficulties together from now on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne trembled. Then, he nodded and said nothing more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna was also stunned at this moment. She looked at Clarissa, who had a determined face, in disbelief. Listening to Clarissa's words and watching Clarissa holding Osborne's hand, she was trembling slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Donna!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa interrupted Donna and added, "Aunt Donna, I know what you want to say. You want to say that I am engaged and that I am the Fatebearer of the Radcliffe family. You also want to say that Osborne is not worthy of me and the elders will not agree. Right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna froze immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa held Osborne's hand tighter and said seriously, "Aunt Donna, I know what you are worried about. Osborne also knows it! But we have decided to face it together. We don't care about that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Clarissa turned to look at Osborne. Her eyes were extremely gentle, and her pretty face was full of a happy smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she no longer had her usual cold appearance. She no longer looked like an eternal iceberg but like a blooming flower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne also smiled slightly, holding Clarissa tightly and looking straight at Donna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna suddenly calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She saw a seriousness and determination in Clarissa's eyes that she had never seen before, and she also saw happiness and hope on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was completely different from the Clarissa in her memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa had rarely smiled since she was five years old. She seemed to have shut herself off, and no one could get close to her anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone thought that it was not a problem, and Clarissa's personality was just like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Donna understood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was not cold-hearted. She just had endured too much. Her fate had already been arranged when she was five years old. So how could she be happy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, in front of Osborne, she finally showed her true self.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Donna suddenly felt sorry for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could you bear it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, the fate power in you is not something that Osborne can bear. If you stay with him, you will kill him! Even the Radcliffe family will fall because of you two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one will support you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's more, Apollo will not give up. He will not agree to cancel the engagement. And he will kill Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna sighed after those words. She was Clarissa's biological aunt and watched Clarissa grow up. She treated Clarissa as her daughter and was more attentive to Clarissa than to her son, Barlyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Donna not want Clarissa to be happy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Donna not know Apollo was not a good man?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she couldn't change anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was the Fatebearer of the Radcliffe family. Her fate had long been determined, and it was not something Donna could change, nor was it something Clarissa and Osborne could change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why can't we bear it? Osborne..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa seemed to want to explain, but Osborne stopped her and said calmly, "Ms. Donna Radcliffe, we have already considered all the things you are worried about. I don't think I can't bear it, and I don't think Apollo can kill me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, Clarissa is already with me. We don't care if others try to stop us, but I hope you can support us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are very important to Clarissa!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your support is also very important to her!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
