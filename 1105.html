  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reginald, Everett, and the other members of the League of Divine Descent were utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't believe it. Out of nowhere, four hundred Class S warriors had emerged, all wearing the same combat gear as the Blood Demon members, clearly allies!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Considering the flawless teamwork of the Blood Demon members, the League of Divine Descent's morale plummeted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were four hundred Class S warriors!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't just four hundred Class AAA fighters!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Globally, only a handful of superpowers could claim to possess such a formidable force of Class S warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Prophet Alliance, the League of Divine Descent itself, and the Eityreia Organization were the only entities capable of deploying more than four hundred Class S warriors with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apart from these, there was only Gerardo, who had managed to amass over four hundred Class S warriors through cloning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family, by all accounts, should not have anywhere near this many Class S warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not four hundred, not even forty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, at this moment, the sudden appearance of these four hundred Class S warriors struck fear into their hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's command rang out, and the newly arrived Blood Demon warriors sprang into action. Although they had only recently advanced to Class S and were not as individually powerful as the seasoned Class S warriors of the League of Divine Descent, their seamless coordination made up for any shortfall in strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, they were supported by the 4,000-plus Class AAA Blood Demon warriors!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle erupted with a force that shook the entire valley. Over seven hundred Class S warriors and more than four thousand Class AAA fighters clashed in a cataclysmic showdown, causing the ground to tremble and the gorge to crumble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tall trees were uprooted and toppled, creating a scene that looked like the end of the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson, Greyson, Bryce, and the others were left speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stared at Osborne in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't have imagined that Osborne had such a powerful hidden card that a force of four hundred Class S warriors at his command. Feeling the combined assault of these warriors, even they felt a chill of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson finally understood why Osborne had remained so calm, even when the Blood Demon members appeared to be on the losing side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he knew Osborne had such reinforcements waiting, he would have no reason to panic!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tide of battle swiftly turned one-sided. The 300-plus Class S warriors from the League of Divine Descent were indeed a formidable force, but they were facing the Blood Demon warriors!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, the 4,000-plus Class AAA Blood Demon members alone had managed to hold off the combined assault from the League of Divine Descent for a considerable amount of time. Now, with the addition of the 400 Class S Blood Demon warriors, their momentum surged, completely overwhelming the League of Divine Descent's Class S warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The League of Divine Descent's Class S warriors, coming from various families and lacking any real teamwork, were formidable against weaker opponents but fell short against the coordinated Blood Demon forces. The Blood Demon warriors, synchronized in their attacks and greater in number, dominated the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was filled with the agonizing screams of the League of Divine Descent warriors as they fell one by one to the relentless assault of the Blood Demon forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson, Bryce, Greyson, and the others could only stand by in stunned silence, mere spectators to the carnage unfolding before them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had been right. The Blood Demon members' coordination was so perfect that any outside interference would only disrupt their efficiency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were more than content to be bystanders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the once arrogant and overconfident League of Divine Descent's Class S warriors get cut down one after another by the Blood Demon fighters filled them with a deep sense of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You damned fools!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Reginald was utterly frantic, forced to reveal his terrifying strength. Yet, surrounded by the Blood Demon members, he was like a tiger trapped in quicksand. Despite his immense power, he was completely unable to kill even a single Blood Demon warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His attacks were dispersed among the group, and although he managed to injure some Blood Demon members, he couldn't kill any of them. The Crystals of Life they carried quickly healed their wounds, neutralizing his efforts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon warriors roared as their momentum grew stronger. They were killing more and more of the League of Divine Descent's warriors with each passing second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was now clear to everyone watching that the League of Divine Descent's Class S forces were doomed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Break out! Save whoever can be saved!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Reginald shouted orders to his remaining forces. Desperate to escape, he led a charge to break through the encirclement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Out of my way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a surge of desperate power, Reginald unleashed a devastating attack, managing to blast hundreds of Blood Demon members aside, creating a temporary opening in the siege.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he darted through the gap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the next second, the Blood Demon warriors closed the breach once more, trapping those who attempted to follow Reginald in their grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, only four managed to escape with Reginald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them was Everett, along with three other top-tier Class S warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After breaking through the encirclement, the five survivors fled in a wild panic, not daring to look back or help their remaining comrades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn the Augustine family! You'll pay for this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The League of Divine Descent won't let you get away with this!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
