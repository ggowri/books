  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Supreme Sovereign's Armor could withstand the attacks of a peak Deity King, but it wasn't invincible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the relentless assault from Hubery, even that formidable defense began to crack. Finally, the armor shattered, and Hubery's overwhelming power slammed into Zoe's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe was sent crashing to the ground, blood erupting from her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, much of Hubery's strength had been spent breaching the armor, or that single blow might have been enough to end her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, even though she was still alive, death was a breath away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you really think you could stop me? You're asking for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery sneered, his intent to finish her off clear as he launched a barrage of attacks aimed at utterly obliterating Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As it seemed she would be engulfed by Hubery's fury, Anastasia, Kendra, and the others were too injured to come to her aid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when despair threatened to take hold, a sudden twist of fate occurred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A spatial fluctuation surrounded Zoe, and in an instant, she vanished from her spot. Hubery's terrifying strike landed where she had just been, creating a massive crater in the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Zoe was unharmed, now cradled in Osborne's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression darkened as he looked at the blood-soaked Zoe, a storm of anger brewing within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You had it coming!" Osborne's voice was low and dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had poured every ounce of his energy into breaking the dark energy of Lord Malevolence from Bryce's body, allowing for a rapid recovery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in that same minute, Anastasia, Kendra, Mila, and Diana had been gravely injured trying to buy him time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most gravely injured of all was Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe had stood her ground against Hubery's unrelenting assault for a full thirty seconds, all by herself. Even clad in her Supreme Sovereign's Armor, the sheer brutality of Hubery's attacks had left her battered beyond belief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne had acted just a heartbeat later, Zoe would have been reduced to ashes by Hubery's lethal blows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Osborne not feel his blood boil at the sight?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The memory of Zoe standing in front of him, bloody and broken but unyielding, her words still ringing in his ears, "Want to hurt Osborne? You'll have to kill me first," had shaken him to his very core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it wasn't too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Zoe was gravely wounded, Osborne had the power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity at his disposal. He channeled its energy into her, and her injuries began to heal rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe gasped, still weak but her eyes sparkling with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne! I didn't let you down! We held him off for a full minute!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, gently ruffling her hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You all did amazing! Especially you, Zoe. You were incredibly brave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's cheeks flushed with pride, her heart swelling at his praise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly turned his attention to the others, using the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to heal Anastasia, Kendra, Mila, Diana, and even Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zoe, you need to fall back!" Osborne instructed, positioning himself protectively in front of the group as he faced Hubery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression turned icy, a fierce killing intent radiating from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery scoffed, his own eyes flashing with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can intimidate me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Theodore, your Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings are as good as dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dared to kill Caesar, and there's no one who can save you now! You're finished!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air around Hubery crackled with power as he prepared to unleash his fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne laughed coldly. "The only one who's going to die here is you! You dare to harm my sister? I'll make sure you pay for that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of his hand, eight Spatial Clones appeared behind him, ready to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's laughter echoed, "Spatial Clones? They won't save you! Your level is far too low to match my strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever tricks you have up your sleeve, they won't work against me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I'll send you to your grave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery struck again, completely ignoring Osborne. Spatial Clone or no Spatial Clone, and even the fact that Osborne had once suppressed Caesar meant nothing to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because he was a peak Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lie down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying wave of power surged towards Osborne, devoid of any finesse&mdash;pure brute force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scoffed and retaliated with a powerful punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thunderous explosion erupted in midair as their forces collided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The resulting shockwave nearly scattered the Eclipse Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stumbled backwards, leaving massive craters in his wake. His face was pale, and blood trickled from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A peak Deity King's strength was incredibly overwhelming!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne struggled to withstand a direct confrontation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just one move had left him with a minor injury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery smirked in derision. "You're out of your depth! I said today, you all die here! You, Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, will be Caesar's sacrifice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, several figures suddenly materialized around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They swiftly dispersed, surrounding Osborne and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their auras were formidable, each one a late-stage Deity King!</span></p><div class="pagination">
