  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Transforming the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow into a Sacred Artifact was Osborne's goal, but he was feeling a bit uncertain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the past three days, he had already used more than a thousand Azure Ores to enhance the bow. Now, it was incredibly powerful&mdash;arguably one of the finest Apex divine artifacts in this cosmos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, despite his efforts, the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow showed no signs of wanting to evolve into a Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With only eight hundred Azure Ores remaining, he was unsure whether using them would be enough to trigger the transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided to hold off for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the enhancements he had made had pushed the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow to its temporary limits. Osborne could almost sense the materials of the bow growing weary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Continuing to push it might not only fail to make it stronger but could risk breaking it altogether.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow needs more than just Azure Ore to transform into a Sacred Artifact. It might require other rare materials to enhance its very essence," he mused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda broke into his thoughts. "Osborne, what's our next move? We've been in this Umbra Earth for twenty-four days already! According to the head of the Ethereal Elven Temple, we have to leave within a month. If we're still here when Umbra Earth returns to Umbra World, we could be crushed by the overwhelming forces at the barrier! That gives us only six days left to explore this place! Should we keep meditating, or should we push deeper?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at him, ready to defer the decision to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment before responding, "With just six days left, meditating won't yield much more power. Besides, my clones are still in the Corrosive Marsh, collecting Azure Ore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think we should continue deeper.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uriel's exploration team has also entered the Corrosive Marsh, but my clones haven't encountered them yet. They must have moved further into the Umbra Earth.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We should go and see what treasures lie ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda nodded in agreement. "I was thinking the same! Uriel knows this place better than we do. If he hasn't lingered in the Corrosive Marsh and has moved on, it's a sure sign that there are more valuable things deeper in. Even if we can't get them ourselves, we need to follow and see!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, "Let's go then!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After spending over three days in the Corrosive Marsh, the two set off once more, this time at a much quicker pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his Satan's Eye having reached the Sacredness Level, Osborne's enhanced vision and danger-sensing abilities meant he no longer worried about ambushes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once treacherous Corrosive Marsh now felt like a stroll through a garden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just half a day, Osborne guided Alfreda through the vast expanse of the Corrosive Marsh using interdimensional travel, emerging on the third platform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ahead lay a thick blanket of darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stormy clouds above, crackling with lightning, seemed to nearly touch the ground, creating an oppressive atmosphere. To an ordinary person, it would have felt like staring into a terrifying abyss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But through Osborne's Satan's Eye, everything was crystal clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What lay before them was a massive plain, littered with enormous bones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The skeletal remains were unlike anything they had ever seen, their forms so bizarre that it was impossible to identify the creatures they once belonged to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only commonality was their sheer size; even the smallest bones towered like small mountains, standing at least a hundred yards tall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every toe bone they passed was larger than Osborne's entire body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight left him momentarily speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong?" Alfreda asked, her curiosity piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the Nature Elf Clan had their own special techniques to enhance vision, they paled in comparison to Osborne's Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her, the scene was just a dark, misty landscape shrouded in ominous clouds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could sense something unsettling but couldn't quite grasp what it was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Osborne pointed ahead. "We're looking at a Skeletal Wasteland! Countless massive bones rise like mountains all around us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Skeletal Wasteland?" Alfreda's expression shifted to one of concern. "Are those bones from creatures of Umbra World?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded gravely. "They probably are.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In Prince Chuck's 'Heavenly Compendium of All Beings', there are records of most intelligent beings in this universe, but none of these bones match what's described.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These remains likely belong to creatures that perished in Umbra World."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He inhaled deeply, determination flickering in his eyes. "Let's go take a closer look!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne led Alfreda into the heart of the Skeletal Wasteland, approaching the nearest colossal bone structure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, they stood before a bone towering three hundred yards high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda </span><span>gasped,</span><span> her eyes wide with astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's an enormous skeleton! Too bad it's so decayed! It must have lost its divine power long ago&mdash;this thing has probably been dead for over ten thousand years, maybe even longer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded in agreement, sensing the absence of any divine energy. The bones had succumbed to the relentless passage of time, becoming incredibly fragile. A mere push could shatter them into dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They must have been incredibly powerful in life," he remarked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda added, "Creatures from Umbra World are inherently formidable!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The </span><span>Ghostwing</span><span> Insect, Phantom Worm, </span><span>Soulreaver</span><span> Vine, and even the Mud Golem we encountered earlier aren't true Umbra Earth intelligent beings, yet they were still so strong. The owners of these bones must have been even more powerful!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still, I doubt they ever reached Empyrean Sacredness. The bodies and bones of Empyrean Sacredness warriors wouldn't decay, even after millennia. They still radiate faint waves of Sacred Power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He considered the implications. "Bones from Empyrean Sacredness warriors would make excellent materials for crafting Sacred Artifacts..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze drifted deeper into the Skeletal Wasteland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's keep going! I have a feeling the deeper we venture, the stronger the bones will be. We might even come across the remains of an Empyrean Sacredness warrior!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's eyes lit up at the thought. "Let's do it! I'm all in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they pressed further into the Skeletal Wasteland, Osborne couldn't shake the odd feeling that they hadn't encountered any danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Satan's Eye scanned the surroundings relentlessly, but everything seemed eerily calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It looks like there are signs of recent passage over there! Those tracks must be ten days old, likely left by Uriel's exploration team. They probably entered the Skeletal Wasteland around the same time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow. "</span><span>So</span><span> they've been here for over ten days?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That means they didn't stop in the Death Chasm or the Corrosive Marsh!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They came straight here.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What could possibly be so enticing that they'd abandon the treasures in those places?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His curiosity was piqued, growing stronger with each step.</span></p><div class="pagination">
