  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda accepted King Ainsworth's punishment proposal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her icy face was filled with scorn as she sneered, "It's nothing more than a trip to Umbra Earth to fetch ten Flame Gold Crystals for your daughter Monica. It is a piece of cake!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But let me say this: give</span><span>n</span><span> your daughter Monica's talent, even if you gave her a hundred Flame Gold Crystals, she would never measure up to me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You had better warn her that if she remains weak, she must work harder. This time she's dealing with me; if she meets someone with an even more violent temper, she might not even live long enough to come back and complain!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"King Ainsworth, now kindly take your leave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alfreda sent him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ainsworth's face darkened as he glared at her, his eyes flashing danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You insolent girl. You are so arrogant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda simply scoffed with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriah quickly stepped in front of her, his expression impassive as he said, "King Ainsworth, we have already agreed to your punishment proposal. Now, we are done here. Please leave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ainsworth snorted coldly. Realizing he had no reason to stay, he cast a final glance at Uriah, Alfreda, and Sherwood, said nothing more, and turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence fell over the grand hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long moment, Uriah sighed, "Alfreda, you were too impulsive this time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda said disapprovingly, "Father, don't worry. It's just a trip to Umbra Earth. I'm not afraid! This time, dozens of princes and princesses from all the great royal families are leading expeditions to Umbra Earth, and I can join them. It won't be dangerous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriah shook his head. "It isn't as simple as you think. Ainsworth proposed this scheme for a reason. They might have ulterior motives waiting for you. Besides, Umbra Earth itself is fraught with danger. To return safely from there while also bringing back ten Flame Gold Crystals is a tall order!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, you have never left Elf City since you were born. You lack any real experience..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, Uriah furrowed his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Most importantly, the Elven Mother Tree is now in a period of dormancy, which means our Nature Kingdom's strength is at its weakest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Nature Kingdom can offer you little support. You will have to form your entire expedition team by yourself. That is... far too dangerous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queen Hilaria, who had remained silent until now, frowned and added, "Uriah, is there no other option? I heard that the current Umbra Earth is vast, but only those under three hundred years old can be transported there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Each time, the number of people allowed to be teleported is capped at one hundred! The princes and princesses of other royal houses will each form their own teams of one hundred explorers, fifty recruited from the World of Racial Convergence, and fifty elite guards trained by the royal families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must at least provide Alfreda with fifty guards to protect her in Umbra Earth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriah shook his head helplessly. "No way! With the Elven Mother Tree in its dormant phase, all our power is dedicated to maintaining our connection to it. Forget about fifty guards. We couldn't even give her ten!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alfreda's expedition team will have to be recruited solely from the World of Racial Convergence! I suspect that is precisely why Ainsworth proposed his punishment scheme!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hilaria's face filled with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alfreda's entire team must be recruited from the World of Racial Convergence? That won't do! Without enough guards to protect her, who knows if those warriors from the World of Racial Convergence can be trusted? If they actually discover a treasure, Alfreda might not be able to control them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They might even turn on her..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriah closed his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At most, I can spare five young guards to keep Alfreda safe in Umbra Earth, but their levels are low. I can only provide her with one Ascension Five guard and four Ascension Four guards!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's far too few..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Father! Mother!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At last, Alfreda interrupted them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Father, Mother, please stop worrying about me! I know the situation in the Nature Kingdom. It hurts me deeply that I can't do more to help you, and I don't want you to worry about my troubles. You need not spare any guards for my protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't need them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will form my expedition team on my own. I'm not a child anymore. Just trust me this once. I promise I will return safely from Umbra Earth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't need a single guard from you! I can take care of myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriah and Hilaria frowned, but seeing Alfreda's determined expression, they found themselves at a loss for further words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Uriah patted Alfreda on the shoulder forcefully and said, "Alfreda, you have truly grown up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very well! This time, I trust you. Your expedition team will be entirely self-recruited. Remember, once you arrive in Umbra Earth, the dangers from within may be even deadlier than those from Umbra Earth itself! Your team need not be the strongest, but they must be trustworthy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda nodded vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Father, rest assured. I won't be any less than the best! When I return from Umbra Earth, I will not only come back safely but will have accomplished far more than anyone else!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will show everyone that we Nature Elves are no less than any other Elf!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriah smiled at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at Sherwood and sighed, "Oh if only you were a boy! Then I could comfortably pass on the throne to you. But alas, you are a girl..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could continue, Queen Hilaria interrupted sharply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uriah, what nonsense are you spouting? Alfreda is indeed exceptional, but Sherwood isn't bad either. He's just a bit indecisive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sherwood was touched by his mother's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He began, "Mother, you need not explain! I know my nature isn't suited for the role of King of Nature Elf. I believe Alfreda is the better candidate! When Alfreda returns from Umbra Earth, I'll..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, dear!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda suddenly cut him off, "Sherwood, stop right there. Do not try to offload the burden on me! The next Nature Elf King must be you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alfreda turned and dashed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm off now! In two days, I leave for Umbra Earth. As it stands, my expedition team </span><span>doesn</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>t </span><span>ha</span><span>ve</span><span> a single member. I must hurry and recruit them..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And with that, Alfreda disappeared swiftly.</span></p><div class="pagination">
