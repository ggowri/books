  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan was furious at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even now, you're still holding on to that hope? You still think Osborne will come? Get real! Alexander is the one who's right for you! Alexander is better than Osborne in every possible way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You saw what just happened, didn't you? The Augustine family is nothing compared to the Paltrow family. Even when they were humiliated, they had to just suck it up and take it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa remained calm as if she hadn't heard a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan wanted to speak again, but Eugen interrupted him, "Enough. The wedding's already started. There's no point arguing about it now. Clarissa, you're my granddaughter, and I'd never do anything to hurt you. I hope you'll make the right choice and not bring harm to yourself or the whole Radcliffe family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa glanced at Eugen and gave a faint smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She still remained silent but slowly walked towards Alexander, finally standing in the center of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wedding began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A priest holding a Bible appeared, and after a series of rituals, he smiled at Alexander and Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, everyone fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The priest finally spoke, turning to Alexander first. "Alexander, do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife? Do you promise to love, honor, and cherish her, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death do you part?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the priest finished speaking, Alexander smiled faintly, "I do!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The priest nodded and then turned to Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, all eyes were on her, waiting for her to speak the vows that would make her Alexander's wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every single person in the room was watching her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Clarissa's eyes scanned the crowd as if searching for something&mdash;or someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she was disappointed. The person she was looking for wasn't there. She clenched her fists tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the priest spoke again. "Bride, do you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband? Do you promise to live with him, to be his partner in life, to love, honor, and cherish him, in sickness and in health, for richer or for poorer, for better or for worse, until death do you part?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Clarissa couldn't help but smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked over at Alexander, who immediately put on a gentle smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Clarissa spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a calm but unwavering voice, she declared, "I don't!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused before adding firmly, "I don't want to marry him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of murmurs swept through the wedding hall, every head turning towards her in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The smile on Alexander's face froze instantly. His expression turned cold as he immediately looked over at Dylan and Eugen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is going on?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan and Eugen's faces were equally grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Paltrow, we'll take care of this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them immediately walked over to Clarissa, pulling her behind the wall, and quietly demanded, "Clarissa, what's going on with you? You were cooperating a moment ago, why are you backing out now? How are the Paltrows supposed to explain this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa smiled, "Cooperating? When did I ever cooperate with you? I've always made it clear. I will not marry Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan was stunned. "Then why did you come here? You didn't even put up a fight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's smile softened. "Because he said he'd come here to take me away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You!" Dylan was suddenly at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the wedding host was still trying to smooth things over, speaking up. "Everyone, please stay calm. This is just a planned part of the event, a little joke from the bride. The wedding will resume shortly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan glanced at Alexander, whose face was icy and severe, and couldn't help but grit his teeth. "Clarissa, I'm sorry! "We've come too far to turn back now. Even if I have to drag you kicking and screaming, you and Alexander are getting married today! Don't blame me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Dylan reached out to grab Clarissa's shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to control her, determined to make sure the wedding went through no matter what. Otherwise, the Paltrows would never let them off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan, the head of the Radcliffe family and a Class A- metahuman with earth elemental abilities, quickly used his abilities to bind Clarissa's hands and feet. It was as if she were in shackles, completely immobilized and unable to even speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After doing this, Dylan sighed in relief and spoke softly. "Clarissa, don't hold this against me. It's your fate! Once the ceremony is over, I'll let you go. Now, let's get this wedding done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, he reached out to grab Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Clarissa couldn't help but smile. Her smile was beautiful, but it was tinged with deep disappointment. "Dad, I've already told you, I won't marry Alexander! If you keep pushing me, then I'll have no choice... I'll have to fight back! Today, either Osborne takes me away, or... I die right here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Clarissa suddenly moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A pair of enormous Divine and Demonic Wings suddenly burst forth from her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Dylan was about to grab Clarissa, the earth elemental forces that had been holding her body suddenly shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa stepped back, easily dodging Dylan's grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan was stunned. He stared at Clarissa in disbelief, completely shocked by what he was seeing.</span></p><div class="pagination">
