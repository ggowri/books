  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought as she ran, "With my current power, halting time for three minutes is the best I can do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Within those three minutes, I must get Osborne out of here. That should be enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia moved with incredible speed. The entire base of </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> was immobilized, its inhabitants frozen like statues, their time arrested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their thoughts, too, were suspended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only an attack triggering a reflex or a power vastly exceeding Ophelia's could break the temporal halt. Or they would never break the halt or even realize it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Ophelia could move freely, slowing the flow of time around her to accelerate her own speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her speed was 100 yards per second, but the slowed time doubled her speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This ability to manipulate time flow, sounding easier than time freezing but actually more challenging, was a skill she mastered only after breaking into the Class AAA tier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time freezing, in contrast, was the easiest for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slowing time by half was already her limit, a secret even Gerardo didn&rsquo;t know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia actually had six minutes for rescue, though even that was a tight squeeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Faster! I need to go faster!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia pushed her limits, swiftly reaching the Human Slave cultivation room, where everyone stood still, unaware of her approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, she found Osborne in a massive cultivation tank. Her gaze icy as she assessed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>" 93% enslavement? Good, I'm just in time. If it weren't for me, you'd be Gerardo's slave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting more words, she opened the tank, lifting Osborne out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly took him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tall figure materialized in the void after she left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Isa, whose face showed shock and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "It was her all along?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I should have known that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expressions fluctuated, torn and hesitant, her eyebrows knit tight before she sighed, "Perhaps, it's fate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's face regained its usual calm as she said, "It's surprising, Ophelia, that you'd save Osborne. It's quite risky for you now. Why are you doing this, for love or hate?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But why the rush? His enslavement was only at 93%. Wait until 99%; you're wasting the remaining energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a good opportunity for him to improve."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dismissing her thoughts, Isa reached out, causing the tank's pale red solution to boil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining 25% of its energy was extracted by Isa, turning the liquid transparent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at the hundreds of other tanks. "Well, you've saved Osborne and spared me the trouble of showing up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Let me do you a favor in return. Such enslaving methods are too wicked to exist."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a surge of energy, Isa shattered all hundreds of cultivation tanks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa waved her hand, and all the people in the shattered tanks vanished without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, Isa herself disappeared as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dozen or so doctors in white coats and the Human Slave guards guarded at the entrance remained frozen in place, so was the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Ophelia raced toward the exit, dragging Osborne along with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Getting him out of the cultivation tank was just the first step; she needed to get him to a safe place, far from Gerardo's reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Gerardo discovered Osborne was missing, he would undoubtedly hunt Osborne down, and that would lead to Osborne being captured again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on! Come on!" Ophelia urged, pushing her speed to the limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just two minutes, she burst out of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' base and arrived a cave half a mile away, shoving Osborne inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! This is how far I can help you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This cave is well hidden; they shouldn't find you here. You better not let Gerardo catch you again because I'll be coming for you soon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will let you know that I, Ophelia, am more than worthy of you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's you who is not good enough for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia fixed her gaze on Osborne for a moment and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had to get back quickly; there was no room for error. Gerardo could never find out what she had done.</span></p><div class="pagination">
