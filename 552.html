  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne paused, finding a place to sit as he quickly thought through his next steps.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The first battle had ended in success, eliminating four competitors, yet Osborne felt no satisfaction. Those four were never truly in contention for the Heir's Emblems.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His real adversaries were Sam, David, and Rodney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All three were ranked Class AA.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If power levels alone were considered, each of them surpassed Osborne, making them formidable opponents. What made the situation even more precarious was the number of allies they had at their disposal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Branch Bloodline Competition only lasts six hours. As long as I can avoid getting surrounded by them within that time frame, I have a significant chance of emerging as the final victor," Osborne mused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But only if they can't counter my spatial power!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His spatial power allowed him to easily evade his opponents, but if his spatial power was restrained by them and he was caught in an ambush, his chances of survival would be slim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He frowned at the thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Would his spatial power be restrained?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was unsure. And he couldn't put all his hopes on spatial powers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I need to take the initiative. If I can eliminate all my competitors, I'll be safe."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sam, David, Rodney..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne murmured their names as he strategized on how best to eliminate them despite the heavy protection they enjoyed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Buzz!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Osborne's the Heir's Emblem vibrated slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fifteen minutes had passed, and the emblem automatically sent out a signal, revealing his location once again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne stood up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instead of leaving immediately, he glanced at the drone overhead, a look of hesitation crossing his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His spatial power allowed him to easily shake off his enemies, yet the drone always managed to catch up to him quickly&mdash;it was unsettling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Could it be that these drones can constantly track the emblem's position?" Osborne wondered aloud.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He hesitated for a moment before deciding whether to activate his Satan's Eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Until now, he had never revealed this ability in front of the Augustine family. He wasn't sure if exposing it would bring trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Osborne soon dismissed his concerns.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was already a part of the family's branch bloodline. Possessing the Satan's Eye shouldn't be unusual, and no one would likely take issue with it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that thought, Osborne activated his Satan's Eye, directing his gaze into the distance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With his spatial power, he could escape at any moment, but now, he wanted to use the enhanced vision of his Satan's Eye to assess the situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His Satan's Eye was a mutation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While other members of the Augustine family saw white starlight in their eyes when using the ability, Osborne's eyes initially glowed silver, and recently, they had begun to shimmer with a faint golden hue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The power of his Satan's Eye far surpassed the ordinary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Through the dense forest, Osborne's vision extended far, and he quickly spotted Rodney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His expression grew serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Rodney has so many allies? He's even formed alliances with four other branch bloodlines. This could be troublesome!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I originally thought he would be the easiest to deal with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now, he has nearly sixty people on his side. If they surround me, escape might be impossible," Osborne muttered to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He watched as Rodney, brimming with confidence, led nearly sixty men swiftly toward his location.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Too many people. I'll avoid engaging him for now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He made his decision and then shifted his gaze to another direction, where he saw Sam.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam was accompanied by thirty-nine people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thirty-nine?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne noticed one person missing&mdash;David.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"David's not there? Odd. Why would he separate from Sam? And Sam, despite knowing my location, hasn't brought anyone to chase me down?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It seems like he's waiting for something... Could he be waiting for news from David?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne raised an eyebrow, considering the possibility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes quickly scanned the surroundings. He suspected David might have a way to track him without relying on the emblem and was currently on his trail, possibly already nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But after a thorough sweep with his Satan's Eye, Osborne still couldn't locate David.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Strange, could I have been wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne muttered, but just as he was thinking this, his expression changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A sudden, intense sense of danger erupted from behind him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"An assassination!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without thinking, Osborne spun around, throwing a punch behind him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But it hit nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Behind him, there was nothing but empty air. Osborne stumbled forward a few steps, momentarily off balance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His face darkened as the sense of danger not only persisted but intensified. He immediately unleashed his martial art aura, shielding his vital areas.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, a pitch-black dagger appeared out of nowhere, its blade resting against Osborne's neck before slicing across it with brutal precision.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Swish!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sharp blade easily cut through Osborne's martial art aura as if it were mere paper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, the dagger slashed across his throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Blood sprayed out in a violent arc.</p><div class="pagination">
