  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes immediately lit up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though Thorned Veil is a local force, it will take time to find clues in Vice City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During this time, Osborne can only wait.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Adriana has sent all the Fairy Moon Sect's information about the Cosmic Translocator across the Stellar Region, giving Osborne something to do at last.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During this time waiting for intelligence, he can study the Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though learning to build the Cosmic Translocator won't enhance Osborne's strength, it's still better to know than not. If he needs long-distance teleportation in the future, he won't have to rely on interdimensional travel every time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Using interdimensional travel is not only tiring but also slow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Osborne received all the information.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll take a break. If there's any news from Thorned Veil, notify me immediately," Osborne said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela knew Osborne was going into seclusion to comprehend, nodded, and said, "Don't worry, I'll keep an eye on it for you. Also, don't rush too much. Building the Cosmic Translocator is a very complex process, and the principles are hard to grasp&mdash;it can't be mastered in a short time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He entered the room and immediately used time powers to accelerate time by a hundredfold.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne quickly began studying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela wasn't lying to Osborne. Learning the Cosmic Translocator was indeed extremely complex, with too much to grasp and comprehend. It was no easier than cultivation and improvement&mdash;perhaps even harder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The vast amount of information took Osborne half a month just to skim through quickly. By the time he finished, he already felt a bit dizzy and lightheaded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He realized he had underestimated the difficulty of building the Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Building the Cosmic Translocator was on a completely different level of difficulty compared to repairing it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He muttered to himself, "So building the Cosmic Translocator is this difficult. No wonder on the Racial Convergence Planet, people capable of building the Cosmic Translocator on their own are extremely rare. Even the Fairy Moon Sect can't find someone who can independently construct one. I&rsquo;ll need a lot of people working together to finally succeed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, the Fairy Moon Sect can only build interplanetary Cosmic Translocators.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And Cosmic Translocators are also divided into levels."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Level-1 interstellar translocators can only transport within a planet, from one city to another. The farthest distance doesn't exceed one light-year."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Level-2 Cosmic Translocators can transport from one planet to another, with a maximum range of no more than 100 light-years."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And Level-3 Cosmic Translocators, also known as Stellar Region translocators, can transport across Stellar Regions, from one Stellar Region to another. The maximum range doesn't exceed 10,000 light-years."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And the strongest Cosmic Translocator on the Racial Convergence Planet is Level-4."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Level-4 Cosmic Translocators can instantly traverse multiple Stellar Regions and even cross galaxies, with a maximum range of one million light-years."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course, there are even more powerful Cosmic Translocators, but they don't exist on the Racial Convergence Planet. Moreover, activating a Level-4 Cosmic Translocator consumes an enormous amount of energy, making higher-level ones unaffordable for most people."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne silently studied and pondered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Racial Convergence Stellar Region is considered one of the larger Stellar Regions nearby, with a diameter of about 30,000 light-years. The surrounding dozen or so Stellar Regions together form a galaxy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A galaxy's diameter is at least 100,000 light-years, sometimes even reaching a million light-years. This distance is incredibly vast. Without a Cosmic Translocator, relying solely on speed to traverse the void would be impossible, even if Ms. Alba exhausted her entire lifespan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But whether it's a Stellar Region or an even larger galaxy, they all seem incredibly insignificant compared to the vast universe. Like a grain of sand in the desert, a drop of water in the ocean."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a bitter smile. "Every being who looks up at the starry sky feels their own insignificance. However, as long as they continue to evolve and grow stronger, the vast universe will seem less immense, and they might even become the Master of the cosmos."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, that's too far away for me. For now, I need to first learn how to build a Level-1 Cosmic Translocator."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After thinking, Osborne began to study and comprehend seriously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He underestimated the complexity of the Cosmic Translocator, but his learning and comprehension speed far surpassed Angela's. Angela took three years to learn how to repair the Cosmic Translocator, while Osborne only took one day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, his skill level had already surpassed Angela's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although learning to build the Cosmic Translocator was difficult, no matter how hard it was, there would always be a time to master it. Osborne was completely immersed, feeling his progress every day, and his understanding of the Cosmic Translocator improved daily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Time passed quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the hundredfold time acceleration, a year quickly passed, while only three days went by in the outside world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That day, Osborne suddenly felt all his pores open up, an intense sense of joy filled his heart, and some black impurities emerged from his pores.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was instantly overjoyed. "I've finally broken through to the advanced Sacredness Level!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's Satan's Eye constantly helped him break down and absorb the Magma Devourer's Marrow Crystal. At this point, with only about a third absorbed, Osborne's body had already transformed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Reaching the advanced Sacredness Level made his body tougher, his strength surged, and Osborne's Sacred Power became even stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It's a pity that the Human Community's body is inherently lacking. Even though I've reached the advanced Sacredness Level, it's still not strong enough. Compared to Flash and Magma Devourer, I'm still far behind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, compared to the average Beast Clan, </span><span>his</span><span> body </span><span>wa</span><span>s definitely not bad. Among those at the same cultivation level as me, few ha</span><span>d</span><span> a body stronger than </span><span>his</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At </span><span>this, Osborne felt very satisfied.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't stay happy for long and immediately returned to studying and comprehending. He felt that he was now not far from independently constructing a first-level Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps it won't take long before he succeeds.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, before that, Osborne encountered something that could further enhance his strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the full nurturing of the Warfare Ancient Tree, the Bloodwrought Bow finally leveled up, evolving from an Inferior Sacred Artifact to a Mid-grade Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although it is just a Mid-grade Sacred Artifact, in Osborne's hands, the Bloodwrought Bow can unleash power surpassing any Superior Sacred Artifact. Now, if Osborne wants to kill an ordinary mid Empyrean Sacredness warrior, he might no longer need to use the Earth Arrow; the Human Arrow would already suffice.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Osborne felt that the Warfare Scythe and Warfare Shield were also rapidly improving, not far from evolving into Superior Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By the time the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel begins, the Warfare Scythe and Warfare Shield will definitely evolve into Superior Sacred Artifacts!" Osborne was very pleased.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after, Osborne encountered another good thing. After nearly two years of study, he finally fully mastered the construction of a Level 1 Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><div class="pagination">
