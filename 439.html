  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but tremble and roar in pain, but all the sounds were confined in the room and could not be heard outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa had once said that compressing his soul of powers not only required immense strength but also demanded an extremely delicate touch, like using a large excavator to peel a raw egg without breaking the membrane inside or spilling the egg white.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Osborne felt as if Isa wasn't peeling an eggshell but smashing a rock. Her actions were swift, powerful, and without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a testament to Isa's immense power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne realized that Isa's control over her strength had reached an unimaginable level. Things that others could not accomplish no matter how careful they were, Isa could do with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the source of Isa's confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long while, Osborne endured the wave of pain. The worry on Isa's face eased significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will continue to compress your soul of powers like this a few more times until I can no longer compress it. Hang in there a little longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Bring it on. I can take it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a loud crash, Osborne's soul of powers was compressed once more, shrinking from around 1.5 yards to less than one yard. The intense pain hit him again, and he gritted his teeth, enduring it with sheer willpower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, the compression continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's strength seemed boundless. Osborne felt his soul of powers had been compressed to the limit, ready to collapse at any moment, yet Isa could still continue the compression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She compressed it over and over again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lingering pain seemed endless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time passed slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Days went by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seven days later, Osborne's soul of powers had finally been compressed to its absolute limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, his soul of powers had transformed, taking the shape of an eye!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had become a single eye radiating a deep golden light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After compressing it into an eye, Isa tried several more times but found she could no longer compress it further, and finally, she stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Isa looked exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, compressing Osborne's soul of powers to this extent had been a huge drain on her. It was the first time Osborne saw Isa so exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart swelled with both gratitude and concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, are you alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa bit her lip and shook her head. "Don't worry, I'm fine. Your soul of powers has been compressed to the extreme. I didn't expect it to turn into an eye. How strange."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a mix of puzzlement and concern on Isa's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't that a good thing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa shook her head. "I'm not sure. Who can tell? But given that you possess the Satan's Eye, this seems more like a good thing. After all, your powers stem from the Satan's Eye, so it's natural that your soul of powers would ultimately compress into an eye."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, finding her explanation reasonable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, what do we do next?" asked Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, you're on your own! You need to let it fully merge with your body and complete the transformation within your body. If you succeed, you'll become a Class A Power Master!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From this point on, I can no longer assist you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be careful! In theory, you should succeed, but I can't guarantee it. No matter what happens, you must survive, do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, a grave and anxious expression appeared on Isa's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her expression, Osborne realized the gravity of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled and said, "Don't worry, Isa, I won't let you down! I haven't even become your man yet, so how could I die?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait for my success. I promised I'd hold you while I sleep, and I will definitely do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa bit her lip tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I'll wait for your success!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, took a deep breath, and guided the soul of powers that had been compressed to the extreme into his body. Now, his soul of powers looked like it might shatter at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deafening crash, a terrifying power erupted within Osborne. His body began to tremble violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He closed his eyes tightly, his expression resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa watched Osborne nervously, her fists clenching, her face full of worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she couldn't help him now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Osborne had to rely on himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, at the Radcliffe Manor, Donna looked at Clarissa and sighed. "Clarissa, the people from the Paltrow family has sent over the wedding dress. Do you want to try it on? If the size is wrong, we can still alter it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's face was grim as she replied indifferently, "I don't want to try it on. Throw it away. I won't marry Alexander. Even if you force me to the wedding, he'll come to take me away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's father, Dylan, snorted coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, you're still thinking about Osborne? Do you really think he will come to the wedding to pick you up? How ridiculous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He wouldn't dare set foot in the Paltrow Estate. He's been missing for half a month. He's definitely hiding from you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give it up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are going to marry Alexander. He is the best candidate to be your husband!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
