  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Alfreda let out another sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only we in the Nature Elf Clan find ourselves in such an awkward position in Elf City! We're the least numerous, and there are hardly any top-tier warriors above Ascension Eight among us. We lack any special abilities that could help other elves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because of that, the Nature Elf Clan ranks lowest among the nine clans in Elf City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, if that were all there was to it, it wouldn't be the end of the world!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elf City has become quite strange lately. Under various restrictions, any outsider race finds their status even lower than that of the Nature Elf Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"While we might not have any special standing, at least we're better off than you humans. Life here is much easier for us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, understanding her point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the Nature Elf Clan was at the bottom of the hierarchy among the nine clans, they were still elves, which inherently gave them a higher status than the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it left him wondering why Alfreda's inn was empty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustration crept into Alfreda's voice as she continued, "Elf City has changed! They've forgotten that the very ancestor who created Elf City were from the Nature Elf Clan! If that ancestor were still around, no one would dare to bully us. They'd be falling all over themselves to curry our favor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now... just because I crossed paths with Princess Monica of the Fire Elf Clan, they're all ganging up on me! They've threatened that unless I apologize, I won't be able to survive in Elf City, and they're saying they'll shut down my Emerald Forest Lodge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's infuriating! It was her fault to begin with!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's the princess of the Fire Elf Clan, and I'm a princess of the Nature Elf Clan! Just because I accidentally bumped into her while walking, she wants to whip me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I stood up for myself, and she went crying to her elders in the Fire Elf Clan! As a result, I got punished by my father. He said I either had to apologize to Monica and win her forgiveness or stay here and run this inn until I earn ten Sacred Crystals to return home!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could I possibly earn ten Sacred Crystals running this tiny, remote inn? I'd be lucky to make even one!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But there's no way I'm apologizing to Monica!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'd rather never go back than bow down to her! If I have to guard this inn forever, so be it! At least it means I can take it easy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because of Monica, no one dares to rent my cabins, all afraid of offending her! It's left me with no resources for training. If this keeps up, I might not even survive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Alfreda's face flushed with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That despicable Monica! She's just jealous of how cute I am! She's envious of my strength! Resorting to such dirty tricks! I'd rather starve here than give in to her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, her fury was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at her in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "She's a member of the Nature Elf Clan's Royal Family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The daughter of the clan leader... a princess?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she's being punished here for crossing the Fire Elf Clan's princess, Monica? No wonder no one wants to rent from her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is outrageous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He studied Alfreda closely, realizing that she didn't carry herself like a typical elven princess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then again, the Nature Elf Clan was rare, and the so-called Royal Family was likely weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made sense that Alfreda, as a princess, might be quite ordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda said, her voice trembling slightly, "Osborne, I don't want to mislead you. If you rent a cabin from me, there's a real chance you'll offend Monica and earn her wrath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if I'm barely hanging on, even if I'm starving, even if... but if your decision is to go, I won't try to stop you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, her eyes glistened with unshed tears, and the sight was so pitiful that Osborne couldn't help but chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood up, and Alfreda's expression shifted to one of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like you're really leaving! Well, I might as well just starve here!" she sighed dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rolled his eyes. "Come on, cut the act! I'm not going anywhere! If you were dealing with any other elf princess, I'd be out the door in a heartbeat. I don't want trouble!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter how much you try to play the victim, I wouldn't stick around! I could leave you a few Celestial Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But since it's the Fire Elf Clan's princess you've crossed, that changes everything! I've decided to stay and rent a cabin from you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, I don't have any Celestial Crystals on me. Would you take Miracle Elixirs instead? One Miracle Elixir is worth a thousand Celestial Crystals, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda stared at him, stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, did you just say you're not leaving? You want to rent a cabin here? You're not afraid of offending Princess Monica?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face lit up with joy, and she nodded vigorously. "Of course you can use Miracle Elixirs! One is definitely worth a thousand Celestial Crystals! But, um, the best cabin I have only costs a hundred Celestial Crystals for a year. I can't really make up the difference for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked a bit troubled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pulled out two Miracle Elixirs and handed them to her. "Then I'll rent it for ten years! And let's consider the extra elixir as payment for that Elf Water you treated me to. Don't starve on my account!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda took the two Miracle Elixirs, her eyes widening in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those two were worth two thousand Celestial Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was enough for her to train for quite a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart swelled with gratitude, but a hint of embarrassment crept in as she murmured, "I can't accept this! One cup of Elf Water is only worth ten Celestial Crystals. I can't take so much from you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, that was my treat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She reached out to return one of the Miracle Elixirs, though her reluctance was evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and shook his head. "Consider that one a gift from me! You treated me to Elf Water, so it's only fair I return the favor with a Miracle Elixir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda bit her lip, with her eyes starting to glisten with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Osborne! It's been so long since anyone has treated me this well! I really appreciate it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly tucked the Miracle Elixirs away, her heart racing. "From now on, you're my friend! Let me show you to the best cabin..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she wiped her eyes and led the way, a hint of a smile breaking through her earlier despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne followed her, bemused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Is this a performance?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She's really not very good at it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he kept his thoughts to himself as they arrived at the top of the Elf Tree, standing before a beautiful cabin that truly looked like the best in the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, this is your new home! It's the best spot for training and offers the finest view," she said, handing him a key.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She added, "By the way, I'm curious&mdash;why aren't you worried about offending Princess Monica? That's something I really want to know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, "Because... I've already crossed paths with a prince named Desmond. I'm not too concerned about ruffling another princess' feathers."</span></p><div class="pagination">
