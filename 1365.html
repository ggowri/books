  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Using the spatial tide to kill you? Now that's a brilliant idea," the God of Time said, her face breaking into a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression darkened. "You wouldn't dare! If the spatial tide erupts, you won't be able to return to </span><span>Celestara</span><span> either! Even if you once had ways to handle it, you're just a peak Transcendent Deity now. Are you sure you can withstand it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Time let out a cold laugh. "You really have no idea about the methods employed by a top Deity King warrior! You think just because you can match me in divine power and Divine Body, you're my equal?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if my divine power and Divine Body are inferior to yours, I have plenty of tricks up my sleeve to take you down! But I'm not planning to do that, so you won't get the chance to experience it firsthand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for the spatial tide, don't worry; it won't harm me in the slightest, and I'll make it to </span><span>Celestara</span><span> without a hitch! But you? You'll get to feel the full force of the spatial tide! Even if you have spatial power and aren't torn apart by it, you'll be lost in the depths of space forever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, the God of Time struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time Distortion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the already trembling dimensional portal warped dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surrounding time unraveled, and what was once a stable dimensional portal suddenly collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying surge of spatial power erupted, sending Osborne flying as the chaos engulfed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming force of the spatial tide crashed over Osborne like a tidal wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face paled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! You crazy woman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne roared at the God of Time, fury blazing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could she have actually destroyed the dimensional portal and summoned the spatial tide? This is a disaster!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He poured every ounce of his strength into wielding his spatial power, but the surrounding chaos was too wild, too erratic. Even with his Level Six space elemental essence, he couldn't control the tumultuous energy, let alone maintain his balance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vicious spatial force began to tear at his Divine Body, and fine, deep wounds appeared rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Time, too, was caught in the maelstrom of the spatial tide, but somehow, she stood firm, unaffected by the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if she had some hidden method to shield herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Osborne with a mocking smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enjoy the power of the spatial tide, Osborne! Forever lost in the void!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just an ant&mdash;insignificant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't fathom why she's so desperate for your forgiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now, I'm off! Farewell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the God of Time vanished into the raging tide, her form receding into the distance. Osborne caught a fleeting glimpse of her heading straight for </span><span>Celestara</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart raced, and he instinctively tried to follow her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the ferocity of the spatial tide made it impossible for him to even stand his ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, the God of Time disappeared from sight, and even </span><span>Celestara</span><span> was lost to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face grew grave. "No! If this keeps up, the spatial tide will tear my Divine Body apart! Even with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, even with my immortality, I can only rely on it to revive me so many times!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've only completed the fourth stage of fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus, which means my chances of revival are limited! If I can't break free from the spatial tide, I'll be shredded and killed over and over again until I run out of lives, left to be abandoned by the Lotus, doomed to die here forever!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne grew frantic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What can I do? Even with my Level Six space elemental essence, I'm utterly disoriented in this spatial tide. I can't find my way back to Blue Planet, nor can I reach </span><span>Celestara</span><span>. Am I really doomed to die here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne cursed the God of Time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only she had waited until he crossed the dimensional portal and entered </span><span>Celestara</span><span> to strike, he wouldn't have been so fearful. No matter how formidable her arsenal, he was confident he could handle it, at least enough to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least he wouldn't be in such a desperate situation now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying power of the spatial tide swiftly tore at Osborne's Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his Divine Body being stronger than an average Level Eight one, it couldn't withstand the might of the spatial tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he was only a Superior Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scent of death now enveloped Osborne, who could only drift helplessly within the spatial tide, utterly powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "No, I can't die here! I must escape; I absolutely can't perish here or get lost in the depths of space!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My grandfather, my sister, and the Bryce and her sister are all within me. If I die here or get lost in space, they're doomed too. For their sake, I must escape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne endured the excruciating pain of his Divine Body being torn apart by the </span><span>spatial tide, rapidly brainstorming a solution.</span></p><div class="pagination">
