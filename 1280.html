  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ten Superior Deities of the Deschanel Clan erupted in a frenzy of divine power, desperately trying to break free from the petrification that held them captive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They believed that Osborne's petrification was weak, assuming they could easily dispel it and make a quick escape from the collapsing space around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they were dead wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Medusa's Gaze had fully absorbed the core energy of a Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, evolving into something far more powerful. Even the true Goddess Medusa wouldn't have been able to match the intensity of Osborne's petrification.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their frantic efforts, the ten Superior Deities found themselves unable to shake off the stone curse. Their bodies remained frozen, trapped in a state of utter helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic set in among the Deschanel Clan's elite. They shouted in desperation, their voices tinged with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're from the Deschanel Clan! Stop right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a cold laugh, thinking, "And you think I'd be intimidated now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What does it matter that you're from the Deschanel Clan?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've lost count of how many of your warriors I've taken down. When your clan decided to make a play for world domination and target the Augustine family, we became sworn enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There's no turning back now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the peak power of Level Five space elemental essence coursing through him, Osborne executed Space Collapse at lightning speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The area within a thousand yards was rapidly consumed by the cataclysm, the horrific force tearing at the immobile bodies of the ten Superior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Ahhh</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their screams echoed through the air as they helplessly witnessed their Divine Bodies being crushed by the collapsing power, disintegrating into nothingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At last, silence fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All ten Superior Deities from the Deschanel Clan had vanished, leaving not a trace behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were completely obliterated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne had successfully taken down all twelve Superior Deities of the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer scale of his achievement left him momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking down twelve Superior Deities would be an arduous task for even a Transcendent Deity, yet Osborne had accomplished it in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This didn't mean he was stronger than a Transcendent Deity, but it certainly proved that ordinary Superior Deities posed no threat to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliminating them was a walk in the park!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearby, Sebastian, Anastasia, Bryce, and the rest of the Augustine family stood in shock, their eyes wide as they watched Osborne fend off the attacks and swiftly retaliate. In mere moments, he had dispatched twelve Superior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twelve Superior Deities!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They, as a team, couldn't withstand the might of those twelve, while Osborne took them down so effortlessly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe I'm getting too old for this," Sebastian muttered under his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne truly is the best!" Anastasia's eyes sparkled with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought I was closing the gap between us, but now I see it's only widened," Bryce said, shaking his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our patriarch is unbeatable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Augustine family quickly snapped out of their daze, their faces lighting up with excitement as they gazed at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes shone with awe and exhilaration. With Osborne here, they felt invincible. They no longer had to fear for their lives!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the battle wasn't over yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly appeared beside his family. "Grandpa, Anastasia, are you both okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian nodded, relief washing over his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're fine! Osborne, you made it just in time! Hurry and help God of Star and Divine Shadow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded confidently. "Don't worry, Grandpa. Elder God of Star and Grandma Divine Shadow will be just fine. I'll get you all back to the Augustine Bastion first, and then I'll handle the rest!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he opened a dimensional rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandma Divine Shadow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian paused, momentarily taken aback by Osborne's casual reference. "He actually called Divine Shadow 'Grandma'?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian opened his mouth to ask but ultimately decided against it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, the members of the Augustine family stepped through the dimensional rift, and Osborne used his spatial power to transport them safely back to the Augustine Bastion. Many of them were injured and would need time to recuperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he had ensured their safety, Osborne lifted his gaze to the sky, where two other battlefields raged on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Star and Divine Shadow had joined forces against Eamon, Cedric, and his brother Evander Deschanel, three Transcendent Deity warriors from the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, it was clear that the God of Star and Divine Shadow had the upper </span><span>hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their combined strength surpassed that of Eamon and his companions, and even with the odds stacked against them&mdash;two against three&mdash;they were still dominating the fight. However, defeating three Transcendent Deity warriors wouldn't be a walk in the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted softly, feeling a surge of determination. He was ready to jump into the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he had easily dispatched twelve Superior Deities, he wasn't entirely sure what it would be like to face a Transcendent Deity warrior head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne needed to experience that clash for himself to truly understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And right now, this was the perfect opportunity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, Osborne shot into the sky, quickly closing the distance to the battlefield.</span></p><div class="pagination">
