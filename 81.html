  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Many bodyguards were whispering and felt that Osborne was doomed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Kneel down and apologize to me. I can still forgive you,&rdquo; Paul said coldly, &ldquo;Otherwise, I will crush your kneecaps with my own hands, so that you can only kneel for the rest of your life. You will never stand up again.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul looked scary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul was the captain of Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguards. He was a martial artist and extremely powerful. He had killed countless people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ordinary people would probably find it difficult to even stand firm in the face of Paul&rsquo;s fierce momentum.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Osborne remained calm throughout.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He said coldly, &ldquo;My knees are very stiff. I don&rsquo;t know how to kneel. How about you teach me? Or you can just do it quickly. I want to know whether you can break my kneecap, or I can smash your head.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Osborne finished speaking, all the bodyguards exclaimed in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You are so arrogant.&rdquo; Suddenly, a loud shout came from behind Paul. A young man in his twenties stood out from the crowd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Captain Paul, you have a noble status. How can you do it yourself? He doesn&rsquo;t know how to respect you. Let me teach him a lesson.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The young man looked at Paul with a fawning look. But when he looked at Osborne, his expression immediately became fierce and contemptuous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul sneered and nodded. &ldquo;Very good. You teach him a lesson for me. I&rsquo;ll reward you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The young man was overjoyed when he heard this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He looked at Osborne with a sneer and twisted his neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Remember this, my name is Charles. I am the leader of the First Guard Group. If you dare to disrespect Captain Paul, I will teach you a lesson. Kneel down.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After saying that, Charles suddenly took action.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He punched Osborne&rsquo;s head very quickly. He reached Osborne in the blink of an eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Those who could become the bodyguards of the Radcliffe family were not weak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even if a member of the guard team was powerful, Charles was the leader of the guard team.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As soon as he made a move, many people nodded and whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Charles has improved again. His strength is stronger than that of the average bodyguard team member. If he hadn&rsquo;t wanted to be the chief of the security team, he would have joined the bodyguard team long ago.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;He has a lot of combat experience. His best skill is actually kicking. If that boy doesn&rsquo;t pay attention, he&rsquo;ll probably suffer a big loss.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne looked calm at this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He didn&rsquo;t even need to open Satan&rsquo;s Eye to see Charles&rsquo; movements. He found that Charles&rsquo; fist was just a feint. His real strength was stored in his legs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne snorted coldly and stretched out his hand suddenly. He grabbed Charles&rsquo; fist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Charles was not panicked. He said happily, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve fallen into the trap.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Charles&rsquo; right leg moved violently and kicked Osborne&rsquo;s chest hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The distance was so close that he would kick Osborne in the blink of an eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But in the next second, Charles&rsquo; expression changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Because at that moment, Osborne actually twisted his waist slightly. He just avoided Charles&rsquo; attack and then kneed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s knee hit Charles&rsquo; face hard. Charles screamed. Blood spurted out of his eyes and nose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Without waiting for him to move, Osborne kicked Charles&rsquo; knee hard again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Charles&rsquo; kneecap was kicked and shattered. He fell to his knees in front of Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Pain and humiliation came at once. Charles&rsquo; eyes rolled back. He fainted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">All this happened in an instant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It took only one second for Charles to take the initiative and kneel in front of Osborne with blood all over his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne acted as if he had done something insignificant. He smiled faintly, &ldquo;Captain Paul, I can&rsquo;t believe you sent this kind of trash to deal with me. Can you send someone capable?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul pulled a long face. He snorted coldly and said, &ldquo;Jason, go ahead. Don&rsquo;t hold back. Teach him a lesson.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As soon as he finished speaking, another bodyguard stepped out from the crowd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Judging from Jason&rsquo;s clothes, he was an elite member of the bodyguard team. He was stronger than Charles. He didn&rsquo;t say a word and pounced like a cheetah.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne kicked him out. Jason fell heavily to the ground and was unable to stand up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The bodyguards exclaimed again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Even Jason is no match for him. Can he be compared with those of the Personal Guards?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Will the Personal Guards take action?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As everyone was talking, Paul waved his hand again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You do have something. What a shame. Do you think you can fight me like this? Leo, I will give you ten more bodyguards. I only have one request. Destroy him for me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Paul finished speaking coldly, a middle-aged man walked out with ten elite bodyguards.</p><div class="pagination">
