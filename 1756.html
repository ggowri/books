  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, a voice like thunder reverberated through Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An ant dares to gaze upon the Creator Deity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ant, I will remember you. Should you ever ascend the divine steps, I will take your life! Now, begone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deafening roar echoed in Osborne's head, causing blood to stream from his eyes, nose, mouth, and ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a piercing scream, the agony overwhelming him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what felt like an eternity, Osborne finally managed to pull himself together, gasping for breath, terror, and confusion etched in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt his body shudder violently, his eyes wide with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What in the world was that?! I merely exchanged glances, and I'm left with these grievous injuries? My divine power essence, elemental essence&mdash;they're nearly shattered, and my Divine Body is cracking! Even my Soul Current Ocean is on the verge of collapse..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face darkened with gravity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The injuries he sustained were far worse than when he first arrived in Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity remained unaffected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With its aid, his wounds began to heal rapidly, the Soul Current Ocean and Divine Body mending, while his divine power essence and elemental essence slowly restored themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it weren't for the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, I'd be done for! What was that colossal humanoid statue? Why was it so terrifying?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An ant dares to gaze upon the Creator Deity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that he is the Creator Deity? An existence beyond the Deity King realm?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What did he mean by ascending the divine steps?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said he'd remember me and that he'd come for me if I ever ascended..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression was grave as he replayed the images in his mind&mdash;the countless roots entwining the massive Celestial Sword Peak at the center of Divine Peak Nine, and the ominous humanoid statue looming over it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That statue must be the Shadow Terror Fiend I encountered! He calls himself the Creator Deity&mdash;could he truly be a god of creation? Stronger than Lord Malevolence or the God of Night?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that's the case, everything makes sense!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence and the God of Night were both severely wounded by the Shadow Terror Fiend atop the divine peak!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And those roots... they resemble the root creatures I encountered in the deep space!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Were they fighting the Shadow Terror Fiend, or was there something else at play?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If those root beings can ensnare the Shadow Terror Fiend, could they also be of Creator Deity caliber?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head, frustration gnawing at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He yearned for another glimpse to uncover the connection between the root beings and the Shadow Terror Fiend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne ultimately forced himself to suppress the impulse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Biting his lip, he thought, "Just a single glance, and I'm gravely injured! If I continue to pry, I might provoke the Shadow Terror Fiend and end up dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he kills me, I can't even be sure the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity could bring me back! I can't take that risk!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My understanding of this world is still too limited! Divine peak undoubtedly conceals great secrets&mdash;perhaps the greatest secrets of this world! But I need to reach the level of the God of Night or Lord Malevolence to explore the core secrets of the divine peak!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, both Lord Malevolence and the God of Night survived the Shadow Terror Fiend's pursuit. If I can reach their level of power, the Shadow Terror Fiend won't easily erase me, and then I could delve into the core mysteries of </span><span>d</span><span>ivine </span><span>p</span><span>eak!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deep breath, Osborne steadied himself, pushing aside the haunting memories he had just encountered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He buried those images deep in his mind and redirected his focus to exploring the changes that had come with his breakthrough to Level Ten of Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enhancement of his vision was merely the tip of the iceberg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he didn't even need to consciously activate Satan's Eye to perceive the subtleties of his surroundings; it was as if a veil had lifted, revealing the world in sharper detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the most significant transformation lay in his Infinite Devouring Eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon reaching Level Ten, Satan's Eye had altered the nature of the Infinite Devouring Eyes entirely. Previously, they had merely been a shadowy presence, capable of consuming ambient energy to aid Osborne in his ascension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they had grown larger and more intricate, hovering above him like a colossal magical eye. The veins pulsing on its surface were vividly clear, a testament to its newfound power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What struck Osborne most was the dramatic increase in its absorption capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No longer limited to merely devouring stray energy, the Infinite Devouring Eyes could now consume any material substance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For instance, Essence Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the Infinite Devouring Eyes could directly devour Essence Crystals, swiftly converting their energy into the divine power he desperately needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed of this process was staggering compared to before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In mere moments, the Infinite Devouring Eyes could consume a Celestial Crystal, draining its immense energy and using it to elevate Osborne's power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The efficiency was astounding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, to break through the Deity King realm, Osborne needed vast amounts of energy. In Hope Haven, his Infinite Devouring Eyes would take a month to gather enough power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with the ability to consume Celestial Crystals, he could achieve that in just half a day!</span></p><div class="pagination">
