  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!" Osborne shouted as he struck down the first Superior Deity of the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's pause, he vanished into the parallel dimension, completely disappearing from sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, he reappeared behind the second Superior Deity of the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This deity had just witnessed Osborne block their attacks and, in a flash of speed, eliminate one of his comrades. He was already terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's sudden disappearance had sent shivers down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frantically searched for Osborne, but little did he know that Osborne was already right behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch out!" one of his allies shouted in alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deity was bewildered, unsure of what to be cautious about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only when Osborne struck from behind, his fist crackling with divine power, that he finally sensed the danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming force exploded against the back of his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't even have time to scream; his skull shattered like a watermelon smashed against the ground, and his body crumpled to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deity was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Osborne had taken out two Superior Deities from the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining ten Superior Deities wore expressions of fury mixed with a tinge of fear. They quickly regrouped, realizing that Osborne's displayed power was too formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They figured that by standing together, they might have a fighting chance. At the very least, Osborne wouldn't be able to pick them off one by one so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, if they were united, they thought it would be a challenge for a Transcendent Deity to take them down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, upon seeing them huddle together, Osborne didn't attack again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hovered in the air, his icy gaze locked onto the ten of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the Superior Deities barked, "Who the hell are you? Killing members of the Deschanel Clan? You're asking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked coldly. "You come looking for trouble with the Augustine family, and you don't even know who I am? Well, listen up! I'm Osborne, the current head of the Augustine family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? You're Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can you be this strong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining Superior Deities gasped in disbelief. According to their intel, Osborne </span><span>was just a young upstart, nothing to worry about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here he was, dispatching two of their own with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring their shock, Osborne narrowed his eyes. "You think huddling together will save you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really believe I can't do anything to you now? Pathetic! Abyssal Spiral!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne unleashed his next attack, dark energy swirling violently in front of him. In an instant, it expanded to cover a radius of over a thousand yards, forming a monstrous vortex that radiated a terrifying, consuming power, threatening to engulf the ten Superior Deities of the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deities felt the force of the Abyssal Spiral, and their expressions hardened dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's strike together! We have to shatter his attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ten deities didn't sit idle, waiting for the Abyssal Spiral to consume them. They unleashed their own attacks, bombarding the ever-growing vortex in a desperate attempt to destroy it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, the Abyssal Spiral began to collapse under their relentless assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but furrow his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems the Abyssal Spiral isn't quite suited for this situation! But that's alright; this is just the beginning..." he murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Temporal Stasis!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a blinding light erupting from his left eye, Osborne unleashed the new ability of Satan's Eye, which was activated after breaking through Level Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, the expressions of the ten Superior Deities from the Deschanel Clan froze in shock. Time around them had come to a standstill, ensnared by the grip of Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their bodies and souls were trapped in a temporal prison, immobilized in a moment that felt like an eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this was just the beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, merely freezing time wouldn't inflict any damage. Osborne had something far more lethal in mind&mdash;while they were helpless, he would unleash his full might to eliminate them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Petrify!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's right eye glowed with the brilliant light of Medusa's Gaze. Drawing upon the core energy of a Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, Medusa's Gaze demonstrated its true power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The radiant beam enveloped the bodies of the ten Superior Deities, instantly turning them into lifeless statues frozen in place as if carved from stone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, this was still not the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Space Collapse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne unleashed his ultimate attack, manipulating spatial energy to cause the entire realm surrounding the ten Superior Deities to implode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was at that moment that the Deschanel Clan's ten Superior Deities finally sensed the impending doom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time resumed, their faces twisted in terror. They could feel the very fabric of space around them collapsing in on itself, and panic surged through them as they desperately tried to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But their horror deepened when they realized that their bodies remained petrified, unable to move an inch!</span></p><div class="pagination">
