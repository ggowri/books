  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The higher the realm, the easier it is to fall into hallucinations? Those with strong soul power can resist these illusions better?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but raise an eyebrow, a smile creeping onto his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In truth, his own realm was only at the early stage of Transcendent Deity, making him the weakest among the residents of Divine Peak Nine. Here, even the lowest-ranked beings were at least at the early Transcendent Deity level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for his soul power, Osborne believed it was formidable enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was confident that he could hold his own against warriors at the early to </span><span>mid Deity</span><span> Overlord stages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, with a lower realm and stronger soul power, wasn't he the ideal candidate for training here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chances of him experiencing hallucinations would be minimal, and his resistance to them would be at its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought made him chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For others, training in this place was a double-edged sword, fraught with risks and rewards. But for him? It seemed like a golden opportunity&mdash;perhaps only benefits and no risks at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well then, I won't waste any more time! Tomorrow morning, Athena will assign me a task. She'll likely give me the most dangerous one she can manage within her authority. I need to boost my lightning elemental essence to the mid-Level Six as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That way, even if I rely solely on Thunder Power, I can stand toe-to-toe with an average mid-stage Deity Overlord warrior! And if Athena herself comes at me, I won't be afraid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne slipped into a meditative state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sensation of heightened comprehension was intoxicating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he began to train, he quickly sank into a deep state of focus. In such a trance, if hallucinations were to occur, they would likely be brushed aside without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time he snapped back to reality, he might already be under their influence, his mind in disarray, and his soul power restless, making it difficult to break free from the </span><span>illusions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne reassured himself. Given his low realm and strong soul power, training this far from Divine Peak Nine should keep hallucinations at bay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could be affected, then others would have no hope at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, he remained cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, everything unfolded just as he had anticipated. Throughout the night, he experienced no hallucinations. Thanks to a threefold boost in comprehension, he successfully elevated his lightning elemental essence to mid-Level Six before dawn broke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally, mid-Level Six!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lightning crackled around him, filling the air with a symphony of pops and snaps. "This mid-Level Six lightning elemental essence should suffice for now! Next, I need to focus on enhancing my space elemental essence and dark elemental essence. Plus, I can't afford to neglect my realm's elevation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, a sudden idea sparked in Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Infinite Devouring Eyes are currently deep within the No. 9 mining area, where the energy density is substantial. With this, the Infinite Devouring Eyes can rapidly absorb energy, helping me elevate my realm. Right now, my rate of advancement surpasses that of those talented individuals who have access to ample top-grade Essence Crystals for their training&mdash;by nearly a hundred times!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But around Divine Peak Nine, the energy density is at least several times greater than that in the depths of the No. 9 mining area! The closer I get to Divine Peak Nine, the more intense the energy becomes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I position my Infinite Devouring Eyes at Divine Peak Nine, even just at its outskirts, the speed of energy absorption will increase tenfold! My rate of advancement would also soar by ten times!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This means I could progress a thousand times faster than those using top-grade Essence Crystal for their cultivation! While those folks might take three years to climb a small realm, I'd only need a day!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, that's in a perfect scenario; realistically, it won't be that swift. But even if the speed were halved, it would still be terrifying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this thought, Osborne felt a surge of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold your horses! I don't know enough about Divine Peak Nine yet! I need to find a spot with the highest energy density that's also safe enough to relocate my Infinite Devouring Eyes from the No. 9 mining area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Divine Peak Nine is shrouded in mystery and danger. If I recklessly move my Infinite Devouring Eyes and they get destroyed, I'd be in deep trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having settled this in his mind, Osborne suppressed his impulsive desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, dawn broke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Athena should be about to assign me today's task! I wonder what kind of job she'll give me! Also, I had my Blood Clan subordinates gather intel on Divine Peak Nine, and they should have a decent amount of information by now. It's time to compile it all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he murmured to himself, a flood of information rushed into his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly sifted through the chaotic messages, analyzing them with precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, he opened his eyes, having gained a rough understanding of the situation near Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here, the daily tasks seem to fall into three main categories: Protection, Patrol, and Exploration!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, protection tasks are the safest. They mainly involve entering the nearby mining areas to safeguard the miners harnessing earth elemental power, ensuring they don't fall victim to the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
