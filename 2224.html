  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft's face paled in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a panicked shout. "What?! No! You can't kill me! If you do, Scottie won't let you get away with it! The Phantom Commerce Guild will come after you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a cold chuckle. "You really think you're that big a deal to them? Besides, for the Phantom Commerce Guild to come after me, they first need to know where I am. So, you'd better just accept your fate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, he tightened his grip around Bancroft's throat, gradually increasing the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft's eyes bulged with terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd thought that letting Osborne know his connection to the Phantom Commerce Guild would make the latter hesitate, that it would persuade Osborne to hand over the slaves and spare his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he couldn't have been more wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne showed not a shred of fear of the Phantom Commerce Guild and was hell-bent on killing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is he really not scared of the Phantom Commerce Guild's revenge?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft wondered, but he didn't have time to dwell on that thought. With a quick jerk, Osborne snapped his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ruler and the most powerful warrior of Necoton Planet, Bancroft, was now dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right away, Osborne activated Satan's Eye, sealing away both Bancroft's and Vince's memories deep in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he closed his eyes and started delving into them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, he opened his eyes again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He started with Vince's memories, and after some time, he finally found the memories related to the slaves from Celestara Planet that dated back twenty years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne searched carefully, and suddenly, a jolt of excitement coursed through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Vince's memories, he spotted his parents&mdash;bound like ordinary slaves in chains, ultimately sold to the Frenetic Storm Warband through a Translocator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth, his eyes filled with fierce determination. "Just as I thought, it's the Frenetic Storm Warband!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Frenetic Storm Warband... you better watch out! One day, I will find you! You'd better pray that my parents are still alive and haven't been tortured by you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, I'll make you pay a thousandfold!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that whispered threat, Osborne turned his attention back to Bancroft's memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, the entrance to the cavern opened again, and a dozen warships flew in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glanced up. "Ascending Sacred Sanctum, smash them to pieces! Isa, the rest is up to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he spoke, the Ascending Sacred Sanctum sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the Ascending Sacred Sanctum reduced the approaching warships to a heap of scrap. The crew members on those ships were killed in large numbers, and those who managed to survive were quickly taken care of by Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst all the chaos, Osborne stayed focused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quietly rummaged through Bancroft's memories, hoping to find a way to get in touch with Scottie or directly reach the Frenetic Storm Warband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sadly, his search turned up empty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scottie only contacted Bancroft when he needed something; he never initiated contact on his own. The only way to communicate was through the Phantom Commerce Guild's special channels when Scottie wanted Bancroft to prepare slaves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft didn't have the authority to reach out to Scottie, let alone the Frenetic Storm Warband, which he'd never even attempted to contact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a bummer!" Osborne opened his eyes, annoyed that Bancroft's memories hadn't provided any useful information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Looks like I'll have to figure this out on my own!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>It's time to make my way to Racial Convergence Planet! There, I might be able to find an intelligence network that can help me track down the Frenetic Storm Warband. And since Scottie is there too, if I can find him, I'll be able to solve everything!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, Osborne took a look around at the destruction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The high-ranking members of the Phantom Tide Demon Sect who had come to rescue Bancroft had all been wiped out by the Ascending Sacred Sanctum and Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's roll!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've got no reason to stick around on Necoton Planet any longer. We'll hop on the Translocator and head straight to Racial Convergence Planet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne motioned for Isa to tag along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they stepped out of the cavern, he conjured up flames and set the whole mountain ablaze to wipe out any evidence of the recent battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't long before they were back in Phantom Tide City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The place was deathly quiet. The members of the Phantom Tide Demon Sect were completely in the dark, clueless that their leader, Bancroft, and seven top-brass executives had been taken out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne paused for a second, weighing his options. In the end, he decided not to go after the Phantom Tide Demon Sect anymore. Sure, they were neck-deep in the slave trade and had sold his parents, but the real masterminds&mdash;the seven core leaders&mdash;were already six feet under. The rank-and-file members had no inkling about the slave business, and offing them wouldn't achieve anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go," Osborne said, then led Isa and Maddox towards the Spatial Translocator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five hundred Celestial Crystals per person to transport to Racial Convergence Planet!" The middle-aged warrior operating the Translocator said coolly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five hundred Celestial Crystals was a fortune!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne was in a bind. This was the only Cosmic Translocator that could take them to Racial Convergence Planet, so he had no alternative but to fork over the money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, though, five hundred Celestial Crystals were peanuts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took out one thousand five hundred Celestial Crystals and handed them to the guy. Then he, Isa, and Maddox stepped onto the Translocator platform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Translocator was a behemoth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Which part of Racial Convergence Planet are you three aiming for?" The middle-aged man asked with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His attitude had done a complete 180 now that Osborne had paid up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow. "We can pick the destination?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man let out a little laugh. "You must be new to using our Cosmic Translocator! Of course you can choose! Our Cosmic Translocator is linked to the Stellar Formation Diagram of Racial Convergence Planet. You can get dropped off in neutral areas, or even in the territories of the Evernight Court or the Glorious Divine Kingdom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, you won't end up in the capitals of the Evernight Court or the Glorious Divine Kingdom, mind you. It'll be some out-of-the-way places...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But once you're on Racial Convergence Planet, Cosmic Translocators are all over the place. Getting to the capitals of the Evernight Court or the Glorious Divine Kingdom will be a piece of cake."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the man finished talking, Osborne started to ponder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Where should we go?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Evernight Court or the Glorious Divine Kingdom?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly nixed the idea of going to the Evernight Court. He was a total newbie when it came to that place. As the most powerful force on Racial Convergence Planet, the Evernight Court had a ton of rules, and he wasn't up for being tied down by them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Then what about the Glorious Divine Kingdom?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew the Glorious Divine Kingdom like the back of his hand. After all, he was born there in his past life. He'd spent over a hundred years there. While Osborne couldn't say he knew every single corner, he definitely knew it better than the Evernight Court.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, he was super familiar with the capital city of the Glorious Divine Kingdom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to pay homage to his mother from his past life and, for that revenge he sought, he needed to be in the Glorious Divine Kingdom, specifically its capital city!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne realized he was still too weak. Even if he went to the capital, he wouldn't be able to do much of anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed to find a place to build up his strength first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Then we'll go to Mystic Sirius Sect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That worked perfectly. Mystic Sirius Sect was also a Second-rate Power within the Glorious Divine Kingdom. He could leverage Maddox's connections to settle there temporarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his plan formulated, Osborne spoke up, "We're going to the Glorious Divine Kingdom!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
