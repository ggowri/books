  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!" The five hundred Blood Demon members roared, with their icy, murderous glares fixed on Sin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though most of them were merely Class AAA or even Class AA, far inferior to Sin, they stood without fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>United, their strength was enough to instill fear, even in the mightiest Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Charge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like that, the Blood Demon members surged into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Well-trained and perfectly coordinated, they were a force to be reckoned with&mdash;far beyond what the Lambert family could hope to match. Their assault swept forward in waves, overwhelming Sin and leaving him no opportunity to mount another attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin's expression changed dramatically as he realized the sudden turn of events. Panic surged within him, and he immediately began retreating, desperately trying to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think you can run?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted, harnessing the power of interdimensional travel to block Sin's path. With a swift kick, he aimed a fierce blow straight at Sin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay right there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin's gloomy expression morphed into fury as he threw a powerful punch in retaliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted, "Back off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact sent Osborne flying, his body spinning through the air and spraying blood. But Sin was nonetheless forced to stay. He was promptly engulfed by the relentless onslaught of Blood Demon attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!!" Sin's shrill scream cut through the chaos as he desperately broke free from the assault's reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body was riddled with numerous wounds that, while not fatal, left him looking very embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The coordinated efforts of the five hundred Blood Demon members flowed seamlessly, like a single entity, making it impossible for Sin to fend them off. He needed distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne stuck to him like glue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew that five hundred Blood Demon members could contend with Sin's strength, but it was nearly impossible for them to take him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, a multitude of ants could take down an elephant, but only if the elephant was willing to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the elephant decided to flee, the ants would never catch up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that was exactly what Osborne aimed to prevent&mdash;he wouldn't allow Sin to </span><span>escape!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne lunged once more, unleashing every bit of his power. "Not so fast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You seemed to enjoy your little killing spree earlier. What's with the sudden urge to run? What about taking revenge for your daughter and your fallen men?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's continue!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes burned with fury as he surrounded himself with martial art aura, launching forward recklessly, even at the cost of his own safety, determined not to let Sin slip away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin was undeniably stronger; he managed to breach Osborne's martial art aura defenses, but killing Osborne proved challenging. Despite Sin inflicting numerous injuries upon Osborne, he couldn't break free from Osborne's grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the Blood Demon members were not about to waste the opportunity that Osborne had created for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The five hundred Blood Demon members transformed into a nightmarish collective of vampires, launching a frenzied assault on Sin. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although only a fraction of their strikes could land significant damage to Sin, it was more than enough to tilt the odds further against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin's face grew increasingly pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt like he was sinking into quicksand. If he didn't manage to break free soon, even his prowess as a Class S would be meaningless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But escaping wasn't an option!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clutched in his arms was Crimson, severely wounded and needing much of his strength to protect her. Faced with such a dilemma, he could neither break through Osborne's defense nor create an opening to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Damn it!" Sin howled in rage, unleashing every ounce of his strength in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Greyson, Roy, and the entire Lambert family joined forces with the Blood Demon members, launching a coordinated assault on Sin and Crimson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation for Sin grew increasingly perilous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's laughter grew more relaxed and mocking. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha! Sin and Crimson, the second and third assassins of the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization? It seems you are nothing more than that! Today, you both shall meet your end! Kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation for Sin worsened. He coughed blood violently, his strength fading rapidly, barely holding on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his weakened state, he could no longer shield Crimson from all the attacks. Crimson, already severely injured, began to cough up blood uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crimson suddenly spoke, "Sin, put me down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm beyond repair! With me, you won't make it out! If you don't let </span><span>me</span><span> go, we'll both die here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you must survive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because only if you live, can you avenge the death of me and our daughter!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Sin's hesitation, </span><span>Crimson</span><span> burst into a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, she pulled out a divine artifact dagger and drove it into her own heart!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face twisted with a fierce smile. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sin! I'm going ahead to meet our daughter! You must avenge me and our daughter! You must kill Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Crimson's head slumped, her vitality disappeared.</span></p><div class="pagination">
