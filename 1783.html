  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bryce was completely unleashed, finally giving in to his long-suppressed desire to pummel the talented fighters from other clans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, he had always been seen as the weakest. Even newcomers like Diana displayed tremendous talent and potential, making their strength nearly equal to his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Within their ranks, Bryce often felt sidelined in battles, the one who could never win&mdash;always bullied by his peers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But that didn't mean he was weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a wealth of Celestial Crystals and Miracle Elixirs at his disposal, he had reached the pinnacle of early-stage Deity King. His water elemental essence had surged to late Level Eight, while his Divine Body hovered around mid-Level Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was a true hexagonal warrior&mdash;a prodigy with no apparent weaknesses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While Bryce sat at the bottom of the rankings among his peers, it wasn't due to a lack of strength; it was simply because those around him were exceptionally powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the eight across from him, he felt a rush of exhilaration, for they paled in comparison to the likes of Diana, Hannah, Zoe, and Mila, with whom he regularly sparred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They simply weren't on the same level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Empowered by this realization, Bryce launched his ferocious assault, unleashing massive waves of elemental energy that slammed into the eight challengers, overwhelming them completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The transformation left everyone shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just moments ago, their opponents had been brimming with confidence, ready to take down Bryce and Kendra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Bryce stood as a gladiator, and his opponents could do little but scramble defensively, their initial bravado evaporating in the face of his overwhelming might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What kind of monster is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why is his strength so immense? We're all early-stage Deity Kings! How come our attacks have no effect on him, while he's making us look like amateurs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Seriously! What level is his elemental essence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What about his Divine Body?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The eight were at their wit's end, their nerves fraying under the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thankfully, despite Bryce's brutal onslaught, as long as they worked together, they could fend off his attacks, at least for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They clung to a hope that his divine power would eventually run dry, giving them their much-anticipated chance to counterattack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But just then, Kendra decided to step into the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Having far surpassed Bryce in strength, she was on par with Zoe and Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Calm and collected, she launched her own offensive without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fiery flames instantly coalesced into a massive, blistering fist, raging with intensity as it shot toward the eight warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caught off guard by this sudden escalation, the adversaries felt a shiver run down their spines as they struggled to defend against Bryce's relentless assault. Their realization of an even greater threat left them stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The very next second, the flaming fist struck, shattering their divine power defenses like glass. The sheer force of Kendra's blow sent them flying, igniting each of their Divine Bodies as they crumpled to the ground in a smoldering heap, resembling charred remnants of their former selves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they lay there, gasping for air, Kendra casually dusted her hands off with an air of nonchalance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bryce's expression soured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kendra, what are you doing?! I was just getting warmed up! Why'd you end the fight? I was enjoying myself! You know how rare it is to face such weak opponents?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After getting pummeled by you guys so many times, I finally found a chance to turn the tables! And you just had to take them all down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Can't you at least leave one for me to play with?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bryce felt a mix of frustration and disappointment, his body itching for more action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It just hadn't been satisfying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kendra shot him an exasperated look. "What's with the sulking? Don't forget our goal! We're here to make a name for ourselves in Celestara, not to play around! If you keep this up, they'll think we're weak&mdash;struggling against just eight early-stage Deity Kings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bryce's face darkened at her words, but he couldn't argue with her logic. "But I didn't get to really enjoy myself..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Relax! There's more to come! Once we take down all the young talents from the other clans, those old-timers will be itching to jump in. Trust me, I'll make sure you get your chance to let loose then!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bryce said, "Yeah, I think I'll pass on that..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Bryce and Kendra murmured to each other, making their way back, the stunned crowd of onlookers remained frozen in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once again, they had been defeated!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings had sent just two representatives and effortlessly wiped out the eight-member squad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each of those eight was a renowned prodigy in their own right, celebrated across their clans as top-tier talents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And yet, in a matter of moments, they had been utterly crushed by just two opponents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Could the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings really be that powerful?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, over a million spectators from various clans fell silent, their expressions tense and anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Can our young generation really defeat the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
