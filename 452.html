  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa coldly stated, "Alexander, feel free to use whatever tricks you have left. I already told you I would never marry you. Either Osborne comes to take me away, or I will leave my corpse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was filled with jealousy, envious that the beautiful Clarissa was so devoted to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "What makes him better than me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What is Osborne even worth to be compared to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He replied coolly, "Very well. If Osborne shows up, I will torture him to death in front of you, ensuring you give up altogether."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Alexander did not strike immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that without using his full power, it would be impossible to defeat Clarissa. And if he did unleash it, the destructive force would be uncontrollable and would destroy the backstage area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the staff would be exposed to everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was an immeasurable divine artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could obtain it, he would no longer fear those super geniuses from Newport City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, the staff absolutely could not be exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For that reason, he was willing to forgo the wedding with Clarissa. As long as Clarissa couldn't escape, they could hold the wedding again at any time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Alexander instructed his subordinates, "Tell all the guests that today's wedding is temporarily canceled due to unavoidable circumstances. Let them leave the Paltrow Estate for now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Alexander coldly stared at Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa frowned but said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was pleased to see the wedding canceled because she also didn't want the Fate Staff to be known by more people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the longer the delay, the more likely Osborne would arrive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, news of the wedding cancellation spread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guests buzzed with conversation, but ultimately, no one caused a scene. Most of the guests complied and left the Paltrow Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quickly, the once lively wedding venue turned quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, not everyone left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the VIP section, Evelynn, Charlie, and others remained. The disciples dared not drive them away and could only let them stay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie smiled, "Shall we go check out the excitement in the back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn smiled, "No rush. Since Alexander has let the guests leave, he is clearly preparing to go all out. That small backstage area isn't enough to be his battlefield, so he will show up soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am just curious how the Fatebearer, with her power level not reaching Class A, managed to force Alexander to go all out. Moreover, her power gives me a feeling of great purity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Evelynn spoke, she fell into deep thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie shrugged, feeling too lazy to consider it. "Once they come out, everything will be clear."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sensed that the guests had left and let out a cruel laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, I will give you one last chance&mdash;hand over the staff and marry me, and you might endure less suffering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, I will have to go all out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa ignored him and instead looked at Dylan and Eugen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan and Eugen were also in a difficult position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade and the previous head of the Paltrow family, Robert, were watching them from nearby. They were both Class A masters, and even if Dylan and Eugen wanted to help Clarissa, they couldn't do anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan and Eugen could only express their apologies to Clarissa with their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa smiled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that my fate is on my own. My family cannot help me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, she fixed her gaze on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's fight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression turned fierce. "Since that is the case, don't blame me. I have given you enough tolerance, but sadly, you do not appreciate it. Today, no one can save you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Alexander raised both hands and immediately, dark clouds rolled in above the Paltrow Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These clouds brewed terrifying power within them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I control the power of the God of Thunder."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander declared coldly, "Even if you have divine artifacts, you are still only at Class B+. You cannot withstand my power. You are bound to lose."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Alexander brought his raised hands down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, countless bolts of thunder rained down violently toward Clarissa's head, one after another, densely packed and radiating purple light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's expression turned extremely serious. She felt a stinging pain on her skin, but she did not show any fear. Instead, she raised the Fate Staff high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A rich glow emanated from the Fate Staff, forming a transparent shield that enveloped Clarissa within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying thunder crashed against the transparent shield. In an instant, the backstage collapsed, quickly turning into charred fragments under the relentless assaults of the lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bolts of thunder continued to strike, pounding against the transparent shield. The shield vibrated violently, gradually becoming thinner and weaker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the transparent shield could not withstand the endless hammering of the lightning, and it began to crack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's face turned pale in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I really unable to hold on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, where are you? If you don't show up soon, I will have to leave you behind."</span></p><div class="pagination">
