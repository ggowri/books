  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Frederick revealed a confident smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at Osborne, Adriana, May, and Brittany blocking the secret stronghold, as if they were already dead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "They're just four Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors. How dare they fight against nearly fifty of us Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They're courting death!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, under Frederick's command, all the Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors beside him began unleashing their power, preparing for the strongest attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll give you one last chance. If you give up fighting and submit to me, I won't kill you and will give you a chance to serve as my slaves!" Frederick said arrogantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana sneered coldly, full of disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick was extremely displeased. "You're all about to die, yet you remain so stubborn. I have to admire your courage, but your stupidity has cost you your last chance to live!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kill them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, nearly fifty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors, including Callista, moved simultaneously. At this moment, they were all frantically gathering power, preparing to unleash their strongest attack to kill everyone in the Fairy Moon Sect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, something unusual happened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among the nearly fifty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors, eighteen suddenly unleashed their power early. However, instead of attacking Osborne, Adriana, and the others, they turned on their own companions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These people never expected their companions to suddenly attack them. Even though they reacted quickly and immediately tried to defend and dodge, it was still too late.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eighteen terrifying attacks instantly engulfed at least ten Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors, accompanied by deafening explosions. At the same time, piercing screams echoed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, at least three people were killed outright, while several others were injured to varying degrees.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick was instantly puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are you doing?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He angrily glared at the eighteen Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors, his eyes cold. "Didn't you hear my orders clearly? I told you to kill those from Fairy Moon Sect, so why are you attacking your own companions?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The eighteen people let out cold laughs, completely ignoring him, and quickly appeared beside Osborne, staring coldly at Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick looked utterly shocked at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne finally laughed and said, "Emperor Frederick, there's no need to shout! They've already made a new choice. They are mine now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick was shocked once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your people? How is that possible! They have long submitted to me. How could they betray me and become yours?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He coldly stared at the eighteen people again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Give me an explanation!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The eighteen people remained silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne laughed, "Explanation? Why should they explain to you? I told you long ago, did you really think you had won? This time, it's not you wiping us out, but us completely destroying you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick's face darkened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But soon, he suppressed his anger and couldn't help but laugh, "You really surprised me! I truly didn't expect you to turn my people against me. You've shocked me once again!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, do you think this will turn the tide? Even if these eighteen people betrayed me and became yours, you're still the ones who will die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all, you only have twenty-two Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And on my side, there are still twenty-six alive!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick sneered, "The advantage is still mine! The ultimate victor will definitely be me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne laughed again, "We don't only have twenty-two Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors. Take another look, who are they!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He suddenly waved his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Weston, Quinn, Naomi, and Hendrix appeared beside Osborne, respectfully bowing to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Master!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, the surroundings became incredibly silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick and Callista were utterly shocked as they watched Weston, Quinn, Naomi, and Hendrix bow to Osborne and call him Master.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick's face instantly turned extremely grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He roared, "You four bastards!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even you have betrayed me?! I am your father! How dare you betray me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Weston, Quinn, Naomi, and Hendrix completely ignored Frederick and continued to look at Osborne respectfully.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne laughed, "Stop shouting! They stopped seeing you as their father long ago! After all, you're so cold and ruthless, even willing to kill your own children at any moment. Isn't their betrayal perfectly normal?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You deserve to be abandoned and scorned by everyone! You're unfit to be a father, and unworthy to be the emperor of the Glorious Divine Kingdom! So today, you're doomed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's gaze turned icy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, you have twenty-six Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors, and I have twenty-six as well! Most importantly, several on your side are injured."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now the advantage is mine!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick was utterly furious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had no way to refute Osborne's words. He originally thought he held an absolute advantage, but the situation turned around in an instant, and he ended up at a disadvantage!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he didn't panic; his expression just grew colder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You bastard, you deserve to die! If I don't kill you today, you'll become a huge threat sooner or later! Do you think you have the upper hand?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then let's see who the real winner will be in the end!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kill them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick gave the order directly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne snorted coldly and waved his hand as well. "Kill them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, a terrifying battle erupted. Fifty-two Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors clashed madly. The terrifying energy fluctuations instantly shattered everything around, turning it into ruins.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Adriana walked toward Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne charged toward Callista.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She glared at him with a cold gaze and shouted, "I truly regret not crushing you to death back then, not obliterating your soul! That&rsquo;s what led to this situation today! If I had another chance, I would kill you and your mother without hesitation!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered, "Does regret help? If you truly regret, you should regret targeting us back then! Everything today is your own doing. I will kill you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Sacred Power Arrow on his Bloodwrought Bow shot out swiftly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista waved her hand, shattering the Sacred Power Arrow with terrifying force. She sneered, "You ridiculous bastard! You're merely an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warrior, and you think you can kill me? How laughable! You're no match for me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly. She was a Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior. Without using the Apocalypse Bow, it would indeed be difficult for him to defeat her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he had a way!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He waved into the distance, and Weston quickly appeared beside him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista immediately frowned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She shouted, "Weston! Come to me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Weston ignored her and respectfully faced Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Master! What are your orders?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and pointed at Callista, instructing, "This woman is yours to deal with! Beat her up badly, but don't kill her! She's still useful to me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Weston immediately nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, Master!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he stared coldly at Callista.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was completely stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Weston was her biological son, her proudest son!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, he was actually following Osborne's orders to go against her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She felt Weston had lost his mind!</span></p><div class="pagination">
