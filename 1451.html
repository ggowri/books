  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne finished speaking, the human servants froze, exchanging bewildered glances, unable to believe their ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They mused, "Is this really our master, Lachlan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Lachlan they knew was a strict taskmaster, demanding perfection from his servants. Any sign of dissatisfaction would lead to punishment, and bowing was just the bare minimum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There had been a time when one servant, failing to notice Lachlan's arrival and not bowing immediately, had incurred his wrath. In front of the entire household, Lachlan had beaten him to death&mdash;a gruesome spectacle that haunted the rest of the servants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all belonged to Lachlan now, having been bought and sold as property, their lives entirely at his mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after such a brutal act, Lachlan faced no consequences; the law viewed the lives of his slaves as inconsequential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The horrifying memory of that bloody scene left a deep scar on the servants' minds. Ever since, they had </span><span>prostrate</span><span> in fear at the sight of Lachlan, trembling with terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, however, he was telling them they didn't need to bow anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't comprehend it. "Is this a trick? A prelude to a darker intention? Are we being lured into a trap?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of defying him sent chills down their spines, and they remained frozen in place, too terrified to rise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne observed the group of human servants, a frown creasing his brow. Memories of Lachlan's past flooded his mind, and a wave of pity washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their fate was far worse than that of the miners toiling day and night in the pits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least those miners had their freedom, their identities intact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These servants had never been treated like human beings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Slaves&hellip;" Osborne murmured, the word tasting bitter on his tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even on Blue Planet, slavery had nearly vanished, at least among ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, it was a grim reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Wild Flame City, the slave trade thrived openly, with bustling markets in the heart of the city where anyone with enough money could purchase slaves and do as they </span><span>pleased</span><span> with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Human slaves were the most numerous, stripped of all rights, their names and identities recorded in slave registries, unable to resist or escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most had been captured by powerful factions among the various races and forced into servitude, displayed like merchandise in the slave markets for the wealthy to buy and sell at will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of anger and determination ignited within Osborne as he contemplated this injustice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The slave </span><span>market</span><span>! I remember the one in Wild Flame City, backed by the Demonic Dragon Clan and the Soaring Lion Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They use it as a cash cow, capturing humans and selling them off to other factions&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One day, I will destroy that slave market and set all human slaves free! I will wipe out the Demonic Dragon Clan and the Soaring Lion Clan, making sure no one dares to capture Human Community individuals and force them into slavery again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that fierce resolution burning in his heart, Osborne took a deep breath, quickly regaining his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Demonic Dragon Clan and the Soaring Lion Clan were two of the three major upper-tier races in Wild Flame City, residing high atop the floating mountains to the west and south of the city, respectively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They occupied a realm of power that was nearly unfathomable. Alongside them was </span><span>the Mystic Feather Clan, all three at the top of the hierarchy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his current strength, Osborne was nowhere near capable of challenging the Demonic Dragon Clan or the Soaring Lion Clan, let alone dismantling their slave trade network.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patience was essential now. Furthermore, liberating all Human Community slaves required more than just dealing with these two factions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Numerous other powerful entities had grown accustomed to the benefits of Human Community servitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne aimed to rescue the enslaved individuals, he knew he would inevitably have to confront the entire power structure of Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For now, I have to bide my time," he reminded himself, acknowledging the need to temper his instincts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Acting recklessly would only jeopardize his plans. When he garnered enough strength to effect real change, then he would seek retribution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, his focus was on helping the group of enslaved Human Community individuals before him. He was determined to erase their enslaved statuses and restore their freedom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a clear goal in mind, Osborne hurried into Lachlan's room, searching every nook and cranny until he stumbled upon a locked safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, he found what he was after&mdash;dozens of slave contracts, each a key to freedom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armed with this small stack of documents, he returned to where the frightened human figures awaited, their eyes wide with a mix of fear and uncertainty. A reassuring smile broke across Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be afraid. I'm not here to hurt you. I'm here to help you reclaim your freedom! With these slave contracts, I'm going to the slave market to remove your names from their registry. When I come back, you won't be slaves anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group stared at Osborne in stunned silence, incredulity written on their faces as he turned and strode out with purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was on his way to the slave market, the only place where he could truly change their fates and restore their identities.</span></p><div class="pagination">
