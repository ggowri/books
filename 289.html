  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan </span><span>scoffed,</span><span> disbelief etched across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not a waste of space? You think I'd say something like that without checking him out first? An orphan raised in a rundown orphanage, marrying into the Caldwell family for money? And you dare claim he's not a waste?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> you're saying he has some potential?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What good is his so-called potential? To any old family, his little talents are worthless!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does it really matter if he's Class C? Class C+? Or even Class B?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all meaningless. Do you get it? Clarissa is a Fatebearer. Her husband needs a legacy, a strong background, and undeniable talent. Without those, he wouldn't stand a chance against the power she carries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that fate power backfires on Clarissa, it could drag the entire Radcliffe family into a bottomless pit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna opened her mouth but faltered, words eluding her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa, on the other hand, looked ready to argue back until she suddenly turned and glanced toward the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne walked in, calm and collected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!" Clarissa wasted no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rushed over and threw herself into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holding her close, Osborne felt her body tremble slightly, igniting a wave of empathy within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gently patted her back and whispered soothingly, "Clarissa, it's okay. I know everything now. No need to worry. Remember, we promised to shoulder this together, didn't we?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, let's face this head-on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words sent another shiver through Clarissa, but she nodded determinedly in his embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she took Osborne's hand, locking eyes with Dylan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He, too, met Dylan's glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan's face darkened, frustration boiling inside him as he watched his daughter practically leap into Osborne's arms, comforted by the very person he deemed a failure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anger welled within him like a raging storm. "You little brat, let go of Clarissa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, maintained his hold. He greeted Dylan politely, "Hello, Mr. Dylan Radcliffe. I'm Osborne, your so-called 'waste', Clarissa's boyfriend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan's expression soured even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what's your point? What, are you trying to show off now? Clarissa's boyfriend? I never agreed to that. Who says you have a right to be with her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calm and composed, Osborne replied, "Mr. Dylan Radcliffe, I'm dating Clarissa. Whether you approve or not, that fact doesn't change. If you support us, it'll make for a much happier situation. But if you try to come between us...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then Clarissa and I will fight tooth and nail against you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan burst into laughter, a sound laced with derision and mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Against me? With what? Do you think you can stand against me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't sugarcoat it. I see you as a waste. You don't belong with Clarissa. What gives you the right to pursue her? What gives you the right to defy me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt the anger bubbling beneath his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that if he didn't reveal his true identity and background, there was no chance Dylan would ever approve of him staying with Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now was the time to lay it all on the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Clarissa, he decided to come clean about being the owner of Skyefall Security Services and Luna Jewelry. Not to mention, he was a Class B+ metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing that this information would shatter Dylan's assumptions, he prepared to speak, but before he could, Dylan cut him off again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen. If you know what's good for you, you'll walk away from Clarissa. She deserves way better than you. As her father, I've already lined up a marriage that suits her perfectly. Her future husband will be far more accomplished and powerful than you could ever dream!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing the news, Osborne furrowed his brows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Has Dylan already arranged a new marriage for Clarissa?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a sense of foreboding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan continued with a sneer, "Boy, do you know who I have found as a husband for Clarissa? He is Alexander, the heir to the Dampston's Paltrow family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Osborne exclaimed in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa and Donna's faces suddenly hardened at Dylan's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Barlyn, who had been silent until now, couldn't help but gasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, who had never heard of Alexander, looked confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn bit his lip and explained, "Osborne, I know </span><span>this</span><span> Alexander. He is the heir to the Paltrow family, and the Paltrow family is the most powerful ancient family in neighboring Dampston. They are at least among the top three, if not the first. Their </span><span>strength far exceeds that of our Radcliffe family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And Alexander is well-known in both Dampston and Skyefall. It is said that when he was born, there were strange phenomena in the sky, and thunder roared for a whole night. He activated his lightning power as soon as he was born, making him a once-in-a-century metahuman genius of the Paltrow family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's only twenty-eight years old, but it's rumored that he's already on the verge of becoming a Class A power master. If he succeeds, he will definitely be one of the most outstanding young people in Rosmandi."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Barlyn finished speaking, Dylan looked pleased with himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barlyn is right. The future husband I have chosen for Clarissa is Alexander. After learning about Clarissa's situation and seeing her photos, he is very satisfied with her and strongly demands that the wedding be held soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa's grandfather agrees with this arrangement as well!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only someone with Alexander's status and background, only a prodigy like Alexander, can match Clarissa and bear the fate power she carries."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he gave Osborne a cold look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boy, do you think you're not a waste? Do you think you can compare to Alexander?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
