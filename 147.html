  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Satan's Eye had already reached level four, giving him a terrifyingly powerful ability to see through objects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those cramped and rundown wooden shacks in the slum couldn't block his sight as he quickly searched for Raymond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, the houses were too densely packed. Osborne couldn't see the entire slum at once and could only see the conditions inside about a dozen houses at a time, forcing him to search deeper bit by bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his vision, the slums seemed like an exposed young girl revealing all their secrets to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne saw a group of shabbily dressed individuals in one of the wooden houses, injecting something into their arms. It was obvious that it had to be drugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also saw, in another wooden house, a child of about twelve or thirteen being beaten by a group of gang members because he hadn't stolen enough during the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne then saw women trying to make a living, serving men on cramped beds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were also fights, robberies, gambling, and countless other dreadful scenes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All sorts of chaos appeared in Osborne's vision, making it seem like a completely different world from Clarissa's luxurious manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed, chose not to interfere, and continued to search for Raymond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne suddenly heard a faint cry for help. "Please help me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shifted his vision in the direction of the sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately after, Osborne saw a group of gang members violently dragging a girl into a wooden house through a narrow alley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were six gang members, all looking to be in their twenties, with various colored hairs. They were all excitedly dragging the girl into the house, and it was clear as day what they intended to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne initially didn't want to get involved, not wanting to make a commotion and risk Raymond discovering him, which could jeopardize his mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, this kind of thing happened far too often in these troubled areas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But eventually, Osborne stopped in his tracks, his expression turning to surprise because he had seen the girl's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the girl struggled, she lifted her head, revealing an incredibly beautiful face, which was remarkably clean compared to her shabby, old clothes. Her face was filled with fear and panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it wasn't these aspects that surprised Osborne. What truly shocked him was how much the girl's face resembled Anastasia's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw the girl's face, he nearly thought it was Anastasia waking up from her coma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he noticed the slight differences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne realized that the girl wasn't Anastasia but someone who bore an uncanny resemblance, almost like a twin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing the girl who looked exactly like Anastasia about to be dragged into the room by the gang members, he was instantly filled with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't care about causing a commotion and potentially alerting his target anymore. He charged forward at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, the girl had already been dragged into the room. After all, she was just a girl in her twenties, while the others were six gang members. How could she possibly resist?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gang members shut the door and excitedly began to undress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop struggling, sweet pie!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just be good and let us have a good time, and we might even let you go. Otherwise, don't be surprised if we bury you alive once we're done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Behave now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the gang members threatened her while waving a knife at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl shook uncontrollably, her eyes full of hopelessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as Osborne was about to break in, the girl suddenly lunged at the young man wielding the knife. Somehow, she managed to muster her strength and snatch the knife from his hand in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, she stabbed the knife into his neck with all her might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Splurt! A gush of blood then sprayed out, splattering the girl's pretty face. She, however, didn't show any fear. Instead, she pulled out the knife and stabbed the young man over and over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, the light in the young man's eyes quickly faded away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clearly hadn't expected to die at the hands of a girl, but it was too late for regrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other five gang members, seeing their companion being stabbed to death, were instantly furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You damn bitch. You're asking for it now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get her knife!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They shouted as they charged at the girl. But instead of panic, her eyes were filled with rage and a desire to kill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll kill you all!" She screamed as she fiercely swung the knife again, aiming it at another young man's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, she was too slow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The knife in her hand only left a cut on the young man's arm before he grabbed her arm tightly and threw her to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the young man clutched his bleeding arm, his face twisted with rage, and he snarled, "You fucking bitch. How dare you kill Sonny? And you even stabbed me, too?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to make you suffer until you die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll lock you up and have men torment you until you're dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And now, I'll be the first to have my turn with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the young man finished his furious rant, he sprang forward and pounced on the girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were now full of hopelessness. As she envisioned her dreadful fate, tears fell down her cheeks. She closed her eyes, preparing for the nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the door was flung open with a loud bang, and someone dashed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'd like to see who dares to harm her!" A chilling voice echoed through the cramped room, sounding as if it was from the depths of hell.</span></p><div class="pagination">
