  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne stared at Isa in utter disbelief.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He could sense that the power Isa had unleashed was not overwhelmingly strong, certainly within the realm of Class AAA. If Osborne were to give it his all, transforming into a vampire and employing the Breath of Celestial technique, his strength might even surpass hers.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, the damage he had inflicted upon Marvin paled in comparison to what Isa had achieved with such ease.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A mere casual kick from her had gravely injured Marvin, an S-class Supreme Overlord.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Considering his recent ascension to Class S and absence from the Quasi-Divine Rankings, Marvin was an ordinary S-class Supreme Overlord.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, he possessed the undeniable prowess of Class S.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa, merely at Class AAA, had dealt Marvin a devastating blow.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne struggled to comprehend this, as did Marvin.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With great effort, Marvin rose to his feet, his gaze now tinged with fear as he looked upon Isa.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">An S-class Supreme Overlord was afraid of an AAA-class opponent?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne felt as though the world had turned upside down.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa, however, seemed unfazed. She calmly stated, "You see? An S-class Supreme Overlord is nothing special. With superior combat skills, defeating one as an AAA-class is actually quite simple."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Simple?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's voice held a hint of bitterness. He had believed that reaching Class AAA had narrowed the gap between him and Isa. With his various aces up his sleeve, he had even dared to think he could hold his own against her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, he realized the vast distance that still lay between them.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He murmured, "No wonder she made it onto the Godson Rankings!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The others in the top ten might rely on powerful divine artifacts to challenge or defeat S-class Supreme Overlords.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But none could match Isa's feat of injuring a Class S Supreme Overlord so severely with her bare hands."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne looked at Isa with a mix of admiration and bewilderment.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they first met, he knew she was strong, but he had not grasped the extent of her power.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa was like an unfathomable abyss.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Regardless of his class, whether from C to AAA, her formidable strength still sent a jolt of surprise through him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa remained an enigma to him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You'll have to teach me later," Osborne said.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing this, Isa smiled, teasing, "Teach you so you can defeat me? Because if you win, you can do anything to me, right?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was stunned.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He touched his nose sheepishly. "Well, you've got to teach me then, or you might as well leave and let him beat me to a pulp."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's gotten into you, acting all spoiled?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A faint smile played on Isa's lips as she approached Osborne. With a tender touch, she caressed his face and whispered, "What's this now? My man resorts to acting like a spoiled child?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne rolled his eyes.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Enough of your flirting!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The moment of levity was shattered by Marvin's furious shout.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn woman, I underestimated you, but do you think you can defeat me so easily? You have no idea what an S-class Supreme Overlord is capable of! Even the number one on the Godson Rankings couldn't best me!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin launched another assault.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A terrifying shockwave burst forth from him, engulfing the space around them. Osborne felt instantly as if a mountain had descended upon him, whose movements were stifled under the immense pressure. Marvin's attacks were relentless. Each strike was laced with the intent to obliterate both Osborne and Isa.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa merely scoffed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seemingly unfazed, she turned slowly to deliver another kick.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Such a racket!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can't you see I'm flirting with my man? Get lost. I'll deal with you later!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her words were followed by a resounding crash as Marvin was sent flying backward once more, bleeding profusely before crashing to the ground. He struggled to rise, but it was futile.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was dumbfounded.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "What kind of technique was this?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa's power, while not overtly formidable, had achieved terrifying results against an unstoppable S-class foe like Marvin."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa turned to Osborne with a smile, "Tell me honestly, while I was gone, did you go out and charm other women? Like that Emma Augustine?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After speaking, Isa tilted her head slightly to stare at Osborne. Her beautiful face was adorned with a smile, yet there was something unmistakably mischievous, perhaps even malevolent, in the curve of her lips.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne suddenly froze.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Isa, do you know that?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmph!" Isa snorted. "I warned you not to attract other women, and yet you've hit on another woman? You really deserve a beating!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne looked embarrassed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's this? Speak!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sorry!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne offered an apology without further explanation.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa snorted again, "Is that all? But who told me to have feelings for you? I won't blame you this time!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Make sure to remind her later who your real girlfriend is!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing her words, Osborne was stunned.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He braced himself for her wrath, expecting a flurry of blows, but instead, she simply forgave him. Just like that?</p><div class="pagination">
