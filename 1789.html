  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tristram's expression darkened at Osborne's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His situation mirrored Ambrose's earlier predicament. He had expected that his grand entrance would pressure the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings into a serious fight, forcing them to face him and his team in a direct confrontation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet here he was, facing merely two opponents from that formidable group, which felt like an insult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While he felt the sting of being underestimated, Tristram did not erupt in rage like Ambrose had. Instead, he said coldly, "Theodore, you're too arrogant! Do you really think sending just these two will suffice against us? We are the noble Paramount Supreme Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne simply shrugged, his demeanor unfazed. "Noble? In my eyes, the Paramount Supreme Clan is also Human Community. If you can defeat them, I might consider stepping in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tristram scoffed, his resolve hardening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fine! Just watch me closely! I hope you won't regret it when I take them down. Let's do this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, he signaled for Diana and Mila to take the lead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two exchanged glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's fight!" Mila declared, hurtling into the sky above the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A brilliant aura of light erupted around her, engulfing her in a radiance so powerful she resembled a living sun. The holy light cast a divine glow over the entire stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Tristram and his companions felt their divine power defenses thrumming wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tristram's face shifted from confidence to concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Light Power! Such incredible strength. If I'm not mistaken, your light elemental essence is at least mid-Level Eight, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But do you really think that's enough to defeat me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's a pipe dream! My dark power is no less formidable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A rumble shook the ground as black energy surged around Tristram, enveloping him like a dark sky, pushing back the holy light. Now, the arena was split starkly in two&mdash;one half illuminated by radiant light, the other shrouded in thick darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was truly a battle of light versus dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tristram locked his gaze onto Mila, a mocking smile on his face. "How does it feel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mila met his gaze steadily with her calm demeanor. "You're definitely a step above those who came before, but it's still not enough! Your dark power is nowhere close to Hannah's or Theodore's!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tristram's expression darkened further. "How dare you say my dark power is weaker than Hannah's or Theodore's? Do you know who trained me? My dark power has been honed under the esteemed Lord Malevolence himself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They can't even compare! Now, I'll show you just how powerful I really am!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a swift motion, Tristram gestured to the seven masked figures behind him. "You take care of that woman! This girl is mine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Understood!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The seven elite warriors of the Paramount Supreme Clan turned their icy gazes toward Diana, their intent clear and dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana took a deep breath to steady herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mila looked concerned. "Diana, are you sure you can handle this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry about me! I'll be fine!" Diana replied, her voice firm with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gripping her Supreme Malevolence Sword tightly, she declared, "I may be the weakest among the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, but I won't tarnish our name!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I will win!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Diana charged forward, engaging in a fierce battle against the seven masked adversaries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ha! You're better off minding your own business!" Tristram sneered, summoning an expanse of darkness intended to envelop Mila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mila's expression turned steely. "You think I'm afraid of you? Holy Light Sword!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mila radiated with the brilliance of holy light, transforming it into a barrage of shimmering blades that shot toward the encroaching dark sky, piercing through the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tristram's expression shifted to one of serious concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not bad, but in the end, victory will belong to me! Let's finish this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a resounding boom, the arena erupted into a fierce battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The air crackled with energy as the clash intensified. Bryce, Kendra, and the others watched on, their faces etched with worry as the situation escalated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This fight was shaping up to be the most intense one yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The confrontation between light and dark was brutal, and neither Mila nor Tristram seemed to gain the upper hand. Meanwhile, Diana was locked in a fierce struggle against the seven elite warriors of the Paramount Supreme Clan. The outcome remained uncertain, leaving the spectators on edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bryce and the others tightened their fists, rallying their support for Mila and Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the expressions on the faces of the various races were gloomy and foreboding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Out of sheer desperation, they knew Tristram and his allies had no real advantage here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite fighting fiercely and showing flashes of hope, they still outnumbered Mila and Diana&mdash;eight to two!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Tristram were to somehow claim a victory in this scenario, it would be a hollow win that brought them nothing but shame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And who was to say they would even win?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if we somehow win this, it's embarrassing&mdash;two of them against eight of us! We have to at least take down those two! That might save some face for us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Losing this fight is not an option! If we fail now, we'll be the laughingstock of our races and the Paramount Supreme Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the battle raged on, all they could do was watch and pray for a glimmer of hope in this dire confrontation.</span></p><div class="pagination">
