  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me put an end to this. I don't want to waste any more time with you. I am eager to awaken Sebastian and announce to him that I win this battle." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Gerardo waved his hand again to give orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, a full two hundred Class S clones charged out, rushing towards Greyson, Bryce, and the other Class S warriors, unleashing terrifying attacks along with the remaining Tauren Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greyson and the others had initially been at an absolute advantage, able to stop this group of Tauren Kings from destroying the energy cannons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thousands of energy cannons could finally turn their focus to attacking the clones that were slaughtering drones and robots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation was initially favorable for the coalition forces, but with the addition of two hundred Class S clones, the favor shifted instantly towards the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fewer than fifty Class S warriors suddenly faced a total of two hundred fifty Class S clones, increasing their pressure tenfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the previous moment, Bryce had been swinging the Trident of Poseidon and slaughtering Tauren Kings. In the next moment, he found himself in a bitter struggle, covered in numerous wounds. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Osborne gave him the Crystal of Life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, every Class S warrior received a Crystal of Life. Although they were injured, the Crystals allowed for rapid recovery. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the continued difficulty in holding their ground, they managed to hold on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This surprised Gerardo. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still not enough to break them? Then, I'll add a little more. Show me how long you can hold on." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo waved his hand again, sending out another two hundred Class S clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Class S warriors of the coalition forces now had to face over four hundred Class S clones. At this point, they truly could not hold on any longer. But this was not the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo murmured, "</span><span>Augustines</span><span>, I'm disappointed. I thought you could last longer. Since that's the case, all of you shall die. The underworld of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> is mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing his words, the last two hundred Class S clones beside him swiftly charged out. Their target remained the Class S warriors like Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the fewer than fifty members of the coalition forces were facing over six hundred Class S clones, a numerical disadvantage of more than ten times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The coalition forces could no longer hold on. The energy cannons were no longer </span><span>assisting the combat drones and robots. They were firing with full force to support Bryce and the others, but they still could not withstand the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Class S warrior from a superpower, facing dozens of Class S clones' attacks, finally could not bear it and was blasted to pieces. Then came the second, the third.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with attacks from such a significant numerical advantage, they could do nothing to defend themselves. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their defenses shattered, heavy injuries appeared on their bodies, and even the Crystal of Life could not save them in time, as their bodies were directly obliterated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More and more Class S warriors fell into danger and despair. Wesson's face turned pale. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew he couldn&rsquo;t wait longer. Each of these Class S warriors was incredibly important. If they all died, the coalition forces would be finished. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Wesson prepared to join the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was just an ordinary Class S, even weaker than Bryce. His involvement could not possibly change the current situation. But he held the Godfather's scepter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson raised the Godfather's scepter high, and in an instant, the distant mountain seemed to come alive as a terrifying power gathered atop the scepter, emitting a black ghostly light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You shall die now." Wesson brought his hands down, and the black light shot out from the Godfather's scepter, enveloping a group of thirty clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those thirty clones, engulfed by the black light, did not even have time to scream before their bodies rapidly dissolved. All thirty Class S clones perished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson raised the Godfather's scepter high again. "Kill."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black light gathered once more and attacked another group of clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another batch of Class S clones died instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce and the others became invigorated. Previously trapped in desperation, they now saw a glimmer of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they still faced over five hundred Class S clones, judging by Wesson's current killing speed, as long as he launched another twenty or so attacks, he could take them all down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Godfather's scepter is invincible," someone shouted excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph." Just at that moment, a cold snort sounded. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo suddenly appeared before Wesson. His eyes were filled with greed as he stared at the Godfather's scepter in Wesson's hand. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that the Godfather's scepter?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
