  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and Primordial had fully merged by now, allowing for rapid communication that would only seem like thoughtful contemplation to the Creation Herald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He patiently awaited an answer from Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Osborne glancing his way, the Creation Herald couldn't help but ask, "So, what's the verdict? Have you thought it through? Trust me; this isn't as dangerous as you think! I'll equip you with protection. Plus, when it comes time for action, I'll be all in, using my true form to tangle up our adversary so he can't just return to his lair."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne put on a face that made it seem like he was wrestling with the decision. Finally, he gritted his teeth and said, "I can agree to help you, but you need to promise me some serious perks first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald's smile widened at that. "Absolutely! Just name it! Miracle Elixirs? Celestial Crystals? Or perhaps a super divine artifact? Whatever you want!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Osborne declared, "I want one million Miracle Elixirs! And 10 billion Celestial Crystals! Plus, throw in a hundred super divine artifacts even stronger than the Supreme Sovereign's Armor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald froze, jaw dropping in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, his eyes narrowed dangerously as his expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you joking with me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew you'd ask for something big, but you're being completely ridiculous! A million Miracle Elixirs, 10 billion Celestial Crystals? And a hundred super divine artifacts stronger than Supreme Sovereign's Armor?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's insane! Even if I had them, I wouldn't give them to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald's voice was laced with frustration and anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suppressed a smirk, confident that the Creation Herald could certainly deliver those demands. "If you don't agree, then go ahead and kill me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think I wouldn't dare?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald's face turned icy, a flicker of menace flashing through his eyes. Osborne felt a chill running down his spine, sensing the weight of the threat hanging in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he stood unflinching, locking eyes with the Creation Herald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, you might have the guts to kill me. But if you do, who's going to help you? There are so few with spatial power in this world! Even if you find someone else, do you really think they'll match my abilities? Or that they'll be more reliable than me? If you believe that, feel free to pull the trigger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual shrug, he feigned indifference, his demeanor relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald blinked, clearly taken aback by Osborne's calmness. "You really aren't afraid of dying, are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled to himself. Of course, he was afraid of death, but with the Creation Herald's power, Osborne knew he wasn't in any real danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Oh, I'm terrified of dying! But if you want me to take a massive risk, you'd better offer something worth it. The forty-two divine peaks of Celestara are completely under your control, right? So for you, Miracle Elixirs and Celestial Crystals aren't worth much. Swapping some useless stuff for a chance to escape? That seems like a great deal for you! Think about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he closed his eyes, projecting an air of nonchalance as if to say, "Go ahead, I dare you to kill me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald's expression shifted as he was struggling between anger and contemplation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew those items had no real value for him; he could easily spare a million Miracle Elixirs and 10 billion Celestial Crystals without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the principle of being extorted by a mere fledgling that vexed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "You're doomed no matter what. Even if I give you these things, you won't live to use them! Fine, I'll hand them over to you now! And even if you somehow manage to survive, once I break free, I'll make sure to kill you myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After weighing his options, the Creation Herald made a choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Fine! I admire your guts! I'll honor your request. You'll get one million Miracle Elixirs, 10 billion Celestial Crystals, and a hundred super divine artifacts even stronger than the Supreme Sovereign's Armor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the Creation Herald finished speaking, Osborne couldn't help but break into a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned in and said, "I only need the yellow and blue Miracle Elixirs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald frowned at this. "Just the yellow and blue Miracle Elixirs? That's a bit tricky, but I can agree to it! Just make sure you handle things well; otherwise..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flash of danger gleamed in the Creation Herald's eyes, sending a shiver down Osborne's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with a calm smile, he reassured, "Don't worry. I'll do exactly as you ask!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go! Follow me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald lost patience for any more chatter and quickly led Osborne deep into the core of the Epochal Divine Peak. There, Osborne found himself face-to-face with an enormous human-shaped statue, entwined with massive tree roots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald snapped coldly, "This is just a projection!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My true form isn't here. But for now, my essence is indeed trapped by this damned tree! If it weren't for some special abilities, I would have been consumed long ago!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the Creation Herald entered a cave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hang tight while I gather your Miracle Elixirs and Celestial Crystals! As for super divine artifacts, what do you prefer? Do you need armor or weapons? Any elemental attributes or special requests? Just name it, and I'll do my best to accommodate you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Osborne felt a spark of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "What's gotten into him? Suddenly so generous? Is there a catch?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But whether there was a plot or not, he decided to make the most of the opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want fifty sets of armor and weapons! Everything: space elemental, dark elemental, lightning elemental, soul elemental, light elemental, life elemental, fire elemental, earth elemental, water elemental, and even pure power-based super divine artifacts... all of it! Just give me the best!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Creation Herald was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps he shouldn't have offered so freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he nodded, suppressing the need to protest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait here. I'll do my best to meet your requests, but if I come up short, don't blame me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he disappeared into the depths of the cavern, vanishing behind a shimmering barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, sensing the power of the barrier, tested it with his own strength, only to find it impenetrable. Even his Satan's Eye couldn't see through it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spatial power was completely nullified, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's inside? Is this the Creation Herald's treasure vault? He agreed to my demands so easily&mdash;most likely, his wealth is beyond imagination! If only I could clean him out..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a pounding urgency swell in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the Creation Herald reemerged, three Dimensional Bags in hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His piercing gaze locked onto Osborne's. "I'd advise you not to get any funny ideas about my treasure! There were two fools who tried to raid my vault before, and they nearly met their end because of it! One was called Lord Malevolence, and the other was the God of Night!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
