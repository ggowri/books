  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The time to reach Class A could vary, either being lengthy or brief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some individuals just sat for several months before finally attaining Class A, whereas others achieved it in just a few days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even if the period was short, it usually took more than seven days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's breakthrough was extremely swift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On just the first day, he had already extracted all his energy, blood, and strength from his muscles and cells. Once liberated from his body, they began to transform immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They condensed into a ball, initially no larger than a fist, invisible and intangible, emitting a faint blood-red light and occasional flashes of purple thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it gradually expanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the fist-sized energy and blood ball inflated to the size of a basketball. Simultaneously, Osborne could sense his energy and blood growing even more potent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, it didn't stop there and continued to expand, soon enveloping his desiccated body and eventually surging across the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For an average martial artist, when striving to become a Class A martial master, his energy and blood ball could swell five or ten times, but at most, it could only grow to the size of an adult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne's energy and blood ball actually expanded to the size of the entire room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was overjoyed, as it showed that his energy and blood were much stronger than that of ordinary martial artists at the same level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at the same time, he was worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The larger the energy and blood ball grew, the more challenging it became to undergo transformation and achieve a successful breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, his energy and blood ball was still expanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood-red light above was more and more brilliant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The purple lightning's brilliance flickered violently and turned dazzling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Osborne's energy and blood ball was large enough to cover the entire villa where he lived before halting. Fortunately, it was nighttime, and no one noticed these anomalies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If such an energy and blood ball can be transformed successfully, how terrifying will my body become? I might kill Brad with just one punch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but be stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being aware for quite some time that absorbing the power of the blood diamonds had changed his body, making him much stronger than martial artists of the same level, he hadn't anticipated the change to be so formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could such a massive energy and blood ball be transformed? Could it really be transformed successfully?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't die here, will I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As this thought crossed Osborne's mind, his energy and blood ball suddenly began to fluctuate violently, as if teetering on the brink of collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the energy and blood ball disintegrated, his life would end, and every trace of his existence in this world would vanish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything unfolded because Osborne's confidence started to falter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne swiftly stabilized his energy and blood ball, banishing all self-doubt. To achieve a breakthrough to Class A, he needed unwavering self-confidence. Any hesitation would immediately impact him, leading only to failure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, despite his repeated assurances that he could succeed and would not fail, the immense energy and blood ball continued to vibrate, as though it might collapse at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was indeed so enormous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had ever absorbed the power of blood diamonds into their body before, but Osborne had done it. Moreover, not long ago, his body underwent the baptism of the Blessing of Thunder...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body had long turned unusual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite possessing such a powerful and supernatural physique, he found himself constrained by conventional rules.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could transform such a huge energy and blood ball.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't do it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt that he could no longer stabilize the energy and blood ball. Before the transformation, it was about to collapse and dissipate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I really going to meet my doom?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Out of a hundred people who are striving for Class A, only one can succeed. How could I make it? I became a martial artist and really started to cultivate for just over a month!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those who have practiced for decades will even fail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could I possibly upgrade my level?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sensed his consciousness slowly fading, which was a clear sign that failure and death were imminent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he found himself dying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was going to meet his end!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, an idea suddenly occurred to his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pondered, "Others have to practice for decades to reach Class B+. How come I can reach this level in just over a month? Is it because of the blood diamonds or the Blessing of Thunder?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No! They are not the crucial factor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most important reason is the Breath of Celestial, which was given to me by Godfather!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes! The Breath of Celestial!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly thought of the Breath of Celestial, which had been the foundation of his martial arts journey, though he had nearly forgotten about it. Now, it came rushing back to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His dry body unconsciously practiced the Breath of Celestial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Exhale!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inhale!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, his energy and blood ball, on the verge of breaking down, stabilized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the enormous ball finally began to transform. It slowly compressed and changed, growing more condensed and more powerful.</span></p><div class="pagination">
