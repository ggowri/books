  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger's eyes darkened with a lethal glint as he stared down the enraged Stuart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Seriously? You charge at me before I even accept the challenge? Breaking the rules like that? You've pretty much signed your own death warrant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Time to pay the price!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With those words, a cold gleam flashed in Roger's eyes, and in a blink, he vanished. No one in the crowd could track his movements, not even those with enhanced sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was as if he'd disappeared into thin air, leaving behind no trace, no presence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart was left standing there, his panic growing by the second.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He spun around, desperately trying to locate Roger, but it was useless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This isn't good!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivian's face paled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stuart, you're playing right into his hands! He's baiting you into breaking the rules so he can kill you!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Get out of there!" she shouted, her voice filled with urgency.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A chilling voice whispered from behind Stuart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Too late!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was Roger, his figure ghostly and menacing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But what truly sent chills down everyone's spine was the dagger he held.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was a divine artifact, its blade glinting with deadly intent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unlike formal duels, the rules here were loose. Any weapon was fair game, even a divine artifact.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Earlier, Roger had been using an ancient magic weapon, but now he wielded something far more dangerous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, the dagger sliced through the air, aimed directly at Stuart's throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart, paralyzed with fear, couldn't move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His energy shields crumbled like paper under the dagger's power, offering no protection at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivian watched from below, her heart pounding in terror as the blade neared Stuart's neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he didn't move, he was as good as dead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart could feel the cold breath of death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But his body wouldn't respond as he was frozen in place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Both Stuart and Vivian screamed in horror, but it was too late. The dagger was already descending.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as the dagger was about to slice through Stuart's neck, the air around him suddenly rippled and distorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Space stretching!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's calm voice cut through the tension.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a flash, the space between Stuart and Roger stretched, pulling them apart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The dagger that was mere inches from Stuart's throat suddenly found itself a good distance away, slashing nothing but thin air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seizing the moment, Stuart bolted off the platform, his back drenched in cold sweat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger's expression darkened, his fury barely contained as he turned to glare at Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Spatial power, huh? Impressive, but saving him was a mistake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He broke the rules, and I had every right to end him. No one can stop me! By stepping in, you're basically asking to take his place, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne raised an eyebrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He hadn't intended to start a fight. His actions were purely instinctive. As a member of the Lambert family, it was natural to protect one of his own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Taking on Stuart's grudge wasn't something Osborne had planned on, though.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He spoke evenly, "He acted on impulse, out of anger. Let him apologize, and we can call it even. How about that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger responded with a cold, mocking laugh, "An apology? Like that matters to me. I want him dead for breaking the rules. If you're so eager to defend him, why don't you step up yourself?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't think you can just walk away. The rules here are set by all the major powers. If you defy them, the Lambert family will face the wrath of everyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And since you're from the Lambert family too, killing you works just as well for me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger's eyes gleamed with a dangerous edge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's frown deepened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was clear now that Roger had been baiting Stuart from the start.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But why? Did he have some kind of grudge against the Lambert family?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Lambert family had kept to themselves for centuries, avoiding external conflicts and staying out of the power struggles of the world. How could they have crossed someone like Roger?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perplexed, Osborne glanced at Stuart and Vivian. Stuart was still trembling with fear. Turning to Vivian, he asked, "Vivian, do we have any history with this guy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivian looked equally baffled and shook her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's impossible. We've been in seclusion for centuries, barely interacting with the outside world. The only one who might've had any dealings with him is Rhett.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's the only one who's been active outside recently."</p><div class="pagination">
