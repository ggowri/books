  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackie stated, his voice steady, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"According to the rules, once Osborne defeated the last challenger, Marlon, his Honor Quest Ceremony journey was officially over, and so was my role in it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What happens now is your personal stuff, and I can't get involved."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson's spirits plummeted at Jackie's words, his face paling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackie was his last hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As an elder of the Prophet Alliance, he was responsible for maintaining order during the Honor Quest Ceremony. If he intervened, even Rumen, a top-tier Class S powerhouse and the vice leader of the League of Divine Descent, wouldn't dare to overstep his bounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nobody could afford to offend the Prophet Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Jackie was announcing that the ceremony was over, choosing to step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That meant if Rumen decided to kill Osborne, he would turn a blind eye to it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen wore a sinister smile. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you hear that? The Honor Quest Ceremony is over! He may have defeated all challengers and become a legend, but he's still going to die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because your Augustine family is too weak to protect someone like him! The fact that he was born into the Augustine family is his greatest misfortune!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, I'm going to kill him. Who's going to stop me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Rumen took deliberate steps toward Osborne, his murderous intent boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson was drenched in sweat, despair etched across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, Osborne stepped forward, standing in front of Wesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression was equally grave as he faced Rumen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew all too well that, at his current strength, he stood no chance against Rumen</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>not even if he had ten times his own power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Sebastian absent, no one from the Augustine family could stop Rumen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne also understood that begging for mercy wouldn't save him; Rumen wouldn't spare him, no matter how low he stooped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Rumen wanted a fight, then a fight he would have!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said coldly,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rumen, you want to kill me? You better be ready for it! And by the way, I don't think the Honor Quest Ceremony is over just yet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Osborne's declaration, Rumen faltered, momentarily taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackie raised an eyebrow, intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, while I admire your spirit and don't want to see you dead, the Prophet Alliance never gets involved in the conflicts between major powers. If he had attacked you during the Honor Quest Ceremony, I would have stepped in. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But right now, it's clear the ceremony has concluded, and I can't intervene."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen's laughter echoed through the tension-filled air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you hear that? Mr. Flores just said the Honor Quest Ceremony is over. You still want to struggle? No one is going to save you today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scoffed, ignoring Rumen's taunts. Instead, he turned to Jackie. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Flores, my Honor Quest Ceremony isn't over yet! There's still one challenger who hasn't stepped up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackie's eyes widened in surprise. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you talking about? Cuthbert? He can't be here in your Honor Quest Ceremony anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cuthbert was the only one ranked higher than Marlon in the Godson Rankings among the younger generation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Cuthbert was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a fact known only to a select few, as the Williamson family had locked the news. However, the Prophet Alliance had foreseen this outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackie knew Cuthbert wouldn't be showing up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought Osborne was trying to use Cuthbert's absence as an excuse to argue that the Honor Quest Ceremony wasn't truly over, hoping to get him to step in against Rumen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but shake his head, a look of pity crossing his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not Cuthbert!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not Cuthbert? Then who? He's the only one ranked higher than Marlon in the Godson Rankings! Osborne, don't be ridiculous! I told you, the Honor Quest Ceremony is over, and I can't help you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackie was a little pissed off and scolded Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Jackie finished his reprimand, a chilling scoff echoed through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who says the Honor Quest Ceremony is over?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I haven't even made my move yet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice sent a ripple of surprise across everyone's faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne felt a glimmer of joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned eagerly toward the source of the voice, a hopeful smile lighting up his features. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You finally made it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The newcomer was none other than Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dressed in a simple athletic outfit that showcased her perfect figure, her long hair tied into two playful ponytails, she radiated youthful energy as she confidently strode onto the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I promised I'd be here for your Honor Quest Ceremony, and here I am."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, her gaze turned icy as she fixed her eyes on Jackie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You say the Honor Quest Ceremony is over? How dare you scold Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackie was rendered speechless, his eyes wide in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Isa spoke, beads of sweat broke on Jackie</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s forehead, and he felt a tremor run through his body, panic washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa said coldly, "Tell me, is the Honor Quest Ceremony over?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a response, Jackie quickly greeted her in respect. "No! It's not over!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
