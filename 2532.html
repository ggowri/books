  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Still can't do it?" Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Satan's Eye suddenly throbbed violently, issuing a danger warning. Without any hesitation, Osborne immediately used spatial power to evade.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A terrifying tentacle suddenly pierced through the spot where Osborne had been standing. If not for Satan's Eye's warning, Osborne would have been impaled by the tentacle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dalia's tentacles are incredibly terrifying. Once touched by them, regardless of whether one's cultivation level is at advanced Empyrean Sacredness or has reached Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, they will immediately lose all ability to resist, only to have their vital essence and soul power swiftly drained by Dalia's tentacles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne knew very well that he absolutely couldn't withstand it either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But fortunately, he dodged it this time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he dodged it this time, the situation was still dangerous. Hundreds of tentacles grew from Dalia's body. Unless he could break through the Phantomagic Realm and escape, sooner or later, he would be caught by Dalia's tentacles and eventually drained dry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dalia is too powerful! If those twenty-something Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warriors were still alive, maybe they could have held her off! Unfortunately, they were drained by Dalia right from the start, which only made her even stronger..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone here combined is no match for Dalia."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit desperate at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt that his strength was ultimately too weak!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During this time, Osborne relied on his Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King cultivation level to defeat numerous warriors, even instantly killing an Illusionary Heavenly Demon with an Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection cultivation level using Heaven Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had to admit that he had indeed become a bit too complacent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt that his current cultivation level had already reached a very high stage, allowing him to contend with, and even gain the upper hand against, those with an Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection cultivation level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was only at this moment that Osborne finally realized his strength was still too weak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In front of Dalia, he could do nothing, not even escape.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"These people are beyond saving!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Primordial appeared on Osborne's shoulder. "Forget about them, hide quickly, or you'll die here too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne bit his lip.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, hundreds of thousands entered the Phantomagic Realm, all warriors with cultivation levels reaching Empyrean Sacredness. Although some died during the fight for the Dragon Elixir, most of them were still alive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, they were all going to die at Dalia's hands.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't save them!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He's no saint either; he knew the best choice now was to hide immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and summoned Drum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum was Osborne's lifeline, his final trump card!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Due to Drum's unique form, no one could see or harm it. Osborne just needed to hide in Drum's Dimensional Microcosm, and he wouldn't have to worry about Dalia's attacks anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He only needed to stay in the Dimensional Microcosm and wait for the Phantomagic Realm to completely disappear, and by then, Adriana would surely take action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for saving others, he was truly powerless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head and stopped overthinking. He wasn't the one who killed these people, so there was no need to feel guilty. Surviving in such a situation was already hard enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Before leaving, I must get the remaining nine Bewitching Lanterns!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne clenched his teeth and looked at Dalia.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Around Dalia, there were still nine Bewitching Lanterns, emitting a pink glow. The nine Bewitching Lanterns that Osborne couldn't find earlier were actually on Dalia.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne decided to get all the Bewitching Lanterns before hiding.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, these Bewitching Lanterns had absorbed the power of the entire Phantomagic Realm. As long as all ninety-nine Bewitching Lanterns could be gathered and fused together, they would have a great chance to transform into an Imperial Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Missing even one Bewitching Lantern could lead to failure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Warfare Ancient Tree!" Osborne shouted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To seize the Bewitching Lantern, only the Warfare Ancient Tree could act. Only the Warfare Ancient Tree could suppress the power of the Bewitching Lantern and snatch it from Dalia's hands.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Warfare Ancient Tree did not disappoint Osborne this time either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Beside Dalia, the branches of the Warfare Ancient Tree suddenly emerged from the void, entangling the nine Bewitching Lanterns and swiftly dragging them back into the void.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Dalia became even more furious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That damn tree again! Trying to take all my Bewitching Lanterns? No way!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, dozens of Dalia's tentacles swiftly stabbed toward the branches of the Warfare Ancient Tree, trying to snatch back the nine Bewitching Lanterns.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the tentacles pierced into the void, directly impaling the branches of the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Osborne felt the Warfare Ancient Tree trembling violently. Fortunately, at the critical moment, a powerful force surged from the branches of the Warfare Ancient Tree, directly flinging Dalia's tentacles away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, those branches completely disappeared, taking the nine Bewitching Lanterns back to Osborne's Soul Current Ocean, hanging them on its branches.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Success!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was thrilled. The process just now was so perilous that he almost thought the Warfare Ancient Tree wouldn't make it back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, they succeeded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Dalia stared at the last nine disappearing Bewitching Lanterns, her gaze terrifying. Her body trembled violently with rage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're dead!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She roared furiously but couldn't locate the Warfare Ancient Tree at all, so she could only fix her gaze on the panicked and terrified crowd around her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I won't let you go! I will find you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Dalia's tentacles moved even faster, piercing through the bodies of warriors one by one, unleashing an incredibly horrifying massacre.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's Satan's Eye issued another warning, allowing him to narrowly evade yet another attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Dalia suddenly looked at Osborne, her face showing surprise and murderous intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She noticed Osborne!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne actually dodged her tentacle attacks twice, which she found unbelievable. Even warriors with a cultivation level of Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection couldn't evade her tentacle attacks, yet Osborne managed to dodge twice.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought to herself, "This person is no ordinary fighter!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Perhaps he's the one who stole my Bewitching Lantern!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Dalia controlled more tentacles to attack Osborne from all directions, aiming to take him down first.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's Satan's Eye was pulsating wildly at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dammit, I've been discovered!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Run!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately had Drum open the Dimensional Microcosm, slipped inside, and vanished from the spot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the moment Osborne disappeared, dozens of terrifying tentacles pierced through where he had been, but unfortunately, they all missed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had already hidden inside Drum's Dimensional Microcosm and vanished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation left Dalia stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She carefully tried to sense something but felt nothing. Instantly, her face darkened, and her expression grew even more terrifying!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it! You can't escape! I don't care where you're hiding. Once I drain all these people and my cultivation level reaches Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, I will kill you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Dalia resumed her slaughter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The hundreds of thousands in the Phantomagic Realm were swiftly killed and drained by her tentacles, like cutting wheat, with no one able to resist them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the Phantomagic Realm was like hell.</span></p><div class="pagination">
