  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Hannah was held back by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hannah, hold on! Your level is too low. Rushing in won't save anyone. Do you really think you're stronger than your grandfather?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah was desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know I can't match Alfred, but can I just stand here and watch him kill my grandfather? I can't do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne tried to calm her, saying, "We're still here, aren't we?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trust me, a Deity King warrior's vitality is incredibly strong. Alfred might defeat your grandfather, but killing him won't be easy. I'll take care of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne turned to the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who among you is confident enough to defeat Alfred?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group exchanged uneasy glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce spoke up, "Osborne, if Alfred didn't have the Supreme Malevolence Sword and Supreme Malevolence Shield, we'd all be confident in defeating him. Even if he just lacked the shield, we'd have a good shot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But he's got two Ultimate divine artifacts</span><span>, </span><span>one for offense and one for defense. Our gear can't compare, and it's just too hard to beat him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce's words were met with nods from Kendra, Mila, and Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They clearly felt the same way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Anastasia remained calm. When Osborne looked at her, she smiled, "I'll give it a try!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia replied, "Don't worry, Osborne. I'll be careful. If it doesn't work out, there's always you, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a laugh, she turned her gaze to Alfred, a faint glint of battle intent in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's figure blurred as he moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Alfred had already taken complete control of the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred's Supreme Malevolence Sword continuously inflicted wounds on Raoul, severely damaging his Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If not for the robust life force of a Deity King warrior, Raoul would have died long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he couldn't hold on much longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha! Old fool, how does it feel? I'm done playing. Time to send you to the grave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred raised the Supreme Malevolence Sword high, a massive surge of divine power filling it. A terrifying sword beam shot out, aimed straight at Raoul's vital spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair filled Raoul's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't block it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his current state, he had no chance of defending against Alfred's attack. If that sword hit, he would either die or be critically injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raoul mused, "The Mystic Feather Clan in Wild Flame City is done for!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least the Gellar family has already entered Hannah's Dimensional Microcosm. Even if I die, we can still carry on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hope nothing happens to Hannah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raoul's thoughts were bleak, and he had given up on his defenses, waiting for death to come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Alfred's terrifying sword beam was about to hit Raoul, something unexpected happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several young figures suddenly appeared before Raoul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them, a woman, faced Alfred's deadly strike and quickly pointed a finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A blinding bolt of lightning shot out, smashing into Alfred's sword beam and instantly shattering it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's vision momentarily blurred, and it took a moment for their sight to return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then they saw Alfred stumbling backward, lightning still crackling around him. His face turned extremely grim, and he glared angrily at the woman who had intervened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Anastasia!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, are you alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah, with a worried look, quickly helped the heavily wounded Raoul to his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raoul was stunned and then grew more anxious when he saw Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hannah, why did you come back? Why did you do this? You're such a fool! Why did you come back to die? What about the Gellar family? What are we supposed to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raoul's anxiety was so overwhelming that he spat out a mouthful of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Hannah became even more tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Grandpa, don't talk! Your injuries are severe! Don't worry; the Gellar family will be fine! I'm also part of the Wild Flame City's Mystic Feather Clan. How </span><span>could I run away when the clan is facing this disaster?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, one of the reasons they're attacking us is because they claim I killed Tobey! I brought this disaster upon the Mystic Feather Clan, and I can't just run away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's words left Raoul pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stupid girl! That's just their excuse! It's not your fault, and you shouldn't have come back! You shouldn't have come back to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raoul's eyes were brimming with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the tension could escalate further, Osborne spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not a death sentence. You should focus on healing. We'll handle the rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the words, Raoul glanced at Osborne and asked, "Who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had transformed into a younger version of his father, Theodore, which was why Raoul didn't recognize him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "My name is Theodore Augustine. I'm a friend of Hannah's. Hannah, take good care of your grandfather."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne turned his attention to Alfred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Alfred's cold eyes were fixed on Anastasia, a terrifying killing intent boiling within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you? You actually dared to stop me from killing that old fool? You're asking for death!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
