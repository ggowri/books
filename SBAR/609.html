Eric looked at Jeff with deep eyes, thinking, "He's really a bastard, misleading Mom from the start."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff's gaze shifted, not daring to say that Queenie was his biological daughter, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Paula had found out about this, he would have lost everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula would rather destroy everything than let him get away with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His reputation was already bad enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff's eyes were cold. "Don't you also love Queenie? If even I don't want her anymore, what will she do? She's my daughter, who I've raised since childhood. I can't bear to let her go. The five of you are already grown up, not as sensitive as her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric smiled bitterly, "Yes, even though you abandoned us, you are still our father."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff knew he was in the wrong and didn't dare to say much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned and said, "Let's go, we'll go back first. I'll have your grandmother come and cause a scene again. Diana will surely obediently hand over the money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric's eyes were filled with a cold light, thinking, "This mongrel actually still refuses to give up on manipulating Diana."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered, "There really isn't anyone more shameless than you in this world. You never raised Diana for a single day, yet you want to snatch her company?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff frowned at him and laughed, "Eric, you've changed. Weren't you the one who hated Diana the most before? You wished to take everything from her and give it to Queenie. Don't forget, Queenie is the sister who grew up with you all. Although Diana has a blood relation with you, she's ultimately not that close to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric smiled and said sarcastically, "I suddenly realized that whether or not we have a blood relation with you, in your eyes, Queenie is the most important."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've given up your own children, so ever since you signed the parent-child relationship termination document, we are unrelated. Diana said you have a chronic illness, so I hope that on the day your condition worsens, your beloved Queenie will take good care of you as if you were her biological father."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was taken aback and angry, "You brat, what are you talking about? I gave up on you because I couldn't afford to raise you. You are all adults now, with your own lives. Even if I chose you, could you follow me and live together?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric looked at Jeff's hypocritical appearance and just wanted to laugh. "Jeff, you will not only regret it but also face retribution. You abandoned my mother and us, and I hope you can bear such retribution."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric left after speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was so angry that his chest felt tight. He took a deep breath, thinking, "Why did Diana say I have a chronic illness?</span><span> </span><span>This damn girl is simply talking nonsense.</span><span> </span><span>What's wrong with me? Other than having high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol... No, I might also get Alzheimer's disease."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! I'm so young. How could I get such an illness?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I must take good care of my health."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff didn't get any money today. His eyes were full of calculations, but he didn't know that being good at calculating would eventually lead him to have nothing, while he thought Diana, the country girl from a poor background, would end up being the wealthiest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I won't let Diana have a good day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was plotting in his mind, planning to have Trac</span><span>e</span><span>y create a scene again tomorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Diana had evidence. He couldn't be aggressive, so he could only strike secretly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took out his phone and called Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, Dad, what's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, Diana refuses to give the money. Do you have any good ideas?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="608.html">« Prev</a><a href="610.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
