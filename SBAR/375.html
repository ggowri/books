The Marsh family treats me so well. Paige, I know you like Frank, but you can't marry him. You can slander me, but you can't ruin Frank's wedding. A vicious woman like you doesn't deserve happiness."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie looked at Paige with a provocative smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wanted to guide public opinion to smooth the incident, but no one around her echoed. Her provocative smile was so embarrassing as this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige looked at Queenie provocatively and sneered, "Do you think every woman in the world likes Frank?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I had long abandoned him. It's his business whoever he wants to marry, but I must take avenge today. Do you understand?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You can say whatever you want. Anyway, you're always barking like this. Only the people in the Marsh family think you're a good girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, including Mr. Gellar behind you, your loyal simp. I wonder if he will still dote on you after he knows all the shameless things you have done."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was the first time Paige had been so sharp-tongued in public.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven frowned, looked at Paige coldly, and warned, "Paige, watch your mouth."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was angry, but what Paige said was true.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was not a secret that Steven doted on Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because of Steven's indifference towards Diana, many people disdained Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige sneered, "I have been polite enough. I hope you and Queenie, two bastards, to be together forever and not come out to disgust others."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's face turned livid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana quickly pulled Paige and said, "Paige, stop talking. Steven is vindictive. Be careful that he might take revenge on your family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was afraid that Steven would do something bad to Paige.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana knew that Steven would really do something to those who had offended him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige stopped speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank looked lifeless and finally came back to his senses. Looking at the disgusting pictures on the big screen, he felt so sick. He didn't expect the woman he had been pursuing for a year to be so lewd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie had a child and three husbands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank finally understood what Paige meant when she said, "She has been married for the third time. Why should I attend your wedding?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank looked at Elsie with cold eyes. "Elsie, it turns out that you have been lying to me all the time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie hadn't gotten the money from Frank, so she would not give up easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She shook her head, crying and explaining, "Frank, this is all Paige's revenge on you. Don't believe her. She loves you too much. Seeing you marry me, she is taking revenge on us like this. She doesn't want us to be happy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank looked at Paige. "Paige, is it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige looked at his foolish expression and regretted that she had liked him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She said with a meaningful smile, "Frank, believe it or not. Anyway, I have already taken revenge. As for whom you believe in, it has nothing to do with me. As long as it makes you feel better, you can believe Elsie."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank clenched his fists tightly and looked at Paige. Her eyes were cold, without a trace of love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Those frame-ups were all done by Elsie, and he had never believed Paige.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since junior high school, Paige had brought Frank breakfast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Frank was sick, Paige would gently coax him to take medicine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had said many times that Elsie was not a good woman and that he would not be happy with Elsie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Frank thought Paige was jealous of Elsie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he saw the truth, he was scared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank looked depressed and listless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Frank like this, Elsie knew that he had believed what Paige said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie said, "Frank, please don't believe Paige. She had really framed me before. These videos are all fake. You..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before she could finish speaking, a cold voice came from the entrance of the venue. "Elsie, you said these videos are all fake. What about me?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="374.html">« Prev</a><a href="376.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
