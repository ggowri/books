Please, don't let me down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "This daughter of mine... I really hope she doesn't disappoint me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can't afford to make a wrong bet. Paula truly loves me; letting her go is tearing me apart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smiled brightly, trying to ease the tension. "Dad, don't overthink it. You're divorced now. Pick a good day to marry Mom and throw a grand wedding. But let's not rush into it; we can plan for spring next year. For now, just go back and spend some time with Mom. I have things to take care of."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she turned and walked away, leaving Jeff feeling a heavy weight in his chest, as if he had lost something irreplaceable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news of Jeff filing for divorce just after Paula's company went bankrupt exploded online in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People who knew Jeff couldn't hold back their opinions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jeff was always a nobody. He married Paula for her family's wealth, and now that the Barnes family is in ruins, he's bailing out. Typical."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you even know the whole story? I heard Paula got played, and her company was bought out for a song. The person who acquired it hasn't even shown their face yet. I suspect Jeff colluded with outsiders to siphon off his wife's assets."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jeff's terrified of being labeled as a man living off his wife's success. It's true, but he can't admit it. Paula must have hit the jackpot in bad luck to end up with such a heartless jerk."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me throw some fuel on the fire&mdash;rumor has it, Jeff ditched all four of his sons just to get this divorce and cut ties with them, taking only his adopted daughter with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, he only took his adopted daughter? I wonder if there's something shady going on there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I bet they teamed up to snatch everything away from Paula."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got a juicy tidbit&mdash;at Sir Foliot's gala, Jeff was seen with another woman. Can you believe it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The comments kept pouring in, each more scathing than the last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back at Amelie's house, Jeff seethed as he scrolled through the online backlash, his anger boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He threw his phone across the room in frustration. "What the hell are these idiots talking about? Queenie is my biological daughter; why do they have to make wild assumptions?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie, trying to calm him down, said, "Look, you're divorced now. These people are just looking for drama; they're not worth your energy. Don't let their nonsense get to you. Your health is already fragile. Besides, you still have that branch office to keep us afloat, and that's enough for now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gently urged him to sit down and poured him a glass of water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff slumped onto the couch, breathing heavily, clutching his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "I just got divorced, and now this mess? Who's going to want to do business with me now? The internet is already tearing me apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each comment stings worse than the last. I know I messed up, but when a couple is in crisis, they look out for themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She owes so much money; how am I supposed to pay that off?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell leaked my divorce news?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff fumed, stomping his feet in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie watched him, her expression a mix of disbelief and irritation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "He's about to hit rock bottom. Jeff is practically useless now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he's broke, what's the point of being with him?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="575.html">« Prev</a><a href="577.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
