Jeff was not new to blaming others for his own mistakes. He had done this before with Queenie to hurt Diana.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought, "Wait, he always targeted Diana. Did he know the secret? Is that why he abandoned Diana? But how could he possibly know?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula was full of anger. She looked at Jeff, who showed no sign of guilt. "Jeff, I work hard every day for the company, and you flirt with another woman in public. Everyone saw it, and you blame me for being jealous? Why don't you talk about how much money your company lost last year and how I covered for you?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff wanted to look good, but Paula wanted to expose him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff was embarrassed when he heard this.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Paula, you can't say it like that. We are family," he stammered.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula sneered, "Jeff, you didn't say we were family when you were flirting with that woman or when you were in bed with her. I caught you cheating before, and now you're drinking with her again. I don't believe nothing is going on between you two."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula didn't care about saving face anymore. She had been careful with every step, but now she didn't need to hold back.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff was shocked and saw people around them whispering.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He cared about his reputation and had always been seen as a good husband. Paula's words ruined that image.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He tried to explain with a smile, "Paula, the last time was a misunderstanding. Diana set me up."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana interrupted him, "Mr. Marsh, at Jace's banquet, you went into that room yourself. Why do you keep blaming me?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana had to speak up when she heard Jeff accusing her again.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula saw Diana and had tears in her eyes.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Diana didn't look at her. "Mr. Marsh, you keep blaming me. This time, maybe I should call the police."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff was furious. "You little brat, why are you always around? Get out of here!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana stood her ground. The one to get lost was him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From that day onward, she would not hold back anymore.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She would never let them hurt her again.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She said, "I'm sorry, but you keep blaming me and even said on a live broadcast that I framed Queenie. Since you and your daughter are so heartless, I will tell everyone about your dirty secrets. And what about the woman behind you? Are you sure there's nothing between you two?" Diana looked at Jeff with disgust.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff was shocked and scared. "Diana, this is my family matter. It has nothing to do with you."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It may be your family matter, but why do you keep blaming me? You cheated, and you say I set you up. The surveillance video clearly shows that you weren't drunk or drugged. You went into that room yourself. Why do you blame me?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana took out her phone and called the police.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wouldn't show any mercy to Jeff.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She spoke into the phone. "911? Yes, someone keeps blaming me and even said on a live broadcast that I framed his daughter. But I never did such a thing. In fact, they are the ones who keep hurting me. I have evidence, and I want to report this. Please help."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana gave the hotel's address and hung up the phone.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff was about to lose it. "Diana, you little bastard. How dare you call the police on me?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana frowned.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Little bastard? What does he mean by that?</p><div class="pagination"><a href="329.html">« Prev</a><a href="331.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
