"What&rsquo;s he done this time?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That utterly foolish man disgusted her to no end. Dylan was exactly the type she despised most&mdash;arrogant, and completely devoid of any substance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick handed his phone to Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glanced at the news and found it utterly ridiculous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He </span><span>runs to the cops in the middle of the night saying his mom&rsquo;s missing,</span><span> then turns around and </span><span>throws me under the bus</span><span> in front of the media. That idiot</span><span>, totally</span><span> beyond </span><span>help</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>He may not know</span><span> the truth, a lot of people online can see what&rsquo;s really going on now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana handed the phone back to Nick. "Typical Dylan. Just as selfish as Jeff. If he loves performing so much, let him put on a real show."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick frowned deeply. "Diana, if you don&rsquo;t </span><span>shut this down fast</span><span>, our company&rsquo;s reputation will take a serious hit. People are already calling for a boycott of the Gellar Group."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He </span><span>was seconds away from storming out and strangling that bastard himself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana let out a cold laugh. "</span><span>Relax</span><span>. Let&rsquo;s wait and see. If Queenie dared to push him into this mess, she&rsquo;s definitely holding something back.</span><span> And I wanna know </span><span>what</span><span> it is.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick asked, "Diana, you really going to let this spread? </span><span>They&rsquo;re dragging you all over the internet</span><span> right now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He clenched his fists tightly at his sides</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">N</span><span style="font-style: italic;">ot a single decent person in the Marsh family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing him so furious, Diana actually smiled. "Don&rsquo;t waste your anger on </span><span>trash</span><span>. </span><span>N</span><span>ot worth it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We</span><span>&rsquo;ll get him</span><span>, just not yet. Since Dylan loves playing the victim so much, let him </span><span>run the whole act.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>H</span><span>e&rsquo;s running out of </span><span>time anyway</span><span>. People like him, once they lose their value, </span><span>they&rsquo;re done</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other three Marsh </span><span>brothers </span><span>might have a shred of humanity left, but Dylan is selfish to the core&mdash;just like Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick took a deep breath, barely managing to suppress the anger boiling inside him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as they sat down, Evan suddenly showed up. The moment Luna saw him, her eyes turned red instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Evan, you bastard! Where the hell did you come from? I thought you were dead." Luna kept cursing, but no matter how hard she tried, she couldn&rsquo;t hide the joy in her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan looked at her, and for a second, his tough exterior cracked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>H</span><span>e</span><span> strode forward and pulled her tightly into his arms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone present was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan held Luna close, his eyes filled with happiness. "Luna, don&rsquo;t be sad. See? I&rsquo;m right here, aren&rsquo;t I?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Luna, I missed you so much."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his last words, Luna finally snapped back to her senses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She quickly pulled herself out of his arms, her face turning bright red. "Evan, what are you talking about?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, I&rsquo;m talking nonsense. Just please stop crying. You&rsquo;re breaking my heart," Evan said softly, completely ignoring everyone else.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna finally broke into a smile through her tears</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What could make me happier than </span><span style="font-style: italic;">this</span><span style="font-style: italic;">?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, you're alive, and that's all that matters. Now sit down and eat."</span><span> </span><span>She hurried to the kitchen, quickly making another plate of pasta.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana took in the scene, a soft sigh escaping her thoughts, "They&rsquo;re so lucky."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After sitting down, Evan recounted in detail everything that had happened at the hospital that night.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though Diana had already heard it once from Steven, she still felt a chill run down her spine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick's eyes widened in shock. "Queenie is absolutely insane! How can </span><span>she</span><span> so vicious still exist in this world?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan gritted his teeth. "You're </span><span>damn right about her cruelty. That's why I sleep with one eye open.</span><span> </span><span>Without our preparations that night, old man Gellar would be six feet under.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glance</span><span>d</span><span> at Steven, who had remained silent the whole time. Perhaps </span><span>he</span><span> never imagined he'd fall victim to such a scheme.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie and George had struck without warning. No declarations. Just knives in the dark.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's eat first," Diana broke the silence. "We've got a tough battle ahead later."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven quietly placed a steak on Diana's plate. "Diana, eat more. You've lost weight lately."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had indeed lost a lot of weight. She'd been so busy lately that she barely had time for her favorite little cakes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She smiled, "</span><span>Relax</span><span>. But honestly, I</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>m </span><span>even more stunning now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her words made everyone laugh, and the tension at the table eased. After breakfast, they immediately held a meeting </span><span>for</span><span> their next </span><span>moves</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Queenie and George were elegantly enjoying their breakfast.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie scrolled the hateful comments about Diana on her phone. </span><span>Each new #BoycottGellar tweet plumped her lips with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, they would have a huge opportunity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked up at George across the table, "Check </span><span>in </span><span>with Andrew. If everything's set, we'll have Lillian secure those new projects. </span><span>That should keep the cash flowing through the rest of the year.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lillian's hypnosis tricks </span><span>worked like magic&mdash;stealing deals right from under people&rsquo;s noses.</span><span> To her, it was the perfect </span><span>weapon.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clean. Quiet. Untraceable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Too bad </span><span>Cecil </span><span>had </span><span>narrowly escaped that night.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George had no idea what </span><span>Andrew </span><span>was planning either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He shook his head and said, "</span><span>He</span><span> hasn&rsquo;t called yet. </span><span>J</span><span>ust told me to wait for the right moment. </span><span>No updates since.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A cold glint of murderous intent flickered in Queenie's eyes</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Andrew.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The name alone made </span><span style="font-style: italic;">my</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> stomach turn.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought she&rsquo;d forgotten. </span><span>But she didn</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>t.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">You drugged me. Raped me. You disgusting old man&mdash;I&rsquo;ll make sure you regret breathing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once </span><span>Queenie</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s</span><span> done </span><span>with</span><span> him, </span><span>she</span><span>&rsquo;ll find a chance to kill him. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George said, "Keep smear</span><span>ing</span><span> Diana. I</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>ll </span><span>take back the Gellar Group. </span><span>E</span><span>ven if I have to burn it to the ground.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie snapped back, "No! You can&rsquo;t destroy it. The Gellar Group&rsquo;s biotech company is in a growth phase. If we </span><span>take it, we own the future.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie had already planned out exactly how to run the Gellar Group.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the ambitious in her eyes, George felt a sense of relief. "Alright. I&rsquo;ll do as you say. They say </span><span>behind every great man is a woman</span><span>. Queenie, let&rsquo;s get engaged. I </span><span>mean it</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gazed at her with heartfelt affection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over the years, </span><span>only </span><span>Queenie genuinely stood by his side, while every other woman only came to him for his money.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George was well aware of how good Queenie had been to him all these years.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie thought about their decade-long entanglement&mdash;it was time for it to finally have a conclusion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright." She smiled at him and said, "George, finally </span><span>giving</span><span> me a title</span><span>?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Steven is gone. This is the next best thing. A shadow is still better than nothing.</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing her agree, George said joyfully, "Once we </span><span>take Diana down</span><span>, we&rsquo;ll announce our engagement. </span><span>U</span><span>se it to boost the company. </span><span>Any idea about it</span><span>?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1055.html">« Prev</a><a href="1057.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
