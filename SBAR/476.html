No one would make joke about someone's life. "Mr. Gellar, you didn't let me mention Ms. Bishop in front of you, so I didn't say that the person I was going to see was her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When she just got off the viaduct, she was hit by Samuel's car. Samuel seemed to have done it on purpose. If Ms. Bishop hadn't reacted quickly, she would be dead now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned. "Diana didn't lie to me. She really had a car accident."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan didn't speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven felt guilty. He thought, "If I had not driven her out of the car, she would not have been in a car accident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what she said really angered me. She is still my wife, but she dared to date another man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven ordered coldly, "Go to the hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was stunned. He wanted to say that Diana probably didn't want to see Steven, but he dared not say it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had one last bottle of IV drip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom brought sumptuous food to Diana and Joseph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom smiled, "Diana, I'll have dinner with you here. You're usually too busy, so it's hard for me to treat you to a meal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana chuckled, "Great. Tonight, I have two handsome men having dinner with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven happened to hear this when he arrived at the ward door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The anger that he had just suppressed with great difficulty rose up again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven cursed in his mind, "Damn it! How dare she have dinner with two men?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven immediately turned around and left. There were many people here to accompany Diana, and she didn't need him at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was helpless. He handed the fruit to the nurse and left with Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere in the ward was warm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled and said to Tom, "You are so devoted to the patients that you rarely have time to eat with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom smiled, "Well, it's because I'm not as smart as you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Tom looked at Joseph and said, "Joseph, study hard in college. Diana is excellent. She skipped grades to complete all her studies. When others were busy with the examinations, she had already completed all her studies. She even completed her postgraduate studies in only two years. She is so talented."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay!" Joseph nodded and looked at Diana with envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom looked at Diana and joked, "Diana, if the Marsh family knew that you had such great talent, would they regret abandoning you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said calmly, "Tom, do you think the people who hope me die will regret it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tsk, you asked for it. If you hadn't fallen in love with Steven one-sidedly, who could have hurt you?" Tom pushed the oatmeal in front of Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said with a bitter smile, "I've returned to the right path. I won't love him in this life. I'll just focus on my career in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom nodded. "That's right. With your talent and academic achievements, you have a bright future. It's not worth it to waste three years of your life for a scumbag."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled, "Yeah, you are right."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="475.html">« Prev</a><a href="477.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
