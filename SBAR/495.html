Her face was pure and striking. It's far more beautiful than any celebrity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at him, his arrogance unchanged, then calmly turned to the police. "Hello, I'm here to submit new evidence. Two weeks ago, Samuel planned how to kill me quietly. He researched various methods and ultimately chose brake failure. If I were to die, it would just seem like an accident. It's merely a matter of compensation, letting him avoid legal consequences. These are all the pieces of evidence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel was stunned by her words, his long legs suddenly ceasing their restless movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, what nonsense are you spouting? When did I ever plan to kill you? And where did you get that evidence..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana cut him off coldly. "Samuel, why so worked up? Congratulations, you've become someone else's perfect weapon. You'll be in prison while the real culprit stays free."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel clenched his fists tightly, glaring fiercely at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How dare she submit new evidence?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What did she mean by what she said?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Didn't Queenie say that Diana was a nobody, a true fool who didn't even finish high school?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, Queenie was beautiful, a noblewoman, talented, and gentle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, when Diana claimed to have new evidence, it genuinely shocked him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared blankly at Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She handed all the evidence to the police.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then looked at the officer, her gaze serious. "Sir, I live-streamed the entire process. I demand a fair and just result."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you dream of sending me to prison? I do want to kill you, so you'd better pray I stay in there for long. If I get out, I'll make your death even more miserable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Smack..." Diana stood up and slapped him hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sneered but remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring this madman would drive him even crazier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man seemed to have rage issues, unable to control his temper. He was even more stubborn than Cecil. If he decided to help someone, he would do so with an almost pathological obsession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Queenie couldn't get Cecil's help, she settled for Samuel instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie understood Samuel's nature well; he was a useful weapon, a sharp blade to wield against Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only difference was that Samuel lacked Cecil's intelligence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Cecil were to do something like this, he'd never leave evidence behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's brilliance concealed her vicious acts; even if someone glimpsed her true nature, they wouldn't suspect anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Samuel, you're this arrogant even here. I bet the people you've killed suffered terribly, didn't they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel was stunned, unable to believe Diana had dared to hit him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You hit me," Samuel said, shocked, his voice sounding off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sneered. "Yes, I hit you. Should I be serving tea and treating you kindly, considering you want to kill me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people in the livestream were speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't Ms. Bishop kind of adorable?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honestly, she's really beautiful. And honestly, Samuel is so arrogant. He was at my school and had countless women. Many even committed suicide over him. Having money sure is nice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, but having money doesn't mean you can act like this. He's finally getting what he deserves. People like him should be locked up forever, not released to harm others again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana deliberately showed Samuel the comments from the live stream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Samuel, enraged, his eyes bloodshot, roared, "Diana, I'll kill you!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="494.html">« Prev</a><a href="496.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
