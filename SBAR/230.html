Your plan has failed again. Go comfort your childhood sweetheart. Knowing I'm safely out of the police station, she'll be crying out for comfort again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's face was cold and gloomy. He looked at Diana and asked, "Diana, what are you talking about? I am worried about you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana said, "You must be worried about me coming out. I'm sorry your scheme to set me up failed again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven, do you remember what I said that night? I said I would never tolerate it again. If you have forgotten, I will always remind you. You set me up, and I will fight back." Diana's good mood vanished when she saw Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you hate me so much?" Steven stared at her. The hatred in her eyes was obvious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana sneered, looking at the bright sunshine in the morning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She took a deep breath before looking at him. "Steven, now I feel that my previous perception of you was wrong. It is unfair to say that you are a scumbag. I was wrong to say you like to frame people and play emotional games. My suggestion that you don't know friendship from love is even more ridiculous. Now I finally understand that you are selfish. You only love yourself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't say that I misunderstood. You have plotted against me many times. And I will fight back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finished speaking, Diana left. And Steven moved to block her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can explain that I have never participated in this matter." Steven said in a low voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana didn't believe it. She smiled brightly and mocked, "Steven, I will never forget the scene where you indulged Queenie to hurt me. Even if you weren't part of it, your money was the capital she used to hire someone to hurt me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, Steven felt that he was not wronged at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tobias was wearing a white baseball jersey, looking handsome and elegant in the sun.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He walked over with a smile and stroked the top of her head. "Diana, you have grown up and learned to protect yourself. I can be relieved when I have to go on a business trip."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was moved. "Tobias, I'm sorry for making you worry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tobias said, "I am not as worried as before. In the past, you would not fight back, which is why others would scheme against you again and again. Now that you have learned how to protect yourself. I am relieved. Let's go. Grandpa is waiting for us to have breakfast."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana took his arm and smiled, "Let's go, Tobias."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven stepped forward and said, "Diana, come back with me. Grandma wants to see you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tobias pulled Diana behind him and looked at Steven with cold eyes. He had seen Steven just now but pretended not to see him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tobias said, "Steven, Diana have already signed the divorce agreement. You forced her to sign it. As a man, you should keep your word and leave her alone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven knew what he had done was too much. "I have no intention of getting a divorce. Diana will always be my wife."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tobias was so angry that he wanted to beat Steven. "Steven, shame on you! You're dating Queenie while you're not divorcing Diana. What a bastard!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven said, "I'm sorry. This is between us as husband and wife. I've made up my mind not to divorce Diana. I regret..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana interrupted him with a cold voice, "Steven, stop talking nonsense. I must get a divorce."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="229.html">« Prev</a><a href="231.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
