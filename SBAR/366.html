She called Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was deep in a terrifying nightmare, reluctant to wake up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, the incessant ringing of her mobile jolted her awake abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She shot up in bed, drenched in cold sweat, with a profound feeling of being alive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She clutched her forehead, wracked with pain; that scene had been too excruciating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The searing pain in her hands, feet, and face, the torment of being shattered, etched itself deeply in her memory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She gasped for breath, her chest heaving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She picked up the phone and answered the call, "Hello, Paige."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige exclaimed in frustration, "Diana, Frank called me and invited me to his wedding. Can you believe it? He's acting so immature. I've been in love with him for him for so long. I feel so foolish. But I'm over it now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana chuckled, "Paige, we should really go and see his reaction."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. I've already made the arrangements. I'll make time to come back. It will just take a few days anyway. By the way, everything is going well here. Your ten male models are amazing," Paige replied, sounding more composed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana responded, "Great! I'll come with you then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure. I'll get everything settled. I've gathered a lot of information. Frank has been deceived by that woman, and he'll thank me when he finds out the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He always talks about how sweet and kind Elsie is. Would it be too cruel to give him such a surprising wedding gift?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige's voice was filled with undeniable excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No," Diana replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can't wait for it," Paige exclaimed with excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana gazed out the window, her expression turning into a frown. Winter was approaching. Some people would learn their lessons.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After offering a few words of comfort to Paige, Diana went back to sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't have any more dreams, and when she woke up, the day had already dawned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today's weather was bad; the fog was thick. Early winter often brought on rainy days, but despite the gloomy weather, Diana was in a good mood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With some initial concepts for the winter designs already in mind, she could work from home rather than commute to the office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Recalling that Joseph's grandmother was scheduled for surgery today, Diana had her dinner, instructed the housekeeper to prepare gifts, and then headed to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Outside the operating room, Joseph stood leaning against the wall, his hands dangling at his sides. He looked remarkably dashing, with tightly pressed lips, inscrutable eyes, and an air of stubbornness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had lost the simplicity and youthful energy of an 18-year-old. Instead, life had shaped him, instilling a strong sense of hostility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana approached with a smile. "Joseph."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing the familiar voice, Joseph was taken aback, finding it hard to believe. He slowly lifted his gaze, and as soon as he saw Diana, all his hostility vanished, replaced by a faint, tender smile. "Diana, you're here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah. Tom mentioned that your grandmother would have surgery today, so I came to check on her," Diana said, smiling as she walked over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph looked her in the eye. Her smile made her eyes beautiful and radiant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you!" he said, feeling delighted by her visit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled. "Let's wait in the ward. The surgery will take seven or eight hours, and you'll get tired standing here in the cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And after the operation, your grandma will be taken directly to the sterile room for observation. She won't be brought back here. Once the surgery is complete, they'll come to the ward to update us."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="365.html">« Prev</a><a href="367.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
