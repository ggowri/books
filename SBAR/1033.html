Just report her and have her livestream shut down. If she thinks she can ride this wave of attention, she's dreaming."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan blinked, taken aback. Steven had no idea what it was like in the heat of the moment. Queenie was at the peak of her popularity right now. If Evan reported her, he'd be drowned in a storm of backlash from her followers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The livestream chat was full of love-struck guys, all worshipping Queenie. It reminded him too much of how things used to be with Steven all those years ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan grinned and teased, "Mr. Gellar, now that Queenie's got all this support if I reported her now, I'd be buried in hate from all her fans. Just like how you were back then. If I even hinted at doubting Queenie, you wouldn't have let me hear the end of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven said nothing, his expression unreadable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's malicious face flashed in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He closed his eyes briefly and said, "We'll go back. I'll handle it personally."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan smiled knowingly. That was the spirit. When it came to enemies, the best way to take care of things was to do it himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, Mr. Gellar. Let's get back and set things right," Evan said, happy as he started the drive home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Steven opened his deep, intense eyes. He pulled out his phone, tapped into the security cameras, and checked where Diana was headed tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suspected she'd go back to his villa. At this point, she was only focused on protecting Leopold and her brothers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was still reeling from the kiss Steven had planted on her, her mind exhausted and conflicted as she sat in the car. She couldn't stand how Steven kept provoking her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna noticed her mood was off and grew concerned. "Diana, who was that man you were with earlier? You seemed fine before you saw him, but now you look upset. What did he say to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time Diana heard Luna's voice, the car had already pulled up to Steven's villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd chosen to stay here for now, partly because it kept her location safe. Even if Queenie found out where she was, it would protect Leopold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's influence was powerful behind the scenes, and the few assassins she had hired still hadn't shown up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana hadn't known about Queenie's hired killers until Tobias was assassinated after Leopold left. It was only then that she realized the extent of Queenie's reach, though the killers still hadn't made their move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, her focus had to be on dealing with Lillian's situation. She needed to figure out if Lillian had any connections to the </span><span>Mysterium</span><span> Organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana and Steven were technically allies now, on the same side of the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That man... his name was George.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Andrew returned, she had to come up with a foolproof plan to protect the company. With Steven's help, things would likely move faster and more smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna parked the car, and only then did Diana slowly speak, "Luna, he's Steven."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what?" Luna was shocked. She turned to look at Diana. "You're saying that the stranger from tonight was Steven?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded slightly, a teasing smile on her face as she looked at Luna's fuming expression. "Yep! Don't mention it to anyone else. Both he and Evan are fine, so you can relax now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna's face instantly turned bright red. "Diana, what are you talking about?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't respond. Instead, she opened the car door and got out. Luna had been so restless lately, hardly sleeping or eating&mdash;wasn't she just worried about Evan?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna took out her phone to get out of the car, but the flood of messages on her screen stunned her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly opened the door, got out, and walked over to help Diana into her wheelchair. Once she settled Diana, she angrily spoke up, "Diana, Queenie has handed over all the cultural relics and gained a huge reputation. She's completely cleared her name. Have you seen her livestream? In less than half an hour, her sales stayed at number one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana wasn't surprised. Queenie was always good at marketing. Olivia had even mentioned that Queenie's luck would only continue to improve. Plus, she had a way of dodging disaster whenever it came her way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, "Let's go. I'm going to give Queenie a special gift."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna wasn't quite sure what she meant, but she pushed Diana back inside the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving the party Cecil hosted, Queenie headed straight to the company to meet George.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't gone to the event tonight because he'd been on the phone with the relevant departments. He had everything set up at the company, and as soon as the news broke about Queenie selflessly handing over the cultural relics, he would immediately help clear her name. Their plan was working seamlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie looked at the livestream, her smile growing wider as the viewer count climbed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George, equally pleased, wrapped his arm around her waist and gave her a quick kiss on the lips. "Queenie, with this kind of attention, in less than a month, we'll make back all the money we've lost."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie nodded, clearly excited. "George, I've been working on an app. It's going to make us a lot of money. I've set up some payment systems in it, so once people input their information, we can immediately take the service fee. I've added some classic movies to the app too. As long as we attract millions of users, don't underestimate </span><span>that three dollars</span><span> as the service fee. If we get millions to join, in just one month, do you have any idea how much we could make?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George was impressed. He knew she was full of ideas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was smart and resourceful, which was why he'd never given up on her. Even though Diana was impressive, George preferred Queenie's sharp, ruthless nature. The two of them were soulmates, in the truest sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George smiled and lifted her into his arms, setting her down on the office desk. Queenie winced slightly at the pain in her legs but wrapped her arms around George's neck, gazing up at him with a smile. "What if he never betrays me? Would I be happy for the rest of my life?" she thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"George, you won't betray me, will you?" Queenie asked softly, her voice low.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe, just maybe, this life would have a different ending.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because, in this life, things hadn't been as smooth for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the last life, George only succeeded because of her help. His rise to power had been too easy, and it was that very success that made him lose his way among women. In the end, it was she that pushed him to his death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wondered in the last life, who he had truly fallen in love with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why couldn't she remember anything about it? The last few days, she had Mario follow him, and Mario said George's life was pretty ordinary, just trying to adjust to everything Steven was doing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George reached out and gently tapped her nose with a smile. "Silly, what are you thinking about? In this life, the person I love most is you. What do I have to do to prove it to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie knew that, no matter what promises he made, few words from a man could be truly trusted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head. She'd already been burned once by her obsessive beliefs, and she wasn't going to fall into that trap again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a bitter smile, Queenie replied, "George, I've already been betrayed by my parents' vows. From now on, I won't ask for anyone's promises, because vows only calm hearts for a moment, and in the end, they'll just fade away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"George, I don't need your guarantee. I trust you. But no one's heart stays the same forever&mdash;not even yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George froze for a moment, clearly stunned. He looked at her as if seeing her for the first time. She had really changed. He smiled softly, his eyes darkening. "Queenie, you've changed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie thought to herself, "If nothing ever changes, then it's me who will end up dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as she was about to speak, her phone buzzed with a new message. She looked at the screen, and when she saw the contents, the phone slipped out of her hand.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1032.html">« Prev</a><a href="1034.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
