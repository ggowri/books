Once the divorce was final, she would be free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jean found it unsettling to see this new side of her mother. When Lily used to enforce her strict rules, Jean felt suffocated. But now that Lily had let go, she didn't feel the satisfaction she'd anticipated; instead, there was an uncomfortable emptiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark, meanwhile, was reluctant to sign the papers. Truthfully, he wasn't so eager to marry Amelie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aside from knowing how to keep him entertained, Amelie had few redeeming qualities. She was manipulative and always scheming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily, on the other hand, was refreshingly straightforward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her, he could speak freely without constantly trying to guess her intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a placating smile, he said, "Lily, now that you're back and well, why don't we just go home? I promise I'll change for the better, and we can be a happy family again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jean, for once, stayed silent, watching Lily's hand clenched tightly at her side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily shook her head, smiling, but her tone was detached. "Mark, just sign the papers. First, you're a shameless man. Second, as a husband, you have no sense of responsibility. Third, you have a terrible temper, and you take it out on me, while my temper flares because these two kids don't listen to me and because you spend your days carousing outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to live a long, happy life, but being with you only drags down my emotional well-being. I'm a capable woman; I shouldn't be living in such humiliation. I am myself first before I am your wife or the mother of your children. But I've lost myself entirely, so why should I keep serving you and your whole family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry up and sign. I have clear evidence of your affair, as well as proof that our children prefer living with you and Amelie. With this documentation, we can finalize everything today, and after this, there will be nothing left between us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The livestream chat exploded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Cheating scumbag, just sign the papers!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Lily's so right. She was driven to this point. It's like she let a wolf into her life.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire chat was rallying behind Lily's divorce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark, feeling the weight of his pride, saw that everyone pointed fingers at him; he was filled with rage, and, in a fit of anger, he clenched his teeth and signed his name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily exhaled a breath of relief as he finally signed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing him so well had enabled her to reach this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jean, on the other hand, looked visibly nervous. But with her own pride at stake, she stayed silent, watching as her parents completed the divorce process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jean cast anxious glances at Lily, but with the reporters around, she said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had already anticipated this outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said nothing, too. Her name was now cleared, and she had even emerged as Lily's savior. Online, people were praising her beauty and kindness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that the drama had ended, the reporters began to leave the police station.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana signed her own paperwork and was free to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After signing, she walked over to Lily. "Mrs. Foliot..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I'm no longer Mrs. Foliot. Call me Ms. Robinson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded easily. "Ms. Robinson, thank you for coming today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could I not? And thank you for saving me, Diana. I have today only because of you. Facing death gave me clarity. We all carry on, and truthfully, everyone manages without each other."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana understood that Lily's words were born from the heartbreak of losing faith in her children.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had there been even a glimmer of love left, Lily would have fought to the end to protect them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Congratulations, Ms. Robinson, on your new beginning!" Diana could only offer her best wishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you! I'll be going to stay with my family for a while to recover. If you need anything, just call. Once I'm healed, I'll host an event, and you'll be the guest of honor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "Ms. Robinson, there's no need to go to all that trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, we'll see." Lily signaled her assistant to wheel her out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she and Diana headed toward the car, Jean suddenly blocked their path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, are you really going to leave me?" she asked, her eyes red with tears.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="823.html">« Prev</a><a href="825.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
