This time, you finally listened to me seriously." Tobias leaned back on the chair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana felt upset. In her previous life, it was not like this. That old lady had fainted first, and she fainted later. She then was taken away by Queenie's men, and Queenie became the old lady's savior.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Were there many things that could not be stopped in this new life?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had met Rita's grandson once. The man was stunningly handsome.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie had became good friends with him since she &ldquo;saved&rdquo; his grandma, and because of this, Queenie obtained a lot of business secrets to help a mysterious man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Who was that man? She never saw him in her previous life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tobias smiled, "The news said that Queenie saved Madam Farley of the Farley family. But it looks like you were drowned too. May I ask, why you, who is a very good swimmer, would have an accident?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The blatant ridicule made Diana unhappy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Tobias, have you brushed your teeth today?" Diana looked at him calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Well..." Tobias exhaled, looking disgusted with himself. "Do I have bad breath?" No, he sniffed, his breath was fresh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tobias understood that he got tricked. He stood up, "Hey! You ungrateful girl. I'm leaving. By the way, your ex-husband is outside. It seems that he misunderstood our relayonship."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Come on! Damn scumbag! Even if he dies, it has nothing to do with me. That blind stupid bastard..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was angry because she failed to change her fate, and she cursed the scumbag, Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven, who had just walked to the door, frowned when he heard Diana's curses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was becoming bolder and even dared to scold him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tobias saw Steven and took over her words. "Now you know that he is a scumbag. And he even slapped you. Diana, I despise you for picking such man. After you finish talking to that scumbag, call me. Dinner is your favorite lobster."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana sat up quickly. "Lobsters?! Okay! Come and pick me up in five minutes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tobias glanced at the time lovingly. "Five minutes it is."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tobias left without even looking at Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing the intimate scene between the two, Steven felt inexplicably unhappy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He walked in and looked at Diana with deep eyes. Her little face was pale and weak, yet adorable and breathtakingly beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Thinking of Tobias, who had just left, Tobias felt highly annoyed. "You have been with him for the past three months?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana knew Steven's abilities. As long as he wanted to know, he could find out everything about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">From what he said, she knew that he had not looked for her in the past three months.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There was an inexplicable pain in her heart, but her face remained indifferent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"If you have something to say, say it quickly. If not, get out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was impatient with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Thinking of how this man ruthlessly pushed her off a tall building in her previous life, hatred filled her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was looking forward to the birth of their child, but Steven's push sent her and the child to hell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, how long are you going to make trouble?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven had lost all his patience. Couldn't she just be an obedient woman like before?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Queenie made a mistake last time. It was my fault that I hit you. Come home with me now." Steven didn't want to waste time. Queenie just helped him make an appointment with Cecil to discuss business.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He must go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Home?" Diana looked at Steven's handsome and enchanting face. This scumbag had never been patient with her. But he gave all his patience to Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had been crazy in love in her previous life, becoming obsessed with him due to her handsome face. Now Diana felt that there must be something wrong with herself. There were so many good-looking men, so why would she fancy a scumbag?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven&rsquo;s father indulged in sensual pleasures and had an illegitimate child. His mother was in a mental hospital. Steven had a gloomy personality because he grew up in such a family environment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie was the light of his youth, but hearing Steven's accident, Queenie abandoned him and ran away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It hit Diana that she seemed to have never seen the illegitimate child in her previous life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As she was lost in thought, Steven's low and cold voice suddenly rang. "Diana, did you hear what I said?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="8.html">« Prev</a><a href="10.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
