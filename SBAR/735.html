Since we didn't grow up under the same roof, after I returned home, she always thought I would steal her belongings and our parents' affection. I never did any of those things. I'm grateful that on this wonderful day, I can finally clear up these misunderstandings with my sister. All my years of suffering have been worth it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, my dear sister is incredibly talented.&nbsp;She's skilled in music, chess, calligraphy, and painting. Now, she's even entered the entertainment industry. Her first film is a significant production financed by Mr. Foliot and Mr. Gellar. I hope everyone looks forward to my sister's outstanding work.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for the incident of us being switched at birth, we were both just babies then, with no say in the matter. I've come to terms with the fate that led to me being lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please give your full support to Queenie's new movie."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana deliberately directed everyone's attention to Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every word seemed calculated to benefit Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Queenie found Diana's behavior incredible.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catching Queenie's slightly surprised look, Diana flashed a faint smile. She thought, "Go ahead, Queenie, become a big star. You absolutely must become an enormous star."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wouldn't let Queenie fall so easily. All the suffering she had endured in her previous life. Queenie would have to experience it, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, her rebirth would have been for nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana took Queenie's hand and led her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She flashed a dazzling smile and waved to all the reporters.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[OMG, so this is the girl who her birth father abandoned? She's gorgeous!]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[She's not just beautiful but kind-hearted too. I'm totally in love!]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Back off, everyone; this is what my future wife looks like.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Holy cow! The moment I saw her, I knew she was my future wife material! That gentle smile could melt anyone's heart, and those sparkling eyes full of warmth just pull you right in.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Every little expression of hers is like a gentle spring breeze, sweeping across my heart and planting the seeds of love.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Buzzcut Guy: [Everyone back off, she's my wife!]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This "Buzzcut Guy" immediately got bombarded with angry responses.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As luck would have it, Steven was in his car when he saw Diana happily leading Queenie out.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned slightly. He wondered, "She could have crushed Queenie completely, so why did she choose to save her instead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven couldn't help but smile, his eyes gleaming with intrigue. He wondered what game she was playing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Evan's excited exclamation rang out. "Oh my god, Mr. Gellar, Mrs. Gellar could totally be a celebrity! Everyone online is calling her darling!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The older folks are calling her 'baby', it's so sweet! They caught Mrs. Gellar's radiant smile on camera! It's the kind of moment that takes your breath away, absolutely timeless."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven snatched the phone from his hand in one swift motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the photo of Diana's dazzling smile, her beauty seemed to freeze time itself. It was as if the whole world had stopped spinning, becoming a precious gem in his memories that would never lose its luster.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven took out his phone, saved the photo, and then called the PR department directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar." The PR manager's voice was cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's tone was ice-cold. "Delete every single photo of Diana. I don't want any of them left. And remove all those comments calling her 'darling.'"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The manager was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What was he even saying?!</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It is really tricky!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his reservations, he didn't dare to argue. With a respectful "Yes, sir," he hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a distance, Zion spotted Steven and smiled. It seemed his gamble had paid off.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he suspected, Steven did care about Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He got out of his car and walked over to welcome Queenie personally.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="734.html">« Prev</a><a href="736.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
