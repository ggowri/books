In her eyes, Queenie was very outstanding while Diana would embarrass her.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Diana thought Paula was not worthy of being her mother at all.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Paula came here to buy clothes today because her friend&#x27;s grandson&#x27;s birthday was approaching, and she wanted to buy clothes for the child.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">But why did Diana buy children&#x27;s clothes?</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Lowering her head, Paula wiped her tears and paid before leaving the mall.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">These days, she had been looking for Lily. She and Lily did the thing together at the banquet that day.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">But something happened to Lily that night. Paula knew if it weren&#x27;t for her, Lily would not have been in danger.</p><p>&quot;Mrs. Foliot, where are you? You must come back soon and protect your child.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Paula had been observing Jean these days, who didn&#x27;t care about her mother at all. Lily was missing, but Jean still went to nightclubs every day and had fun with those men.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Paula thought this was not a good thing. It was easy for Jean to get into trouble if she lived like this.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">But she was not Jean&#x27;s mother, so she couldn&#x27;t persuade Jean.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Jean and Amelie had a close relationship. Paula was worried that Jean was being used by Amelie.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Amelie must have bad intentions, and she wouldn&#x27;t be truly nice to Jean.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Feeling anxious, Paula walked out of the mall and watched Diana&#x27;s car leave. Thinking for a while, she got into the car and caught up with Diana&#x27;s car.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">After Diana left, Paula realized that she knew nothing about Diana.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">She felt even more guilty because she realized that she only knew her daughter&#x27;s name was Diana, and she didn&#x27;t know anything else.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">She only cared about Queenie and didn&#x27;t even know Diana&#x27;s friends.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Paula often thought she was a bad mother.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">It was too late for her to do anything now, but she still wanted to know Diana&#x27;s friend circle.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">She wanted to know why Diana learned design and how she and Nolan met.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Before, Diana had always taken care of Steven. She didn&#x27;t say anything, and Paula thought that Diana knew nothing. Paula also wanted to send Diana abroad to study, so that she could have a good reputation when she came back. But at that time, Diana refused. Thinking that Diana was hopeless, Paula gave up on her.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Then Paula stopped caring about Diana and focused all her attention on training Queenie.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">If Queenie married a good man in the future, it would also help Paula&#x27;s career.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Only now did Paula know that she didn&#x27;t understand Diana at all. Diana was very outstanding, but Paula had never tried to understand her excellence or her past.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Paula knew Diana was unwilling to forgive her because she had said and done things too harshly before.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">She had never really understood Diana. She preferred Queenie and only believed what Queenie said.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Now Paula thought herself was so stupid.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">She drove and followed Diana while crying.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Diana went to the villa area in Luspus.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">After Althea was taken back by her mother, she had been living here ever since, and her child was one month old.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Althea only asked Diana and Paige to come over to hold a simple banquet for the child. There weren&#x27;t many people.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Paige lived nearby, but Diana lived a little further away. It was cold and there were traffic jams everywhere. It took Diana an hour to drive to Althea&#x27;s house.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Althea was waiting for Diana at the door, holding the child in her arms, which scared Diana.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">&quot;Althea, why did you take the child out on such a cold day?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="758.html">« Prev</a><a href="760.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
