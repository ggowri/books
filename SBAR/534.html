Queenie smashed the fish tank in excitement and anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The water and fish in the fish tank poured onto the ground, and the stranded fish flapped and struggled. The water instantly flowed everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her shoes were filled with cold water, but she was so angry that she didn't care at all. "Diana, Diana, how dare you... I'm going to kill you</span><span>!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will kill your family members one by one. Don't you long for family affection? I will make sure you never get it in your life. Don't you want the love of your four brothers? I will take it all away from you and make sure you never have anyone to love you in your life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't even think about getting Steven's favor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was very tired, standing still and bending over to catch her breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anger and failure filled her chest. Originally, it was Cecil who had been schemed by her, but in the end, she was the one being schemed against.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had always been smart and could always manipulate everyone. This time, it was a conspiracy she carefully planned that could put Cecil into an irretrievable situation. Everything was under her control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she didn't expect that she would be the one being plotted against. Her face was as pale as paper, and her eyes were filled with anger and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Will this battle of the plot, would she end up with the most disastrous outcome?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie fell to the ground in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The anger in her heart could not be calmed for a long time. Perhaps it was because Diana had just seen her at her most inappropriate behavior that she felt so embarrassed and angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew her temper to some extent and on purpose to irritate her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the door, Eric looked at Queenie, who was going crazy with offish eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, without their understanding, Queenie was so ferocious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were in the past, he would definitely feel sorry for her, coax her, and take out all his pocket money to buy her expensive gifts to make her happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about what he had done before, Eric felt he was stupid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her eyes, the sincere efforts of their family were worthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie even said they owed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How shameless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric left indifferently and went downstairs to chase Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he ran downstairs, she had already gotten into the car and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the snowy city, snowflakes were falling like torn cotton wool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric felt upset.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana would never forgive them, nor would she forgive Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the beginning to the end, she was the one who was hurt the most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Eric just hoped she would be happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Steven, he was not worthy either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was only worthy of a disgusting woman like Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other side, Paula had already received the 200 million dollars returned by Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula and Linda looked at each other with smiles in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Linda looked at Paula, whose eyebrows were relaxed, with a smile in her eyes.

You played Queenie around."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But </span><span>how can you</span><span> get a divorce now? I just want to tell you that at our age, love is not important to us. You have to know how to take it and let it go. If you hold on to something that doesn't belong to you, it will only hurt you more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula smiled and said, "Linda, don't worry.
