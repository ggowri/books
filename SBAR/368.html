"Can I help you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was taken aback as she saw Joseph, secretly amazed by his stunning looks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She gave Mario a quick glance, signaling him to speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mario turned to Joseph and said, "Mr. Harrison, this is Ms. Marsh. I've done some research and it's clear that you're a top hacker. Ms. Marsh values your skills and is interested in having you develop a security software system.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Here's the contract from our company. Please check it out. If you decide to join our team, we're prepared to cover all of your grandmother's medical expenses."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon further investigation, Mario discovered that Joseph was a hacker master, earning money by completing tasks over the Internet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, due to Priya's high medical bills and his young age, he didn't get much commission.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he were to join their company, he would dominate the Internet world within five years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph stared at the arrogant Queenie, feeling uneasy all over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, thank you," he said, pushing the contract back without even glancing at it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie frowned and looked at him, then smiled and said, "Joseph, is that your name?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph nodded. He didn't want to meet her condescending gaze, which made him uncomfortable. He had an inexplicable aversion to Queenie. It felt as if she were his enemy, causing him to hate her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie offered, "Joseph, join my company. The money is really good, and your grandma will receive better treatment. I will get the best experts for her and extend her life. I can also send your grandma abroad for treatment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie persistently tried to sway him, believing that a young man like Joseph would be easily manipulated and grateful for her help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She found him quite attractive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, as Joseph listened, his expression darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He suddenly took back the contract and discovered that it was riddled with unfair terms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It outlined that within five years, his software would need to achieve certain milestones and generate specific profits. The profits would be split 70% to 30%, with him receiving only 30%.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Closing the contract with a scornful smirk, Joseph savored the last spoonful of soup. It had been a while since he had enjoyed such a tasty meal and he couldn't bear to waste a single bite.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After finishing it, he carefully replaced the lid and spoke dispassionately, "So, you intend to send my grandmother abroad for treatment in order to control me into developing software for you? Clever idea, but I decline. Please leave."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's eyes turned sinister. "Joseph, think carefully about my offer. As for your grandma, you can keep her here in the country..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, thank you, Ms. Marsh. My grandma is receiving good care here," Joseph rebuffed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's eyes turned even more menacing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph glanced at her and found her eyes full of malignity. He could sense that she wasn't a kind person at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing his continued refusal, Queenie became furious, but considering he was valuable, she restrained herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Joseph, it's an honor for you that I've come to you in person. I can make you a star in the tech world," she said.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="367.html">« Prev</a><a href="369.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
