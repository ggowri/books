"Mr. Gellar, haven't you noticed how special the coffee at your place is? Every bit of it is crafted by Diana herself. We've been savoring it for two years now. It's fantastic for fortifying our health. Of course, the coffee Diana blends for you is even better. It's a health elixir that does wonders for your body."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven fixed Diana with an astonished gaze. True enough, their home was stocked with a plethora of coffee blends, each infused with distinctive, unfamiliar ingredients, yet they tasted exquisite.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The villa where he once resided was filled with such exotic coffee varieties, and upon moving, he found their taste so delightful that he brought all of it with him to his new home.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The packaging of those coffees was distinctive. One in particular was invigorating, leaving him refreshed after each sip.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Diana divorced Steven, she had Evan send a substantial amount to his office. He drank it during work, but the brand was not visible.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It dawned on him that every cup of coffee he had savored was a masterpiece crafted by Diana's own hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A touch of awkwardness crossed his handsome face. She had truly been invisible to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I apologize. I wasn't aware you made the coffee yourself," Steven said sincerely. An urge to flee gripped him, leaving him speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had grown accustomed to his oversight, and with their impending divorce, she chose not to dwell on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's alright. No big deal," Diana murmured, lowering her head to eat. Once he finished the coffee, there would be no more. Many of the good things in life required time and effort. In the future, she would only craft them for herself and her close friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She delicately lifted a forkful of crisp salad, artfully wrapping a tender slice of steak within its leafy embrace, and brought it to her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow! This is delicious!" Diana exclaimed and replicated her culinary creation, serving portions to Althea, Paige, and Evan, deliberately skipping Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven sat there, brooding. Everyone else was enjoying themselves, except for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana wanted him to understand that he no longer held a place in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew their marriage was fragile, yet he still clung to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dinner, Diana and the others decided to head to a pub.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had an evening meeting, so he and Evan went to the presidential suite on the top floor, conveniently adjacent to Diana's.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once inside, he removed his coat and turned to Evan, who had followed him in. "Were you aware that Diana prepared the coffee?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan smiled, "Mr. Gellar, I was the one who delivered the coffee to your office. It's the coffee you've been drinking. Ms. Bishop said it would greatly aid in your eye recovery. The ingredients are quite valuable. She asked me not to tell you, fearing you'd refuse to drink her coffee if you knew, thinking she had ulterior motives. But it's nearly gone, and there's not much left."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven took a deep breath. There was still so much he didn't know.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At one point, he had trusted Diana implicitly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything changed after Queenie's return. When did he stop trusting Diana?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it during those times he "saw" Diana hurting Queenie repeatedly?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat down, irritated, feeling slightly suffocated.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat for a moment and spoke calmly, as if nothing had happened, "Go prepare for the meeting."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay!" Evan responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the two-hour meeting, Steven reviewed the surveillance footage and saw Diana and the others returning upstairs, chatting and laughing, clearly having a wonderful time.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He focused intently on Diana's delicate and beautiful face. Her smile was radiant, too dazzling to ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea and Paige were attractive as well, but Diana's allure was unmatched. Her presence was so captivating that a single glance could ensnare one's heart, making it impossible to look away.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they reached their doors, the trio bid each other farewell amidst laughter, each retiring to their respective rooms.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three had booked three presidential suites.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven stood up, intending to seek out Diana, but he paused when he noticed two suspicious men in the hallway.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought for a moment and then sat back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He watched as the two men approached the room where Diana was staying and knocked on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He abruptly stood up and quickly walked out, hoping against hope that Diana wouldn't open the door too soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had just taken off her shoes when she heard the knock. Assuming it was Paige, she hurriedly opened the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing two unfamiliar men, she was momentarily startled and regarded them warily. "Did you knock on the wrong door?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="770.html">« Prev</a><a href="772.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
