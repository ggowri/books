She hadn't expected them to show up at her door and start attacking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey! What are you doing? Let him go! Stop hitting him. Let him go!" she shouted in panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George fought back, but the second man grabbed his arms and wrenched them back, the pain snapping him to attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guy was strong, trained for this kind of thing. There was no way George could fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man glanced at Queenie, noticing her distress as beads of sweat formed on her forehead. He didn't seem to care. "Still yelling? I guess your leg's not as bad as you're making it seem. Want me to give it another hit?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the threat, Queenie instinctively pulled back, her eyes full of fear. She watched him warily, praying he wouldn't follow through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mind raced as she tried to figure out who had sent these men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't upset anyone lately, other than Steven, Diana, Paula, or maybe the Foliot family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mind briefly settled on Diana, sitting in that wheelchair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it have been her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could dwell on it further, a loud cry from George snapped her back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His head was covered, and the world around him went black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His limbs were tied up tight, and he couldn't even tell where the punches were coming from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blows came fast and hard, hitting him from all sides. He felt like a fly trapped in a storm of fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no escaping it. No matter how he twisted or turned, they kept landing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pain shot through his body like electric jolts. He had no choice but to endure it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Used to a life of comfort, George was completely helpless against the trained bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie tried to rush forward to help but was kicked back by one of the men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear and pain flashed in her eyes as she curled up, unable to defend herself. The attack had come so suddenly that she hadn't had time to prepare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the bodyguards stopped, and George was left lying on the ground, motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguards glared at George, who was lying motionless on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He might resemble Steven, but George was nothing like him, ruthless and heartless to the core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You piece of trash. Wasted my time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They turned and left, muttering insults.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie couldn't chase after them. She crawled over to George, trembling with worry as she gently shook him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"George! Wake up! Please, don't scare me. Wake up!" she cried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his eyes remained closed, and he didn't stir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood dripped from his nose, his forehead was bruised and swollen, and the smell of blood filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart clenched in fear, a gnawing frustration growing inside her as she desperately tried to figure out who was behind this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had moved to this apartment to escape any trouble, yet they had found her anyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her Christmas, which she had been so excited about, was ruined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahh!" she screamed in frustration, her voice breaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of releasing her anger, she tried to stand, but her leg flared with pain at the slightest movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She collapsed again, sobbing uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After crying for what seemed like forever, unable to get up, she crawled to the kitchen. Grabbing her phone, she dialed Mario's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hello, Ms. Marsh?" Mario's voice sounded hopeful, thinking she was calling him to spend Christmas together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her sobs echoed through the line, and he immediately panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Marsh, what happened? Why are you crying?" His voice softened in concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each sob made his heart tighten in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mario, help me! Come to my new apartment. Something's happened to me and George."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Mario gasped in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie and George were both rushed to the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the excitement she had felt for Christmas had vanished in an instant, replaced by an overwhelming sense of defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George was taken straight into the emergency room, while Queenie's leg was fractured. She'd be stuck in a wheelchair for at least three months.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite it being the holiday season, the hospital was packed with people, their faces tense and anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere was heavy, and the cold air outside only seemed to mirror her sinking mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario stayed by her side, helping her find a doctor who wrapped her leg in a cast. Once she was settled, he wheeled her outside to wait near the operating room for any updates on George.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario noticed her sullen expression but hesitated to ask what happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time he opened his mouth, he saw her steely face and held back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time dragged on until, finally, the operating room light flickered off. The doctor emerged, offering some relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George was stable. It was just a mild concussion from the beating, and after a week of observation, he'd be fine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie felt a weight lift from her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mario, let's go to his room," she said, her voice sharp, still simmering with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had to know who was behind this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they'd been waiting for George, Mario had been digging into the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd checked the surveillance footage outside her apartment and noticed something off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wheeled her into the elevator, where they were alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lowering his voice, he said, "Ms. Marsh, I reviewed the footage. The two men who attacked you were wearing masks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's heart sank. A cold chill ran down her spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt that anyone hiding their true identity must be connected to Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That damn woman is getting bolder," she thought, fury bubbling inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at Mario. "Find out who they are. This is Diana's doing. I'm sure of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was certain that Diana had been suspicious of her involvement in the accident and had intentionally targeted her for revenge today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario furrowed his brow, his voice soft but cautious. "Ms. Marsh, should we call the police?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Call the police?" Queenie scowled. She couldn't risk alerting Diana. She wasn't about to let herself become a target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was starting to feel like she didn't understand Diana at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had mastered the art of hiding her true self while she had laid everything bare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When it came to playing the game, she was no match for Diana's cunning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No police," she replied firmly. "I'll take care of this my way. Has there been any luck reaching Kara?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario shook his head. "Still no luck. We haven't been able to get in touch with Brandon either."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie felt frustration building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Call Yanson. Find out where his uncle is. We need to lock down Kara now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top priority now was to get Kara to sign the contract.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario couldn't quite grasp why she was so fixated on making that happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her growing impatience, Mario quickly dialed Yanson's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The phone rang, and as soon as it connected, Mario didn't waste time. "Mr. Hastings, where's your uncle? We can't reach him today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson's voice was sharp and filled with frustration. "I was about to ask you the same thing! Did you report my uncle? He's only met with you these past few days! Now </span><span>he's been accused of taking on shady business deals and sleeping with students. There are all sorts of allegations! And it's Christmas! What kind of mess have you made?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="958.html">« Prev</a><a href="960.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
