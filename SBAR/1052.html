All her attention was fixed on the wounds on his chest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During the car accident, Steven had shielded her, taking the brunt of the injuries. She only hurt her leg.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana took out the iodine and cotton balls, carefully disinfecting his wounds. She frowned at the sight of the blood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was focused, her movements gentle and cautious, afraid of causing him pain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven watched her, his gaze soft and full of affection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Diana finished tending to the wounds on his chest. She picked up his shirt and handed it to him. "Here, put this on."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven took the shirt and slowly put it on.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana asked him, "How long have you been here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven replied, "Not long."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana didn&rsquo;t quite understand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven shifted his body and leaned against the headboard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bed still carried her subtle, unique scent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He let himself sink into the gentle atmosphere.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kicking off his shoes, he lay down on the bed and closed his eyes. It had been so long since he&rsquo;d had a good night&rsquo;s sleep. Only by her side could he truly rest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana put the medical kit back in the cabinet. When she turned around, she saw Steven asleep on the bed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was surprised at how exhausted he must have been.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Has he not been sleeping well all this time?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Logically, he should already be dead by now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before, Queenie and George had been trying to kill him. Steven must have had trouble sleeping.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was exhausted too.</span><span> </span><span>She went to the closet, grabbed another blanket, laid it on the other side of the bed to sleep.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bed was huge, with a wide gap between them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was completely oblivious to the man lying next to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had so much work every day, always busy. When she got home, all she wanted was to lie down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana turned off the light, pulled the blanket tightly around her, and closed her eyes to sleep.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan called Paula, but she didn&rsquo;t pick up. Then he tried his two brothers. Unfortunately, they had both blocked his number.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan stared at the bustling streets, yet he didn&rsquo;t even have a place to call home.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The wind </span><span>in </span><span>February was still biting cold. He pulled his coat tighter, feeling utterly alone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The feeling was unbearable. He stood by the roadside, taking a deep breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan muttered, "You all really blocked me, huh?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was furious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marching straight into the police station, he locked eyes with the officer on duty. Sitting down on the bench, he said, "Officer, I need to report something. I can't find my mom."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two officers gave Dylan a thorough once-over, exchanging puzzled glances. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">An adult who can't find his own mom?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The officer asked, "What's your mom's name? Where does she live? Does she have any medical conditions?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">T</span><span style="font-style: italic;">hey think </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Paula</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> wandered off because she's sick?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan gave them Paula's old address and her phone number.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The officer dialed the number he provided.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The call connected. "Hello, who's this?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The officer said, "Ms. Paula Barnes, hello. We received a report from your son, Dylan, saying you were missing. May I ask where you are right now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula had already gone to bed, and hearing the officer's words, she sighed in exasperation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula replied, "Officer, I've cut ties with him. Tell him not to look for me. I'm fine. He's just after money and couldn't find me, so he turned to the police. He's an adult now; he can handle his own problems. I'm sorry."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Please pass my message to him. He'll know what it means."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The call was on speaker. The officer glanced at Dylan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan just felt awkward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula really didn&rsquo;t want him anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan let out a cold laugh as the officer politely showed him out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Dylan stepped outside, he was met by a few reporters waiting nearby.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A female reporter stepped forward and asked, "Mr. Dylan Marsh, why are you at the police station? Is something wrong?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan looked a bit surprised, unsure why there were reporters here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He suddenly remembered what Queenie had said about Diana's status being different now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "If I expose how Diana is tearing my family apart, could I destroy her reputation? Make everyone turn against the Gellar Group?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Would doing this mean Queenie and I could split half of the Gellar Group's fortune?" he wondered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan thought this plan might just work.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stared coldly at the reporter, "I called the police because my mother was manipulated by Diana Bishop, the CEO of the Gellar Group. She made my mom cut ties with me and meddled in Steven and Queenie's relationship."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And she schemed her way into taking over the Gellar Group. Diana is absolutely ruthless..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan thought of Diana, all the moments when she had been kind to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But then Queenie, with tears streaming down her face, told him how Diana had bullied her, begging him to take revenge for her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan's words had no proof, but to ruin someone, evidence was hardly necessary.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "</span><span>She</span><span> instigated my mom to cut ties with me.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As the president, Diana's personal life is a mess. She's viciously scheming for others' wealth. She doesn't deserve to be the president of the Gellar Group."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He grew more agitated, his facial muscles twitching with anger, as if he was ready to pour out every ounce of resentment he held inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I&rsquo;m making an official statement here," Dylan declared, his voice rising. "I urge everyone to hold Diana accountable for her actions! She must pay for what she&rsquo;s done! Boycott the Gellar Group&rsquo;s products!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was clearly trying to stir up the reporters&rsquo; emotions.</span><span> </span><span>But all the reporters just stared at him, dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan frowned, looking at the reporters, puzzled by their expressions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought they should be shouting with him, "Boycott the Gellar Group."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan started to wonder if he had said something wrong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked, confused, "What's wrong with you all? This is insider information I know as Diana's family. I'm not lying."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1051.html">« Prev</a><a href="1053.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
