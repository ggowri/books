His movements were fast, fierce and accurate, and the three men had almost no room to fight back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Diana was surprised. "Is he so good at fighting?" she wondered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The three men fell to the ground, looking at the muscular Steven in horror. The expression on his face was too gloomy, and he was like Lucifer demanding revenge from hell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The three of them were caught off guard by the sudden change, and they were trembling with fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked at Steven's punching movements, which were extremely tricky. "When has he ever practiced that?" she wondered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was shocked to realize that she didn't seem to know Steven well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven didn't like her, and that was right. He didn't have to like her just because she liked him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, he should not have been in the same boat with the Marsh family and Queenie when they framed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven took out his phone and called the police directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The three men were so angry that they started to cry. One of them sobbed, "Sir, I'm still in college and cannot have a criminal record. Please let me go. If I have a criminal record, how can I find a job in the future?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven looked at him coldly and snapped, "You know you can't have a criminal record, but you still don't care about your reputation. You had it coming."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man was at a loss for words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He curled up on the ground, paralyzed with dread. It was so painful that he didn't dare to speak anymore for fear of Steven's fist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This man's beating hurts so much that we have no power to fight back at all," he thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven turned to look at Diana, whose eyes were still red. His heart ached slightly, but he mocked her, "Didn't you say we lived in a society ruled by law and there wouldn't be any danger? Diana, don't you know that your face could put you in danger?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You look so seductive, so don't come out at night."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's eyes widened in anger as she thought, "So it's my fault that I'm beautiful?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you for what you did just now!" Diana didn't have the energy to argue with Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She understood what was the best revenge now. All she had to do was remain silent and ignore Steven. She wanted to give him a taste of his own medicine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven frowned and asked, "Do you have to be so polite?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked up, her eyelashes stuck together by tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's brows were tightly knitted together as he thought, "She really likes to cry. She seemed to be quite frightened just now. I was too late."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, there's no affection between us, so I should be polite."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was surprised. He had said that to Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He sneered, "You're getting smart, knowing how to diss me with what I said earlier."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven hated Diana the way she was now. The previous Diana had a lot to say in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since Queenie came back, their relationship had become worse and worse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, it had gotten to the point where they didn't want to see each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana still didn't speak, and Steven got angry. "Why don't you speak?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana lowered her head, her expression indifferent. "I don't talk to people who can't tell right from wrong."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven pursed his lips and saw the patrol police coming over. He explained the situation to the police and the three men were taken away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One of them had his face beaten severely, and he looked daggers at Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sir, I didn't even touch this woman. Why did you have to beat me so badly? Will my girlfriend still want me when she sees me like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man was taken away, crying and cursing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven didn't even glance at him. He looked at Diana and said, "I'll walk you home. I've found a few good universities recently. I'm gonna send you abroad to study."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana has never gone to college, and the Marsh family likes to make a fuss about it, so studying abroad is her best choice," Steven thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana froze. Then she looked at Steven in shock and laughed angrily. "Steven, you never really seem to understand me. I, Diana, am better than you.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="421.html">« Prev</a><a href="423.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
