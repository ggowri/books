A flicker of mockery crossed his eyes. This fool thought Diana was just some country bumpkin like all the other idiots.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clearly, hanging around with stupid people really dumbs you down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana didn't use my money to buy land. She left with nothing. Didn't Queenie tell you that? No, I guess she didn't."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's voice was ice-cold. Even through the screen, Eric felt chills down his spine, unsure which of his words had triggered Steven's anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric asked in confusion, "Steven, could she have secretly embezzled money from your company? Or maybe she took your bank cards when she left?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Eric, if your brain isn't working, I suggest you get your head examined. When she left, she walked straight out of your precious Marsh family. I give Queenie five million dollars a month for pocket money, but Diana? Not a single penny. There aren't many families as pathetic as yours." Just the Marsh family stood alone in that category.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Eric, Diana was good to you too. When you were hospitalized with a high fever, none of your family wanted to stay with you. Only Diana stood by your side, caring for you non-stop for three days and nights. Is this how you repay her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric was taken aback. He had long forgotten about this incident, and it seemed there were others like it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven, you saw it yourself last night! She left me there to die. I'm done with such a vicious sister! Now, listen, this is important. Queenie wants that piece of land. You've got to figure something out. If she can't get it, she'll cry, and you hate seeing her tears more than anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven hung up without a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric froze. Steven had always doted on Queenie, and he dared to hang up his call!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric tried calling back, but Steven wouldn't pick up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric was stunned. "Had he finally woken up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric thought about those three days and nights when he was sick. Queenie had piano practice, and he couldn't bear to make her look after him. But Diana, who'd always done the heavy lifting, taking care of him for three days wouldn't be a big deal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since Steven was a dead end, he waited outside for Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sure enough, a few minutes later, he spotted Diana and Elroy coming out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Elroy left, Eric rushed over to block Diana's path.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking down his nose at her, he barked, "Diana, Queenie's got her eye on the land you just bought. Hand it over to her, and I'll convince Mom and Dad to let you back into the Marsh family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana pressed her lips together, looking at him like he was the village idiot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She chuckled as if she'd just heard the most hilarious joke in the world. A smirk played on her lips as she drawled. "Eric, have you lost your mind? Ever since I cut ties with the Marsh family, my life has been absolutely wonderful. Being related to greedy people like you made me sick to my stomach every morning."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, you... you'd better watch yourself. Without the Marsh family's protection..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh please, I'm doing just fine without the Marsh family's protection," she said with casual indifference.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric raised an eyebrow and sneered. "I heard you're a designer now. What if I were to report your heartless behavior..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana cut him off with a scornful laugh, her eyes gleaming with pride as she spoke with lazy contempt. "Eric, I told you last night. Go ahead, tell the whole world. Besides, I have nothing to do with your family anymore, and I'd rather not see any of you again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the morning light, her casual posture radiated an intimidating coldness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric could genuinely feel how Diana had changed, becoming someone far beyond his reach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He blocked her path. "No way. You're not leaving until you hand over that piece of land to Queenie!"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="450.html">« Prev</a><a href="452.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
