How can you still be alive?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The real Andrew appeared at the doorway just like that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Behind him stood many law enforcement officers in blue uniforms and reporters holding cameras, broadcasting the scene live in real-time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Charlie, I</span><span>'</span><span>m indeed not dead, but I</span><span>'</span><span>ve been no better than a walking corpse. Over the years, you</span><span>'</span><span>ve taken my identity to commit all sorts of crimes. If I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t show up now, were you planning to use my name to harm the world and amass wealth?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew's eyes were filled with resentment. For over twenty years, he was forced to live in darkness, bedridden like a useless man for years.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, even after regaining consciousness, he was still like a fool. If not for his wife's meticulous care, he would have remained a useless person for the rest of his life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After he finished speaking, the reporters burst into an uproar.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two of them really looked identical.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A reporter looked at Andrew and asked, "Mr. Andrew Gellar, what exactly is going on? Are you twins? Why do you look identical?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Charlie froze, staring at Andrew in fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked fine, and he was actually alive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew sneered as he watched Charlie's panicked expression, feeling even more hatred inside. "Today, I gathered everyone here to expose a fifty-year-old conspiracy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fifty years ago, rumors about the Mysterium Organization's genetic black technology turned out to be true. The person standing opposite me is the product of a successful experiment&mdash;they used technology to perfectly replicate my appearance. Not only that, they even targeted my son and created another George.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We are not related by blood at all. Twenty-five years ago, this person suddenly appeared in my life and caused a car accident. After I became a vegetative state, he took over my life, abused my son Steven, and even planted many spies around Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He didn't even spare my wife. To protect my family and completely eradicate the Mysterium Organization, I knew I had to stand up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The current flu virus was released by them, and the relevant authorities already have evidence. Mysterium Organization specializes in spreading viruses and profiting from special medicines. According to my investigation, the pandemic twenty years ago, which lasted four years and killed millions, was orchestrated by them. The company that made $190 billion from special medicines is actually owned by Mysterium Organization."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was instantly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Charlie furiously shouted, "Nonsense! I am the real Andrew, you're the fake!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew sneered, "Charlie, the evidence is right in your possession. I've waited until now just to see your son show up, but I didn't expect you'd be deranged enough to try the same trick to make money again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Charlie stared coldly and said, "You're slandering me! How could I have any evidence?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This matter starts with Uncle Wyatt. In the Gellar family, there were two top scientists, one was Uncle Wyatt, and the other was me. Back then, I accidentally entered their lab, and they targeted my family background, using me as a test subject. Later, even my son couldn't escape. This technology is terrifying. After you and your son were created, the lab was destroyed, but you two 'products' remained in the world."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop struggling, Charlie. Today, I brought all the evidence and law enforcement to bring you to justice."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, your son has already been arrested downstairs, and all the funds you transferred are under our surveillance. Over these three days and nights, I worked with the relevant authorities to gather all the evidence."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your proudest Mysterium Organization was reduced to rubble by a foreign helicopter an hour ago."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've cut off all your money-making channels."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Andrew's eyes were filled with indifference, while Charlie clutched the computer, retreating continuously."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The livestream room erupted instantly, and comments flooded in like a tide."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"[Heaven won't tolerate this! They are shameless beasts! Aren't they afraid of retribution? All they care about is money and never about how ordinary people are doing. They're simply inhuman.]"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"[I want to kill him and these scumbags. How is this different from murder? We must punish them severely! Make that old man pay with his life.]"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"[In such difficult times, they still think about exploiting us and making huge profits. Do these merchants have no conscience? They don't see us as humans, only care about squeezing profits, and slaughter us at will. We must punish these bastards severely.]"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"[Bastards! Ordinary people are already suffering enough, yet they still want to profit from disasters. They're so shameless, we must make them pay!]"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Steven received a call from Evan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Gellar! Quick, watch the live stream! Something big happened!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Listening to Evan's incoherent words, Steven frowned, "Explain clearly what happened."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan replied, "Your father is back! Watch the live stream now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven frowned, suddenly recalling the text he had just received: [Steven, leave the upcoming matters to Dad and Grandpa. I've let you and Diana down all these years.]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He immediately hung up the phone and opened the live stream.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Diana also woke up, and Steven sat beside her, whispering, "Diana, look."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing the reporter address her as Andrew, she forced herself to perk up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When she saw two identical Andrews in the live stream, she rubbed her eyes hard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When he looked closely, he noticed there were two identical Andrews in the live stream, one sitting in a wheelchair and the other standing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana quickly rubbed her eyes, looked again, and confirmed there were indeed two identical Andrews.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was shocked and thought, "Are they both Andrew?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "The one in the wheelchair is my father."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana suddenly understood why Jenny was always out and couldn't take care of Steven all those years.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Turns out she was taking care of her real husband.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was completely stunned. In her previous life, she was reborn after George's suicide and had no idea such a shocking secret was hidden behind.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1081.html">« Prev</a><a href="1083.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
