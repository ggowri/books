His mood deflated, and he lay flat on his back, feeling depressed. His age was catching up with him, but he'd always been interested in Paula, who maintained a perfect figure. Queenie's mother, on the other hand, had gained weight and lost some of her youthful charm. Yet she was his first love, the one who made his heart race.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He replied calmly, "No, it was Diana. Queenie is too kind to do such a thing." He was confused as to why the two men had turned on them despite being paid.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula sneered, realizing how foolish she'd been to follow Jeff and Queenie, hurting Diana in the process. She knew how painful misunderstandings were&mdash;she'd experienced it herself. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had endured so much over the years, and Paula regretted not believing her own daughter. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Diana wanted nothing to do with her, and Paula knew she deserved it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't anticipated that Queenie and Jeff were behind it all, even winning over her four sons, who were now distant and often absent. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale, for instance, was obsessed with racing, a costly hobby, funneling most of his company's earnings into it. Jeff offered no meaningful guidance to his sons, allowing them to drift aimlessly. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reflecting on it, Paula realized what a terrible father Jeff was, indulging his sons into uselessness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chilling thought crossed her mind&mdash;perhaps Jeff had another son. It would explain his desire to sabotage her children and her. Queenie would eventually marry, and Jeff must have another heir.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula was in agony but was jolted by the sound of Jeff's snoring. She sat up, grabbed her pillow, and moved to the next room to sleep. Jeff, deep in slumber, didn't notice her absence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Steven returned to the villa, it was dark and empty. Without Diana, the house felt lonely. He collapsed onto the sofa, wondering how long Diana would stay angry. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He laughed at himself, recalling his cold demeanor in the past, yet now he couldn't stop thinking about her. This realization left him unsettled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sitting in the dark for a while, he turned on the light. He hadn't eaten dinner and felt a slight pang of hunger. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Opening the fridge, he found it empty except for a strange smell. When Diana was home, it was always stocked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He went to the kitchen and found his favorite brand of spaghetti, along with Diana's beloved cookies. She craved sweets once or twice a month, so there were always cookies around. Not fond of cookies himself, he opted to cook spaghetti.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he ate, he couldn't help but think it didn't taste as good as Diana's. She always cooked it perfectly. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he returned home late from social events, she would have a delicious midnight snack ready for him. After eating, he felt somewhat better.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heading upstairs, he returned to his room. He and Diana had never shared a bedroom; he stayed in the master suite, and she had the room next door. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being married for two years, they hadn't been intimate. He made it clear on their wedding day, and Diana never pushed him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet she was always talkative, with much to say. Now, her absence left an eerie silence. He remembered the innocent girl who had once said, "Steven, from today, I'm your wife, and I will love you." </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had coldly replied, "I'll wait for Queenie to come back," wiping the smile from her face. He hadn't seen her smile warmly since.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven opened the door to Diana's room. It was tidy, with pink sheets on the bed and some unused cosmetics on the dresser. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nothing had changed since she left after signing the divorce papers. Sitting on her bed, he felt the weight of her absence. There were only traces of her life left behind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reflecting on how Diana had cured his eyes, Steven felt conflicted. He stood up and slowly left her room. As he reached the door, his phone rang. It was Owen.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello," Steven answered quietly, feeling a sense of pressure.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, I'm back. Let's have dinner. Alexander is here, too. You should know him. He's just returned. Let's get together," Owen said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Alexander's name, Steven agreed, "Send me the address."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, he received the details and asked Evan to pick him up. He changed into comfortable casual clothes and headed to the bar.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forty minutes later, he arrived at a high-end bar. The private rooms were elegantly designed, offering a unique and noble experience. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several young men from Capitole were there. When Steven arrived, they greeted him respectfully.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen, handsome and about six feet tall, with clear eyes and charming features, contrasted Steven's cold demeanor. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, similar to Steven, was calm and reserved but capable of being lively. His mixed emotions were hard to decipher.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded at Steven and returned to his phone. Owen, having met Alexander abroad, joked, "Mr. Powell, you're smiling and texting. Do you have a girlfriend?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaning back on the sofa, Alexander replied, "I'm pursuing a girl I met on a blind date. She's interesting, excellent, and calm. I'm curious if she likes me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's expression changed. Alexander was talking about Diana. Owen, intrigued, asked, "Who is it? I didn't know you were interested in women before. Who's caught your attention since you returned?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're interested, I'll introduce her next time. We have a dinner date the day after tomorrow. Her name is Diana," Alexander said, glancing at Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven returned the glance coldly. "Mr. Powell, it's not right to pursue someone else's wife."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="63.html">« Prev</a><a href="65.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
