Instead, he settled comfortably on the sofa, exuding a relaxed air.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He&#x27;d found something curious - Diana was a bit afraid of him.</p><p>Whenever he showed a hint of dominance, she would act like a startled kitten, all claws out, ready to flee and defend herself.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Observing her closely, he realized she still had feelings for him. Although she often snapped at him with unkind words, her body language told a different story. She didn&#x27;t mind his presence.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It filled him with unexpected delight.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He raised an eyebrow, a teasing smile playing on his lips. &quot;Diana, are you scared of me?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Why would you say that?&quot; Diana responded, confused.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Why would I be scared of you?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">His gaze was steady, catching her off guard as her eyes darted away. &quot;If you&#x27;re not scared of me, why do you keep avoiding me?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She sighed, feeling a mix of annoyance and amusement.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven had become a puzzle she couldn&#x27;t quite solve.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Evan once mentioned that when he smiled, it usually meant he was upset.</p><p style="text-align:left;">And right now, his smile felt more like a mask for irritation.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Before she could reply, Harlan burst into tears.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana jumped, quickly rushing to comfort him. &quot;Don&#x27;t cry, little one! Did Steven scare you? I&#x27;ll take care of him. He just bullied me a moment ago. Can you stop crying for me?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Holding Harlan in her arms, she moved around the room.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Seeing her gentle demeanor made Steven&#x27;s lips twitch upward involuntarily.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Is he hungry?&quot; he asked, standing up.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana pointed at the pink diaper bag. &quot;There&#x27;s some prepared milk powder in there. Could you grab it for me?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She felt flustered as this was her first time caring for a baby.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven rummaged through the bag and found the small, adorable bottle. His heart softened at the sight. He walked over and handed it to her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She settled back onto the sofa, placing the nipple in Harlan&#x27;s mouth. After a couple of sips, the little guy stopped crying, his wide eyes sparkling with curiosity. When he spotted Diana, he broke into a big grin.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her heart melted. &quot;Oh, don&#x27;t smile too much, or you might choke!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">But the baby, oblivious, just kept beaming.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As Harlan continued to sip, he paused to gaze up at her, a smile stretching across his tiny face.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven watched from the side, feeling an inexplicable joy at the scene.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Once Harlan was happily munching away, he babbled, trying to engage Diana in conversation.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She looked into his bright eyes, her face lighting up. &quot;You&#x27;re so adorable, Harlan! I just love you!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her voice was soft and affectionate, warming Steven&#x27;s heart even further.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;He is cute,&quot; he chimed in.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana shot him a quick look but kept quiet.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Gently rocking the baby, she cooed, &quot;Harlan is the cutest!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven almost let slip that they should have a baby, but remembering her earlier enthusiasm, he bit his tongue.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Where&#x27;s his mother?&quot; he asked, changing the subject.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Off to see some muscular guy.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;What kind of guy?&quot; Steven furrowed his brow.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She pointed downward. &quot;Down in the basement.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Understanding dawned on him, and he chuckled, &quot;Why aren&#x27;t you going with her?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I&#x27;m not interested. I prefer young men.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He shook his head in disbelief.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;So, you like the guy who danced with you at noon?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana shot him an incredulous look. &quot;Steven, how could you even ask that? If I didn&#x27;t like you back then, why would I have married you? I&#x27;m not the kind of person who just marries anyone on a whim.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Honestly, I really like your type. Even after our divorce, I&#x27;d probably look for someone like you.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She pondered for a moment about Alexander. He wasn&#x27;t a bad choice. Steven could throw accusations her way, but questioning their past relationship was crossing a line.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven took a deep breath, choosing to stay quiet for now. At least she still liked his type.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Okay, I got it,&quot; he said, his tone casual.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana felt a bit surprised, unsure of how to interpret his words.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="789.html">« Prev</a><a href="791.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
