Even Charlie didn</span><span>'</span><span>t suspect that his kindness was fake. Charlie kept pushing him to marry her until Steven reclaimed Charlie</span><span>'</span><span>s shares</span><span>, but then Charlie devised</span><span> an even more vicious plan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "Diana, I wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t lying to you. I had to stop Charlie from going after Grandpa and Grandma, and protect you from Queenie. I could </span><span>only keep</span><span> giving you divorce papers, trying to make you leave. As long as you left, I wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t have to worry about you anymore."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He let out a quiet sigh.</span><span> </span><span>"But then things started spiraling out of my control, especially after I found those photos of Queenie and George. </span><span>I thought I</span><span>'</span><span>d wait for Grandpa to get back, then take Charlie down for good. But you... you didn</span><span>'</span><span>t wait around.</span><span> </span><span>You</span><span> fought back. And </span><span>watching </span><span>Queenie, Paula, and Jeff bullying you&mdash;it made me furious."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glanced out the window, stunned. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had slept the entire day. After today, she didn</span><span>'</span><span>t want to hear about the past anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She slowly got out of bed and said, "Don</span><span>'</span><span>t bring </span><span>any of that up</span><span> again. I don</span><span>'</span><span>t want to hear it. </span><span>I thought I</span><span>'</span><span>d wait for Grandpa to get back, then take Charlie down for good. But you... you didn</span><span>'</span><span>t wait around.</span><span> Whether I</span><span> </span><span>loved you, </span><span>or might ever love you again</span><span>, </span><span>it doesn't matter. </span><span>I</span><span>'</span><span>m putting myself first</span><span> from now on</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She stood, her voice steady.</span><span> </span><span>"Those days loving you all hurt me so much. From now on, anyone who dares to hurt me, I</span><span>'</span><span>ll make sure they regret it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, with a small huff, she added,</span><span> </span><span>"Get up already. Let</span><span>'</span><span>s have some </span><span>s</span><span>ashimi-grade tuna</span><span>. </span><span>You</span><span>'</span><span>re getting </span><span>i</span><span>t </span><span>tonight.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Diana slipped on her shoes and headed to the bathroom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven </span><span>watched her go, a soft smile forming on his lips.</span><span> </span><span>She really had a kind heart&mdash;even after everything.</span><span> From now on, he wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t let her hurt again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He got up slowly, then headed to the bathroom. After freshening up, he went to the kitchen to help her prepare the tuna.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven took out the </span><span>tuna out of the fridge</span><span>. </span><span>It was pretty big,</span><span> easily over ten pounds</span><span>. H</span><span>e couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t help but wonder how she managed to haul it up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven had never handled this kind of fish before and felt a bit at a loss.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then came the sound of soft footsteps behind him.</span><span> </span><span>Turning around, he saw Diana walking into the kitchen, tying an apron as she moved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at him, and he stared at the fish, clearly clueless about what to do.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smirked confidently. "</span><span>Yeah, you</span><span>'</span><span>re not gonna manage that.</span><span> Go wash the veggies, I'</span><span>ve got it</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven chuckled. The best meals he</span><span>'</span><span>d ever had were in those two years with Diana by his side.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright!" Steven said, heading off to wash the veggies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana took out a long, gleaming knife and began slicing into the tuna with practiced ease.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her movements were </span><span>sharp, confident. Leopold had drilled self-reliance into her since she was a kid.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t much of a </span><span>gourmet chef</span><span>, but Hubery loved </span><span>sashimi-grade tuna</span><span>. He had taught her everything. Over time, she started picking things up quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven watched, "</span><span>Where</span><span>'</span><span>d you learn to do that?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at him and smiled. "Hubery taught me. I was a picky eater as a kid, and he</span><span>'</span><span>d always coax me to eat. As he got older, he started cooking for me instead."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hubery</span><span>'</span><span>s cooking was amazing. Then I married you and realized you weren</span><span>'</span><span>t too fond of the meals the staff made. So, I started learning to cook for you. That smoky bacon chowder you love? It</span><span>'</span><span>s not exactly easy to make. Good food always takes time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven suddenly found himself craving her smoky bacon chowder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An hour and a half later, the two sat at the dining table. Steven looked at the spread of dishes and felt genuinely happy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana slid </span><span>a plate of </span><span>sashimi-grade tuna</span><span> toward </span><span>him</span><span>. She had </span><span>added </span><span>just </span><span>a touch of wasabi and an extra squeeze of lemon.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven </span><span>picked up a piece and </span><span>took a bite. "Diana, this is </span><span>incredible</span><span>. Fresh, sweet, and so tender."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana </span><span>tasted </span><span>a piece herself and nodded in approval. "The fish here is the best. </span><span>Try the others too&mdash;they're just as good.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled brightly. "Alright! Thanks, Diana."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two of them happily enjoyed their dinner.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two spent ten joyful days on the island until Evan called, informing them that Edward was hospitalized. Only then did Steven take Diana back to the city.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By the time they got back, it was already noon. They headed straight to the hospital owned by Edward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the luxurious VIP ward, Edward lay </span><span>unconscious in bed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven walked in and called out, "Grandpa."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew was still seated in his wheelchair, with Jenny standing behind him. Seeing Steven and Diana, both of them lit up with joy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Steven so anxious, Andrew reminded him, "Steven, don</span><span>'</span><span>t worry. Your grandpa just passed out from being too upset."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After you left, yesterday afternoon, someone suddenly targeted the company</span><span>'</span><span>s stocks. Your grandpa got too worked up and passed out. The doctor said he had a minor stroke, but he</span><span>'</span><span>ll be fine once he wakes up."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as he takes good care of himself from now on, it shouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t be a big problem."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at Diana anxiously. "Diana, can you check on Grandpa?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glanced at the unconscious Edward and gave a slight nod. She sat down and began examining him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A few minutes later, Diana looked at Steven. "Edward</span><span>'</span><span>s fine, just a minor stroke. Stay here with him. I</span><span>'</span><span>ll head to the lab to prepare his medicine and come back tomorrow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Steven could respond, Jenny chimed in, "Steven, you should take Diana there. </span><span>Andrew</span><span> and I will take care of your grandpa."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven gave a slight nod. "Alright, I</span><span>'</span><span>ll take Diana."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven eventually took Diana to the lab.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana walked in and immediately ran into Chloe. Chloe's gaze shifted nervously when she saw Diana, but the moment her eyes landed on Steven, jealousy flickered across her face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Diana has everything, even a man as amazing as Steven willing to marry her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana ignored Chloe and went straight to find Tom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tom smiled. "Why not take a few more days off?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at Diana. "You've been studying </span><span>your whole life</span><span>. Can't you give yourself a few more days off?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought </span><span>short </span><span>breaks were fine, but long ones would make her lazy. "Tom, Edward had a mild stroke. I'm here to prescribe his medication."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone in the lab said, "Then you better head in. Don't worry about the special medication, we've got it covered. The condition is under control, and everyone</span><span>'</span><span>s praising you two. Spending billions&mdash;so generous of you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Tom wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t too happy. These medications would set Diana</span><span>'</span><span>s company back by ten years.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana noticed his displeasure and smiled. "Tom, I</span><span>'</span><span>m fine. Money can always be earned again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glanced around and asked in a low voice, "Tom, </span><span>h</span><span>ave you found </span><span>the mole in the lab </span><span>yet?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1106.html">« Prev</a><a href="1108.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
