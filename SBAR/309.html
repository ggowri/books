He said the projects suited him better. Aren't you all family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jace hung up right after that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was sitting beside him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff had already left, but he was hugging Queenie in a particularly suggestive manner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie had a strange smile on her face. Jace thought she was a sweet charm, not realizing she was actually a harbinger of doom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank immediately rushed to Jeff's company to confront him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He kicked open his father's office door. "Dad, how could you take my deals? You know my company needs them. I'm getting married at the end of the month. I'm your son. Why would you steal from me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank had some business sense, but his temper was too volatile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When things went wrong, he only looked for others to blame, never reflecting on himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff laughed and said, "Frank, my company is also in crisis. I'm your father. Can't you give way for me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Back then, to support his son and his lover, Jeff hadn't joined Paula's company. Instead, Paula had funded the startup of his business.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Financial freedom allowed his lover to live the life of a wealthy wife, enabled his son to study abroad, and provided the capital to start a company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was furious. He realized Queenie was also involved. He felt heartbroken. Queenie knew he nearly bankrupted his company for her, yet she didn't stop his father from taking the deals.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Feeling dejected, Frank hung his head and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana wasn't aware of these events, but Cecil had managed to capture the scene on video and sent it to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was surprised when she watched the video. Jace's favoritism towards Queenie was unexpected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had given the deals to both Jeff and Frank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil texted: [Unfortunately, my people were kicked out at that moment and couldn't hear the conversation.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana replied: [This is enough. At least we can track their every move.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana let out a cold laugh.&nbsp;"Frank, being betrayed by your family must be painful, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Watching Frank leave Jeff's office with his head down, Diana knew he was hurt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana felt satisfied, and Paula had also finally come to her senses and started targeting Jeff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What's Paula's background?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Barnes family had been in business for generations; even Paula's mother was a formidable businesswoman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula herself was a business elite. Recently, she had been secretly transferring assets, pushing the company into a crisis.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Diana was surprised by this move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula was constructing another skyscraper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she finally revealed her cards, Jeff and that woman outside would probably be left with nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, a faint smile appearing on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In this lifetime, Diana no longer cared about Paula's fate. She wasn't lacking in motherly love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana lowered her gaze. In her previous life, Queenie hadn't ventured into the entertainment industry. This lifetime had broken the past trajectory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her previous life, with Steven and Cecil's help, her secret company went public within a year.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Biting her finger, Diana pondered,&nbsp;"Where would that boy show up?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That boy is a skilled hacker, wild in behavior, but his background limits his potential.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He's crucial, but where should I look for him?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="308.html">« Prev</a><a href="310.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
