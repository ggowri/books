There were these two incredibly hot guys! They were like walking sculptures, with sharp features and perfect muscles! Seriously, how do they manage to look that good?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Oh my gosh!&quot; she exclaimed, her eyes sparkling with enthusiasm. &quot;I swear, the moment I saw them, I felt all fluttery inside! I nearly wanted to throw myself at one of them!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana chuckled, amused by their excitement.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paige, even more animated, chimed in, &quot;But I have my eyes on someone else. He&#x27;s 6&#x27;2&quot;, with broad shoulders and every muscle perfectly defined. Just picturing myself wrapped in those arms gives me butterflies!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana laughed, watching the two gush over the handsome men. &quot;So, did either of you get their contact info?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paige nodded eagerly. &quot;I accidentally bumped into my crush and got to touch his muscles! I was so tempted to pull him into my room for a little fun! But then I got nervous. His gaze was intense, almost calculating. As kids, we feared monsters because they looked scary. Now, we learn to be cautious of people who seem polished but might be hiding something.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;So I decided to let it go. A relationship needs mutual honesty. One-sided honesty just ends up hurting me. It&#x27;s best to admire from afar,&quot; she concluded, her tone resolute.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Now, she was clear-headed and no longer forced herself into relationships that didn&#x27;t fulfill her. Even if someone piqued her interest, she wouldn&#x27;t sacrifice her self-worth for it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana smiled at her friend&#x27;s clarity. &quot;Paige, most people cling to their first crushes. You&#x27;re single now. Why not explore a little?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Absolutely not, Diana!&quot; Paige shook her head. &quot;I like him, but he&#x27;s not right for me. I&#x27;ve liked your brother for years, but he treated my feelings like trash. I&#x27;ve learned my lesson. No man is worth losing myself over. I&#x27;ll grow like a sunflower, reaching for the light, with or without him.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">No matter how great a man might be, if he didn&#x27;t know how to cherish you, he was not worth your time.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana grinned, appreciating Paige&#x27;s wisdom.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Look at us! The three of us, once love-struck, finally waking up! In love or not, we must carry ourselves with grace. My heart will shine like the sun, unafraid of sorrow.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Exactly!&quot; Paige agreed. &quot;But hey, neither of us has had our first time yet. How about we find a male model? We need to experience being women before 30!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana was taken aback. That wasn&#x27;t her plan at all.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Uh, Paige, I&#x27;m still young...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You&#x27;re not as young as you think! Don&#x27;t waste your youth! Remember those ten male models I worked with? Each one is a total dreamboat, and I made a fortune from them! Why not pick one and have a little fun?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Paige, if you want to play, don&#x27;t drag my wife into it!&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="794.html">« Prev</a><a href="796.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
