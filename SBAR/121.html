You can't do this. Queenie will suffer for the rest of her life." Gale was anxious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven sneered and said clearly, "At that time, I promised to marry her because I thought she was the biological daughter of your family, but the biological daughter of your family turned out to be Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I only have childhood friendship with her. She doesn't deserve to be my wife. Why should I marry a waste?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Gale, you'd better pray that Diana is okay. If she has any injuries, I will kill you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven hung up the phone angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After saying that, he strode out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan understood and went to prepare the car immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the sports car, Gale was stunned, watching Diana's car parked in front of the high-end shopping mall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He also stopped the car and thought about Steven saying that he would not marry Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What should he do?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If Diana didn't come back, Steven and Queenie would not be together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was such a troublemaker.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale opened the car door and got out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana and Luna also knew that Gale was following them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The two didn't care but went to the mall to buy clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tobias also came.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The two went to the women's clothing department, bought some clothes, changed their clothes, and came downstairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale had been waiting at the door. When he saw Diana coming out with a wound on her face, Gale pursed his lips slightly. He walked over and blocked Diana's way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana frowned when he heard Tobias' voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, are you okay?" Tobias hurried to her side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana threw herself into Tobias' arms and said, "Tobias, I was scared to death."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna was stunned that Diana acted like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tobias whispered to her, "Don't be afraid, Diana, I am here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tobias patted her back and sounded doting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale looked at the two people hugging each other and felt inexplicably unhappy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana had never called him so sweetly like this before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But he had completely forgotten that it was he who did not allow Diana to call him like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Your face is injured?" Tobias felt distressed and said, "I have already informed them. Those people are suspected of multiple crimes and will not come out again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Gale heard this, he looked at Tobias with a more scrutinizing look. He said anxiously, "Diana, Harry was just joking with you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana interrupted him with a cold voice, "Joking? Gale, do you believe yourself when you say this? That man called you in front of me. You are as vicious as Queenie."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Perhaps Gale just wanted to teach her a lesson about what happened today, but Queenie must have been involved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Gale, Queenie is unhappy, so you want to destroy me? Steven doesn't want to go with me to get a divorce, is it my fault? I have severed ties with your family and have long been away from you. What does her unhappiness have to do with me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Why should I be responsible for her unhappiness?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Gale, do you know why they didn't reveal the mastermind today? Because in half a month, your life will be over. I kindly remind you that you'd better not participate in the competition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"If you participate in the competition, you will understand why you didn't go to jail today and why they didn't expose you. You will know on that day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If Steven didn't marry Queenie, she would cause even more trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It would only speed up her killing her brothers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This was the second time Gale had heard this. He shouted angrily, "Diana, you don't have to speak so sarcastically. I have watched Queenie grow up..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana smiled and nodded, saying, "Isn't it better for you to believe her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The more he believed Queenie, the more hurt he would be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"By the way, although I am no longer your sister, I still want to remind you that it is best not to participate in that race competition," </p><div class="pagination"><a href="120.html">« Prev</a><a href="122.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
