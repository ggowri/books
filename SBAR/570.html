She's willing to have your child, and Diana didn't tell you? She's at the hospital with Althea right now. Look at how pathetic your life is&mdash;your own foster sister is plotting against you, your blood sister is keeping secrets, and even the woman you love has abandoned you to raise your child alone. You've really hit rock bottom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Penelope, cut the crap! Where's Althea?" Gale snapped back, his fury palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! After all the pain you caused her, do you really think she'd want to see you now? Gale, you've always been shameless, and your character is beyond terrible. If it weren't for wanting you to be a father to my child, do you think I'd even bother with a fool like you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're so blind! You don't even love your own sister but are infatuated with that conniving Queenie. I wouldn't be surprised if you two were having an affair; otherwise, why are you so biased toward her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut your mouth, Penelope! If you want me to help you, tell me where Althea is!" Gale's voice was sharp, cutting through the tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was exactly what Penelope had been waiting for. "You get me out of here, and I'll tell you where Althea is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead of responding, Gale asked Felix, "Excuse me, officer, could you tell me where the police station is? I'm on my way there right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope froze, thinking, "What's happening?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Gale really just ask the police directly?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is he not leaving the country after all?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rihull Island Police Station," Felix replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks! But I'm not her family, so maybe you should let her call someone else," Gale said before abruptly hanging up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was done with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahhh!" Penelope screamed in despair, her world crumbling around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix glanced at her, unfazed. "Alright! Since no one's coming to your rescue, we'll start the interrogation at nine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope's mind raced. She thought of Queenie&mdash;maybe she could reach out for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have a sister! I still have a sister!" she shouted, her voice filled with renewed hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix raised an eyebrow, watching her theatrics. He handed her the phone, and she quickly dialed Queenie's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello?" Queenie answered, caught off guard since it wasn't Penelope's phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey!" Penelope said, glancing at Felix, who purposefully stepped away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The phone had an automatic listening feature, and Felix wanted to gather more secrets from this woman, so he turned to give her some privacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, I need you to help me. I'm pregnant, and I'm in a bind. Can you bail me out?" Penelope's voice trembled with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? What did you do to end up in the police station?" Queenie asked, her tone incredulous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Althea! She's pregnant and having her baby on the island, and Diana's here with her. I planned to kidnap her baby and threaten her for money, but things went wrong, and now I'm stuck. You need to bail me out! I can tell you where Althea is, and you wouldn't want that kid back to threaten your position, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope prayed her words would work, but deep down, she wasn't sure if she could sway Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie let out a cold laugh. "Penelope, have you been hiding under a rock? The Barnes Group just went bankrupt. Paula's drowning in a billion in debt! You want to come back and pay her off? I suggest you go get a marriage license with Gale tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? Queenie, you pulled it off? You took control of the entire Barnes Group?" Penelope's mind raced as she realized the extent of Queenie's cunning.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="569.html">« Prev</a><a href="571.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
