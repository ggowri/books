He now had no proof that she had plotted against Rita before.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Dealing with someone as arrogant as Cecil was simple.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jace, with his cunning, knew that as long as Cecil was taken to the police station and the scandal spread online, it would cause serious damage to the Farley family, especially with Rita's son still overseas.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Timing was everything, and to make the numbers in his bank account grow, blood had to be shed. That was the rule of survival in the business world.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He said, "Queenie, don't worry. I have already called the police, and Mr. Gellar and I will support you. You won't be in trouble."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jace smiled as he looked across at Steven.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie whispered, "Thank you!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven stood calmly on the side, appearing indifferent. His posture was elegant, but his slightly downcast eyes were filled with cold rage, making it hard for anyone to meet his gaze.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Diana glanced over, Steven finally looked at her, but all he saw in her eyes was hatred.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tonight, Queenie had exploited everything thoroughly. The dress in the trunk was actually meant for Diana.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't figure out how Queenie knew there was a dress in the trunk that matched hers. Before they even met Jace, wine had already spilled on Queenie's dress.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie knew he would prepare a dress for her; it was something he often did in the past. But now he had prepared one for Diana, who looked lovely in pink.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie wore it instead.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All of it was part of Queenie's meticulously crafted plan.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil had only seen Diana, and it was seeing her that brought him in.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie had impersonated Diana just to lure everyone into her trap.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No wonder he had been played by Queenie all these years. Her acting skills were truly impressive.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had raised a wolf, blind to its true nature.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven gave Diana an apologetic smile.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana glared at him angrily, cursing inwardly, "You're all style but no substance. A beast in gentleman's clothing."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their brief eye contact was tense, and the smoke of battle cleared momentarily. Steven furrowed his brows deeply, sensing the depths of Diana's hatred toward him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The police arrived, with officers from both sides present. Queenie and Cecil each insisted on their version of events, so the police took them to the station for further investigation.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana accompanied Cecil downstairs. She whispered, "Cecil, if Queenie dared to call the police on you, it means she's destroyed all your previous evidence. She's well-prepared tonight, so claim she seduced you. I'll find a way to help you. Queenie loves using trending topics to portray herself as a victim. By morning, what happen tonight will be trending.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie's targeting you because your status will create a big scandal and boost her reputation. Jace and Steven will also interfere, so be careful."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil was stunned, realizing Queenie's true intentions. "Diana, thank you! Please take care of Grandma for me. I'll be fine, so don't worry."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had failed to heed her warnings. Diana had repeatedly cautioned him about Queenie, but he still couldn't guard against her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was too cunning.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana gave him a reassuring look, signaling him not to worry.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Diana watched Cecil being taken away, a sense of desolation filled her eyes. Queenie was determined to destroy the Farley family.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Farley family had significant overseas assets. The last time his father went abroad, he nearly got into trouble, and their projects were almost seized.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If the Farley family fell, their overseas projects wouldn't survive.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was this Queenie's ultimate goal?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wanted the drama and to obtain the Foliot family's secrets.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jace liked young women, so he naturally wouldn't overlook Queenie, who matched his preferences in both looks and figure.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seemed she couldn't sit idly by. Surely there were people in the Foliot family who disliked Jace.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Like his granddaughter, Novia.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="335.html">« Prev</a><a href="337.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
