Rest assured. I have ways to deal with Diana. I can make her suffer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Zora hung up the phone with a malicious smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If her son could work in Queenie's company, he could earn a million dollars a year.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At night, Helen got treatment and fell into a deep sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana covered Helen with a blanket and then prepared to go to rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She would treat Helen again in the morning, and her stomachache would be gone. The stomach needed a process to heal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She closed the door gently and saw Zora standing not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Zora said with a smile, "Ms. Bishop, I've already prepared a room on the first floor. Please go downstairs to rest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the first floor? Diana frowned slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It didn't matter where she slept. It was just for one night. She had slept on the first floor when she was here before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It would be tiring to come again in the morning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright." Diana nodded slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven came out of the main bedroom and glared at Zora. "Zora, Diana is my wife. Where are you planning to put her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Zora said with a bit of panic, "Mr. Gellar, when Ms. Bishop accompanied you to visit Madam Gellar in the past, you always let Ms. Bishop stay on the first floor. You said she had no right to stay on the second floor, and only Ms. Marsh was qualified to stay upstairs. Ms. Marsh is your love. Mr. Gellar, I'm just following your orders."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven frowned, recalling that he had indeed said such words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that time... He suddenly raised his eyes and saw the pain in Diana's gaze. He hurriedly went over, but Diana turned and went downstairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was too sad to say a word, feeling a slump in her throat. So that was how it was. She had no right to stay upstairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The malicious Queenie was really a perfect match for Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana went downstairs, grabbed her bag, and left the Gellar Manor. She could come over earlier tomorrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She sent a message to Luna, asking her to come and pick her up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven followed out, grabbing Diana's hand. "Diana, where are you going?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked up and said weakly, "I'm going home. Mr. Gellar, do you need anything else?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing her painful voice, Steven frowned at her, "Don't mind Zora's words. I won't let her say such things again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was speechless. "Steven, those weren't Zora's words. They were yours. I know I'm unworthy, so I'll go back to my house. Please get out of my way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven held her hand tightly. "Diana, what happened before has already happened. I'm sorry. Just don't make a fuss anymore. I said I'll stand by you from now on..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need. You standing by me would bring disaster upon me. Mr. Gellar, I beg you to have mercy and let me go. What you do with Queenie and the Marsh family has nothing to do with me. Moreover, someone as despicable as you don't deserve me. Stay away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shook off his hand forcefully and left the Gellar Manor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven chased after her. Hearing the footsteps, Diana turned sharply and yelled, "Steven, don't follow me anymore! Don't make me hate you even more."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="419.html">« Prev</a><a href="421.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
