She believed that what Steven said at this time was sincere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled. If Steven had said such words before, she would have been so happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Diana loved Steven deeply. She ignored anyone's opinions and dissuasion and even had a fallout with her grandfather and three brothers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when Paula said that she was shameless and stole Queenie's fianc&eacute;, she just laughed it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she recalled it, tears flashed in Diana's eyes. "Steven, do you know how much I loved you before? Paula said a lot of bad things to me. She said I was an ungrateful person who stole Queenie's fianc&eacute;."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At that time, I was actually very sad to hear such words. But I still loved you very much and wanted to be with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to say that I was not an ungrateful person. I did not steal Queenie's fianc&eacute;. It was Queenie who saw that you were disabled and did not want to take care of you, so she fled the country."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you all disappointed me. I stayed by your side and took such good care of you. But as soon as Queenie came back, you abandoned me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You knew I was innocent. I did love you back then, but after you and Queenie were together, I did not think of tearing you two apart. She ran away by herself." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then your grandfather used means to make me be with you. I thought at the time that Queenie was gone. Maybe we still had a chance. Steven, I gave you two years, but you did not give me a chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I had heard this two years ago, I would have been so happy. Now I just think that you feel guilty about me after knowing all the truth. When I love someone, I treat them with all my heart. And when I leave them, no one can change my mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm helping you now only because of our previous friendship. Don't say such things in the future. It will only make me look down on you more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You like Queenie. No matter who she is, no matter what she has done, as long as you like her, you can pursue her. You can pursue her now. There is no need to say these hypocritical words to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's voice was choked and hoarse. She felt that she couldn't talk about the past. There was no warmth in it, only endless pain, which only made her angrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She growled angrily, "Steven, I did everything I could to be with you, even against my grandfather. I broke up with my grandfather and my three brothers for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Despite this, when you hurt me, Tobias would come to help me as soon as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because I fell in love with you, Hubery still refuses to talk to me. Because they all knew you were not a good person. But in my heart, you were the best. You just grew up in a different environment from others and have a cold personality."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Every time you say something unpleasant to me, I comfort myself like this and then take care of you with a smile..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn&rsquo;t keep spilling those words anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never said these to anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now she said these to Steven to tell him that they wouldn&rsquo;t be together again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she met these people, she always thought that everyone in this world was good and there were few bad people. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when she met the Marsh family and Steven, she realized that there was a corner of this world where there were also very scary people, including her biological </span><span>mother</span><span> Paula.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason why Paula came to her was because she felt guilty about what she had done to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's heart sank when he heard her words. Seeing the tears in her eyes, he knew </span><span>he'd lost his chance. But he wasn't about to give up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized the past had caused her so much pain. He never expected she'd risk everything just to get his attention. He had been so wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I won't give up," Steven said with deep emotion, not a hint of doubt in his voice. "You loved me with everything you had, and I'll spend my whole life making it up to you. I won't let you down again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stayed calm as she looked at Steven and smiled, "That's your problem, not mine. We're divorced. We'll have nothing to do with each other from now on. There'll be a better guy for me in the future. I believe true love exists. I'm still young, and I know I'll find him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't going to give up on love just because she'd met one wrong guy. Love was still beautiful to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was jolted by her words. Maybe it was because her love had been so intense, but he couldn't stand the thought of her being with someone else. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a moment of lost control, he grabbed Diana's shoulders and kissed her on the </span><span>lips.Diana</span><span> was stunned. She wanted to open her mouth to speak but failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, it gave him a chance to deepen the kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm..." Diana was disgusted by his sudden attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how she struggled, Steven held her backpack tightly. Later, his big hot hands held her waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The space in the car was too small, and she couldn't escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His kiss became more and more overbearing, and her mouth was full of his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was mad with anxiety. "No..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how she struggled, it was in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was gradually exhausted by his deep kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was injured, and Steven was also injured, but she still couldn't get away from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..." After Diana struggled countless times, Steven reluctantly let her go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven kissed her very devotedly, and her chest ached. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was very satisfied. It turned out that kissing the woman he liked was also a very pleasant thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition to a strange face, Steven was full of a mature aura that women could hardly resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Putting aside his wealth, the face under this mask was already a reason for any woman to want to sleep with him at all costs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Diana was once obsessed with him, like a moth to a flame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lights outside flickered. Steven's deep eyes appeared confused in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were deep and burning. He said sincerely, "Diana, I will not give up on you. The divorce certificate is fake. It was just a show for Queenie and George. That man's name is George, and he is Andrew's biological son."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven changed the subject naturally. He knew Diana very well. No matter how she changed, she was still kind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was slightly surprised. Because of his last sentence, she shifted her attention and asked him, "You know everything?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1029.html">« Prev</a><a href="1031.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
