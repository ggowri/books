"Steven, now that she's relying on Mr. Powell, she speaks so boldly with a backer. Steven, since she doesn't want you anymore, why are you still trying to take her home? Let's go, I'm not eating this dinner. Diana is such a bully; she herself is not well-behaved, yet she wants to frame me and ruin my reputation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander frowned, wanting her to shut up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana, looking at Queenie's affected behavior, couldn't help but laugh. "Tsk, how disgusting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but laugh. "Diana, you're being too subtle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana laughed. "In front of you, I have to be a bit more reserved. I was just really upset earlier."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie glared at the sarcastic Diana, thinking, "I will definitely kill this bitch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Diana dared to leave evidence and scheme against her, just wait until she finishes filming the movie, she will take her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's malicious gaze made Diana feel a chill down her spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her malicious gaze was like a sharp dagger, ready to stab her in the back at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana suddenly smiled and said, "Queenie, I have received your warning, but you also forgot my warning. I told you, I will strike back fiercely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her clear, large eyes, there was a display of resolute determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's eyes blazed with anger, her eyes wide open, and her nose wrinkled in embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana, however, remained smiling, which infuriated Queenie even more, to the point where she wanted to tear her apart. If not for maintaining her own image, she would have really torn Diana's beautiful face first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana, looking at her distorted face, couldn't help but say, "Look at your twisted face; even the thickest foundation can't cover up your dark heart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie shouted, "Diana, do you have to humiliate me like this? You're the one who took Steven from me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Was it me who took him away from you, or did you abandon him? You know very well. Queenie, when he was down and out, you left him, and now that he's successful, you're trying to curry favor with him again," Diana said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if Mr. Gellar is willing to tolerate your shamelessness, I have nothing more to say. But if you cause a scene in front of me again, it won't just be a beating. You should think about the movie you've made; if it can't be released because of your scandal, the loss would amount to several hundred million dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glanced at Steven, who was holding onto him, and said sarcastically, "Of course, no matter what you do, there will always be someone willing to accept you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's deep eyes gazed at her quietly; she was radiant, but the look in her eyes toward him was only filled with hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She really hated him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's brows were tightly knitted, as if his heart was suffering from the pain of a thousand arrows piercing through it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The corners of his mouth slightly drooped. He felt the pain that brought him utter despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven suddenly released Diana's hand; it turned out she hated him, intensely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she loved him, he repeatedly left her to go to Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain she felt back then was just as intense as what he was experiencing now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was him who, time and time again, broke her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana frowned as she looked at her hand, which had turned red from being squeezed. She didn't look at Steven again. Instead, she smiled at Alexander and said, "Alexander, let's go. Let's go home for dinner."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="543.html">« Prev</a><a href="545.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
