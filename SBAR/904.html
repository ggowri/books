She stared at him, confused. "Steven, what are you even talking about? You know that agreement better than I do. Grandma mentioned it to me, but you're the one who signed it. So why are you asking me this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her eyes narrowed as she studied his face. He looked exactly like Steven, but something felt off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His voice hadn't changed, yet the way he spoke was different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A chill ran down her spine. Almost instinctively, she was certain that this man wasn't Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Steven was angry, he was cold and detached but never this hostile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her heart raced with shock, but she didn't let it show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead, her gaze fell to his hands. They seemed identical to Steven's at first glance until she noticed the missing scar on his middle finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her breath caught. Even the injuries didn't match. What should have been on his left hand was now on his right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And then there were the bandages on his forehead. She knew for a fact that Steven hadn't injured his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The more she looked, the clearer it became. Steven had been replaced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No wonder she had slept for three days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She shivered as an inexplicable fear crept over her, one that pulled her back to memories she'd tried to bury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her last life, the man who had killed her wasn't Steven but this man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tears pricked her eyes as she stared at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie, sensing the tension, casually shifted her position, stepping between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, the agreement is real," she said in a soft voice, reminding him of what he should know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His expression darkened as her words jogged his memory. "Diana, that agreement stated everything would be donated to orphanages. How could it have ended up with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana met his gaze head-on, her confusion deepening. But she couldn't tip her hand just yet. "Is that what it said? I never read the contents. You're the one who signed it with Grandpa. You'd know better than me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In truth, she had no idea what the agreement said. She only knew it existed because Helen had once mentioned it in passing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George's eyes darkened further, his silence heavy with tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His gaze locked onto hers, sharp enough to cut, sending an involuntary shiver down her spine, which confirmed again that this man wasn't Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She clenched her fists, willing her voice to steady. "What are you staring at? Careful, or I might just poke your eyes out," she quipped, raising her hand in mock threat. They were divorced now, and the money was in her hands. There was nothing to fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he could finish, Olivia stepped in front of her, blocking his path. "What's your problem? Why are you yelling at her? If anyone's at fault here, it's you! You're the one who signed that agreement. So why are you acting like she owes you an explanation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George's expression hardened, his fists clenching tightly. It felt like everything he'd worked for was slipping through his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana turned to Queenie with a faint smile. "Queenie, Steven, I hope the two of you are very happy together. Oh, and one more thing. About that baby you just aborted? Levi's, wasn't it? You should really slow down. Your uterus isn't exactly in great shape."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, she spun on her heel, feeling an unprecedented sense of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia tugged her toward the door, leaving Queenie standing there, stunned into silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie hadn't expected Diana to still have a trick up her sleeve, even after their divorce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie." George's cold voice cut through the silence like a blade. "Was that child really his?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Panic flashed across her face, but she quickly smoothed her expression. "George, how could you even think that? Diana said that on purpose to get under your skin. Can't you tell?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She spoke with confidence, sure that he wouldn't be able to verify anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But his icy gaze lingered. "Do you think I can't find out? Queenie, I've told you before. I married you because you understood me. I gave you freedom, but don't mistake that for indulgence. Know your limits."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her heart raced as she tried to maintain her composure. "George, you've had three women overseas. Did I ever complain? I swear, I've never done anything to betray you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her voice quivered just enough to sound genuinely hurt. George sighed, his tone softening. "Let's go. We'll figure this out later. For now, it's clear. That old man played us for fools."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George's frustration was palpable. He'd come back to claim everything that belonged to Steven, but now he was empty-handed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie clenched her fists in silent fury as they left, their faces dark with simmering anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Diana got into the car, the tears she had been holding back spilled over uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia glanced at her, surprised. "Diana, what's going on? Weren't you overjoyed about the divorce? Why are you crying now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana wanted to explain that the man she had confronted earlier wasn't actually Steven, but she was worried that revealing too much might put Olivia in danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Through her tears, she forced a weak laugh. "I'm just... I'm just too happy. That's all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia sighed, shaking her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, alright. Enough crying. Let's go home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Olivia drove, Diana caught a glimpse of Queenie and George emerging from a restaurant, arm in arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Taking a shaky breath, Diana stared out of the window, her thoughts a tangled mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Something wasn't adding up, but she couldn't put her finger on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't believe Steven and the man she had confronted earlier were twins. That explanation felt too far-fetched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Closing her eyes, she tried to calm the storm inside her mind. A sudden thought struck her, and she snapped her eyes open, reaching for her phone to call Evan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The line didn't go through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling uneasy, Diana thought of Helen. Turning to Olivia, she said decisively, "Olivia, it's still early. Let's go to the Gellar Manor. I want to check on the old lady."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was still worried about Helen. Although they had dealt with the butler earlier, there were still others lurking in the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia smiled, trying to ease the tension. "Sure, but relax. My gut tells me the old lady's fine. If anyone's in trouble, it's probably you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana chuckled despite herself. Olivia clearly didn't understand how dangerous the fake Steven truly was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll be fine," Diana assured her. Wiping her tears away, she straightened up. This wasn't the time to wallow in fear or self-pity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Pulling out her phone, she sent a message to Luna, asking her to investigate the hospital's surveillance footage and find any information related to Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She urged her to be cautious, emphasizing the potential danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Luna replied to her, Diana finally relaxed a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia, watching her from the corner of her eye, frowned slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn't shake the feeling that something was seriously wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>About forty minutes later, they arrived at the manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before they could even step fully inside, Andrew's furious voice rang out from the living room. "Mom! I'm your son, and Steven is your grandson. But you handed everything over to Diana? Do you even consider us family anymore?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana paused in the doorway, her gaze snapping toward the commotion inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From where she stood, she could see Queenie, the fake Steven, and Andrew all gathered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But what struck her most was the absence of Evan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Standing quietly near the door, Diana and Olivia strained to hear the conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Helen's voice was calm but carried a hint of steel as she addressed George. "Steven, when your grandfather asked you to sign that agreement years ago, you agreed without hesitation. So why are you and your father questioning me about it now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her sharp eyes scanned George, lingering on him with growing doubt. She couldn't quite put her finger on it, but something about him felt off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had raised Steven herself and knew him better than anyone. Since his car accident, he had seemed different, like a stranger wearing her grandson's face. And now, she was beginning to suspect she might be right.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="903.html">« Prev</a><a href="905.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
