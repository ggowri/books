"Jeff, I've already cut ties with your family. Why can't you just leave me alone? You always plan to ruin me in front of others. What exactly have I done to wrong your family?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What nonsense are you talking about? You've always been malicious. I smelled perfume as soon as I walked in, so someone must've set me up. And you're always scheming against Queenie anyway, so it's natural I'd suspect you," Jeff insisted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jeff, you keep plotting against me and then blaming me for it. Maybe I should show everyone here how Queenie seduces men. I have a video. How about I let everyone enjoy it during Mr. Foliot's birthday banquet?" Diana retorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, why are you always targeting me?" Queenie cried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana frowned, looking at Queenie with disdain. "This is Mr. Foliot's house, his banquet. Why are you crying here?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Aren't you just bringing bad luck? Weren't you the one who kept crying and insisting that I was scheming against you?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's you who's been targeting me all along, and now that the evidence is here, you're trying to turn it on me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"With so many people watching, you're talking so smoothly. Did you at least wipe your mouth after using the restroom?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And Mr. Foliot is turning seventy. There's only one-seventieth birthday in a person's life. Couldn't you have cleared your eyes before accusing someone?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just because of our petty grudges, you had to ruin Mr. Foliot's birthday banquet? You can see how much he cares about you from his eyes. Is this how you repay him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Didn't they always like to use power to suppress her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now she'd use their own tactics against them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was cunning, but she really couldn't out-argue Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana used to be silent, even when Queenie framed her. But after so many times, she had finally learned to fight back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, we only suspected you because you disappeared earlier. We didn't say it was definitely you. Why are you trying to ruin my relationship with Mr. Foliot..." Queenie tried to defend herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Have I ever needed to ruin your relationship? You treat everyone like fools.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"God spread wisdom worldwide, but you were holding an umbrella. Even outsiders can see this scheme, let alone someone as sharp as Mr. Foliot," Diana remarked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's little tricks might fool the oblivious, but others would definitely see through them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Foliot, I didn't..." Queenie tried to explain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Enough, stop talking. You all should leave now," Jace said angrily, looking at Queenie before turning away. His angry gaze was filled with more disappointment than anything else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie watched Jace leave in anger, feeling furious herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd soon followed, leaving only Diana and a few others behind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff was furious. "You ungrateful girl! How could you be so vicious, ruining Queenie's relationship with Mr. Foliot?" he yelled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was speechless, looking at Jeff's angry face. How could someone like him be her biological father?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her eyes filled with hatred. "How could I have your blood running through my veins? I wish I'd never come into this world. You're filthy," Diana spat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How is it my fault? Weren't you the ones who ruined it yourselves?" Diana countered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff and Queenie's lips tightened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's eyes were icy as she looked at Queenie. "Queenie, remember what I said when I left that night? I won't let you bully me anymore. However you hurt me, I'll strike back just as hard," she declared.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="202.html">« Prev</a><a href="204.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
