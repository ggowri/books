She then turned to Queenie, her eyes pleading. "Queenie, I've heard your show's predicted to be a big hit. With all the money you'll earn, won't you help me? After so many years of raising you, I need your support. My company has lost over a hundred key partners, and I have no idea who's behind this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued, "After they pulled their investments, I was forced to take out loans. I didn't want to worry any of you, so I kept it quiet. But now, even more investors have pulled out, and someone has bought out my company at a steal. I've managed to patch up some of the holes, but I'm still buried under a mountain of debt&mdash;a billion, to be exact."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula grasped Queenie's hand with a desperate look. "Queenie, you must help me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's lips curled into a cold smile. She'd been waiting for this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she knew the old couple of the Barnes family still held a considerable fortune in their hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, sure, acting pays, but the film isn't even finished yet. Who knows if it'll be a success? Besides, any money I have is thanks to the allowance you give me. I don't have the funds to pay off that kind of debt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what, Queenie had to wrest every bit of wealth from the Barnes family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once she threw them out, her family would finally reunite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was perfect&mdash;her years of planning had finally paid off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula paused, looking at Queenie with tear-filled eyes. "Queenie, I raised you for so many years. I even sent my own daughter away just to make you happy. And now, you won't do me this small favor? One billion should be easy for you to secure. Don't you know Jace Foliot? Ask him to help us clear this debt, and our family can make a fresh start. Trust me, dear; I'll make sure you live well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was stunned, realizing just how desperate Paula had become to make such a request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trust her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd rather trust herself&mdash;she knew she could make a good life for herself on her own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those investors who left Paula? They'd all been poached by Queenie, after years of careful planning, just for this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trying to appear sympathetic, she replied, "Mom, of course, I want to help you. I appreciate all you've done for me over the years. But truly, I don't have the funds right now. I'll be here with you to get through this, I promise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula's stomach churned as she listened, nearly sick with disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This girl&mdash;how hadn't she noticed before just how vile she could be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A spark of rage glinted in her downcast eyes; once she got rid of these parasites, she could bring Diana back into her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie, mistaking Paula's silence for sorrow, went on. "I'm not as cold as Diana, who just walked away without a second thought for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feigning surprise, Queenie added, "Oh, speaking of her, that reminds me! Yesterday, while I was having lunch with Steven, I overheard a chat between him and Mr. Powell. It seems Diana isn't the country bumpkin we thought. Apparently, she has a brother who's pretty wealthy. He's partnered with Mr. Powell on a project and handed over the shares to her&mdash;they're set to make a few billion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you serious, Queenie?" Jeff's eyes immediately lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Diana had money, he'd make sure she handed it over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course, Dad. Why would I lie about this? Diana is Mom's daughter&mdash;she's bound to help her."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="551.html">« Prev</a><a href="553.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
