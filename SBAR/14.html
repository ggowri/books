This time, he wanted to make her convinced.</p><p>Diana had just finished talking to Luna when her cell phone rang again.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Seeing it was Steven calling again, Diana got annoyed.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In the past, he had often not answered when she called him. And she used to answer it at once when he called her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">How could that humble love win his respect?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana smiled, thinking, &quot;Steven, I will treat you the same way you treated me before.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She threw her phone aside and let it ring freely.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her reason could really suppress her inappropriate emotions when she refused to fall in love.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven called Diana several times, but no one answered.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His handsome face was cold and sinister. &quot;Diana, you are getting more and more daring. How dare you not answer my call?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">When Queenie, who had chased him out, heard this, the jealousy in her eyes was about to overflow.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She thought, &quot;Why does he still call Diana?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Steven, are you leaving?&quot; asked Queenie gently.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She was reluctant to let him go.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven was in a bad mood. The thought of Diana having left with that man and even asked for a hug affectionately made him unable to sleep well in the past few days.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I have something else to do, so I&#x27;ll go back first. Go in.&quot; Steven&#x27;s voice was low and dull.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie heard something wrong.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But Steven had already strode away.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She gritted her teeth and looked at Steven&#x27;s back, feeling that he had changed.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Why did she feel like she was going to lose him even though he and Diana were divorced? A trace of panic inexplicably flashed through Queenie&#x27;s heart.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She thought, &quot;Diana, you are doomed this time.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">After three days of recovery, Diana was finally able to walk again.</p><p style="text-align:left;">During these three days, Paula had called her every day to ask for a date, but she refused.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As for Steven, she completely blocked him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana thought, &quot;Why does Steven keep calling me instead of going to find Queenie?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie only loves his money. The &#x27;luckiest&#x27; thing in Steven&#x27;s life is meeting Queenie.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">After her divorce, Diana no longer had to get up early and go to bed late to take care of Steven. Now, she could sleep until she woke up naturally.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She thought, &quot;From now on, I would rather be a bad person hated by everyone than a good person bullied by everyone.</p><p style="text-align:left;">I was such an idiot before. I didn&#x27;t enjoy my leisurely and comfortable life and chose to go to Steven to be bullied.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In the end, he pushed me down the stairs, making me and my baby dead.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In this life, I realize that there is nothing wrong with human nature. The only problem is that I am not strong enough.</p><p style="text-align:left;">There is only the strong and the weak in the world. Where is the compassion and love?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Speaking of which, my cooperation with the Marsh family and the Gellar family has been cut off for a week.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Why do they have no movement?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana tilted her head and counted the days. It would not be long before Gale&#x27;s legs would be crippled. In her previous life, she had reminded Gale that there was something wrong with his car.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But Gale had scolded her, saying that she was insane and only hoped that something would happen to him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He had also said that she was not like Queenie at all, always thinking about him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In this life, she would remind him again. Whether he could escape depended on his luck.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana washed up and went downstairs to make breakfast for Leopold. She walked in a skipping manner and hummed her favorite songs.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Leopold just walked and saw her happy back. A loving smile appeared on his old face, and his eyes were moist. The little girl he had raised was really back.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Tobias was very busy and hadn&#x27;t been home for three days.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She made sandwiches and oat milk for breakfast. Leopold liked them very much. After breakfast, he went to the park to dance with the women at his age.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He said he would find a wife again.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana was stunned and didn&#x27;t answer him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Then, Diana received another call from Paula.</p><p style="text-align:left;">This time, Diana did not refuse. The two made an appointment to meet at the Sunshine Club.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana packed up and went to meet Paula.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In the luxurious box, there was a pot of Phalaenopsis on the marble table, which was blooming beautifully.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In Diana&#x27;s eyes, her life had never been as beautiful as this pot of Phalaenopsis.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula was beautiful, sitting elegantly on the sofa. Seeing that Diana was in good condition, she became angry when she thought about how she had been tortured for more than three months. &quot;Diana, are you going to destroy my happy family before you give up?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="13.html">« Prev</a><a href="15.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
