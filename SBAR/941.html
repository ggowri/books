He felt his back stiffen as he sat on the chair, staring blankly at the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nightmares haunted him&mdash;excruciating pain, his body torn apart, the sight of himself barely clinging to life. The icy water, the biting wind, the agony in his chest, and the searing physical torment&mdash;each memory gnawed at him relentlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those dreams were too horrifying. Every time Cecil woke up, he was drenched in cold sweat. Yet, here he was, alive and well. He had come to understand something </span><span>profound, it's never reasoning that changes a person, but the hard-hitting lessons learned when they hit rock bottom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meeting Diana had been a turning point, like a jolt to his soul. He felt more clear-headed than ever now. As long as he could stop Queenie, that venomous woman, from succeeding, he believed he'd live a long life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil laughed bitterly, the distant look in his eyes sharpening with resolve. "Queenie, so you've gone back in time too, huh? But you missed your window of opportunity. I survived the day I was supposed to die. This time, the one who loses will always be you, Queenie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words "gone back in time" hit Queenie like a hammer to the chest. A strange thought flickered in her mind, "In my dreams, there was that faint, pleading voice. What was it begging for again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice was distant, muffled, and filled with pain. She couldn't make out the words clearly, but certain phrases stood out, "child" and "lover," repeated over and over. It made her realize something horrifying&mdash;those dreams weren't just figments of her imagination. They were memories of things that had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie stumbled back a few steps, staring at Cecil's smug, defiant face. "Cecil, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil couldn't be sure if she, too, had remembered the past. But judging by the shift in her expression, something about her had changed. Her gaze was darker and more sinister now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie suddenly burst into laughter so hard that tears rolled down her cheeks. "Cecil, if what you're saying is true, then the one who wins will always be me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "If Diana hadn't ruined my plan, Cecil would've been on my side against her by now. I had to say, he's much easier to use than Samuel ever was."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil quickly grabbed his phone and sent Diana a message: [Diana, I think Queenie might be remembering the past too. She just told me to die a slow, agonizing death, and I noticed her expression and presence have completely changed.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How would he know, you may wonder? Well, because he had been through the same thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Diana was already being wheeled into the elevator at Wyatt's company. When she saw Cecil's message, she didn't feel much of anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Diana, it made sense&mdash;if she could go back in time and Cecil could remember fragments of their past lives, then it wasn't surprising that Queenie could, too. What intrigued Diana more was why this had all happened in the first place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana replied: [Don't worry. She's already running on fumes. Let her try to act strong; we'll just wait for her to overplay her hand. Everything in this world follows a natural order. She's done too much evil, and karma will catch up with her.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reading her message, Cecil could tell she had another plan in mind. Still, he wasn't as hopeful as she was. The truth was, he dreaded pain more than anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He returned to the chat window and immediately saw the news that Samuel had been released and cleared of murder charges.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The screen displayed a trending hashtag, "Samuel Farley's murder charge was a misunderstanding&mdash;it was all a plot to take over the Farley family's business and </span><span>manipulate public opinion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One comment read: [Who could be so awful? Samuel's my fave!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another wrote: [He's just another spoiled rich kid. Why are you hyping him up?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil didn't bother scrolling through the comments. Instead, his attention lingered on Diana's swift efficiency, and his eyes softened with a gentle warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Wyatt and said, "Uncle Wyatt, about Samuel's alleged murder, the truth is out. He didn't kill anyone. He's already been released and should be arriving at the company soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie clenched her fists tightly and grumbled inwardly, "Samuel lied to me. Damn him. Knowing his impulsive nature, he really could've killed Diana."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard the person Samuel supposedly killed was Diana?" she asked cautiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Cecil could answer, Diana's cold voice rang out from the doorway. "That's right. The person he wanted to kill was me. But after I talked to him, he changed his mind. He didn't kill me. And guess what, Queenie? I'm alive and kicking&mdash;plenty of room for you to throw another tantrum."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie snapped her head toward the door. Diana was sitting in a wheelchair. Her icy demeanor, striking appearance, and top-tier looks filled Queenie with envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna then pushed Diana into the room. Diana hadn't died. Queenie had considered the possibility before, but she didn't dwell on it. After all, Queenie figured that if she played her cards right, she could still wrest control of Wyatt's company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last time, Queenie had helped Wyatt scheme against Cecil to ensure Cecil wouldn't support him again. Yet Cecil had shown up anyway. Her expression darkened as she thought furiously, "Samuel dared to lie to me. He's so dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a mocking smile, she sneered, "Diana, so you're alive. Since you're not dead, why did you report Samuel and cause the Farley Group's stock to tank?" She deliberately twisted the story, her smile sinister as she stared at Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes locked onto Queenie's dark gaze, and a thought flickered in her mind, "She has changed... Could it be..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana chuckled and shot back. "You were the one who reported Samuel. I let him go, so why did you feel the need to report him?" Her smile was so radiant it seemed to melt the winter chill outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's breath hitched. She hated Diana's radiant, captivating presence. Without a word, she turned to George for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George, however, was at a loss. The Farley family controlled billions of dollars in assets. For now, there was no way they could take them on head-to-head. Their best option was to bide their time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he gave Queenie a subtle shake of his head. Frustration clouded her face. She knew that with Cecil involved, the situation had become much more complicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was then Diana finally noticed George. Honestly, he didn't have the commanding presence of Steven. Wherever Steven went, no matter how crowded the room, he always stood out. By comparison, George seemed far less noticeable. When she first entered, all her attention had gone to the roguishly charming Cecil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said with a smirk, "Oh, Mr. Gellar, you're here too. Your tactics are getting dirtier, aren't they? Targeting a small company like Mr. Wyatt Farley's? That's not </span><span>something you would ever stoop to, Steven."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George's eyes turned icy. Her words hit a nerve. "Diana," he snapped, "you schemed to take over the Gellar family's assets, and you still dare to say things like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had no patience for his whining. "Zip it already. You're nothing but a sore loser. And all you ever do is bark like a dog&mdash;it's getting old."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You&mdash;" George's handsome face twisted with anger. Her flawless skin and stunning features were dazzling, but that sharp tongue of hers made him want to rip her to shreds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Samuel's voice came from outside the door. "Dad, I'm here." The moment Queenie heard his voice, her face went pale. She was shocked that he had been released so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel burst into the room, looking disheveled and out of breath. When he saw Diana and Cecil, relief washed over him, and he called out happily, "Cecil! Diana!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie immediately tried to assert control, snapping, "Samuel, don't forget&mdash;you were working with me before. What the hell are you doing now?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="940.html">« Prev</a><a href="942.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
