Steven asked with furrowed brows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric spotted Steven and got excited. "Steven, you came to save me! Did Queenie send you? She's always been the kindest to me, unlike some ungrateful backstabbers."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana turned to Eric with a mocking smile. "Eric, I left your family a card to repay everything I used. While I lived with you all, you did nothing but bully me. You've got some nerve calling me ungrateful."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric was stunned, speechless. It was true that Diana always wore Queenie's hand-me-downs at their house. Although to be fair, Diana rarely wore those clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because Diana came from the countryside, the Marsh family feared she would embarrass them. Everyone treated her poorly. On top of that, she was malicious and always tried to frame Queenie. Everyone in the Marsh family despised her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana turned to Steven with contempt. "Well, I won't keep you from saving your precious Queenie's brother."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven spat through gritted teeth. "I'm not here to save him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh!" Diana was genuinely surprised. "Won't your sweetheart cry if you don't help Eric?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, why do you have to be so damn sarcastic?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana laughed. "Mr. Gellar, I'm just telling it like it is. Eric brought me here to hand me over to those men. He told them they could do whatever they wanted as long as they didn't kill me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven, you and the Marsh family are all cut from the same cloth. You expect me to play nice? Keep dreaming, you son of a bitch."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without another word, Diana walked around Steven, hopped into a red sports car parked nearby, and sped off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric wasn't about to let his meal ticket slip away. He shouted desperately, "Steven, help me! Please, save me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven had heard everything. The Marsh family wasn't just wrong - they were pure evil.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He'd been stubborn before, blind to both sight and reason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But with the thought of Queenie and the person behind her, Steven knew he couldn't afford to alienate the Marsh family completely. So, he saved Eric.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After being rescued, Eric grinned happily. "Steven, Queenie called you, I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's kick sent Eric flying across the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone stood there stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ouch..." Eric was dazed. He looked at Steven in agony. "Steven... why did you hit me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven looked at him coldly. "Eric, I thought you just had a nasty mouth. I didn't realize you were an actual demon. Do you want to offer Diana to those people? They can do whatever they want as long as they don't kill her. Even a stranger wouldn't say something so vile, let alone family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You just wait. Once I sort this mess out, you'll pay for what you said today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven turned and walked away without another word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric, terrified by Steven's ruthlessness, sobbed, "I... I was just joking."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elroy turned to Eric and said, "Eric, we don't welcome scumbags like you in our circle. Diana's under my protection now. If you try to bully her around here, you'll have me to answer to."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The gang swaggered back to their car and drove off, leaving Eric standing there like a deer in headlights.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He sat there shivering with cold, his body aching all over. "That troublemaker Diana," he thought bitterly, "I won't let her get away with this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, a thought struck him. "Wait a minute...where did she get fifty million dollars?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="442.html">« Prev</a><a href="444.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
