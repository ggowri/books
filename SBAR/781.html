If your feelings for me don't return to how they once were, I'll agree to the divorce," Steven said, knowing he had only a year to change her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could make Diana fall in love with him again within that time, they could grow old together.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A year was plenty for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana understood the agreement Edward had signed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always wondered why he would sign such a contract.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Steven cared about the money.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't want to discuss it further; she could wait a year.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Steven present, she couldn't finalize the divorce on her own.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, I'm young; I can wait," she said, smiling triumphantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing her agreement, Steven sighed in relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing breakfast, Steven explained, "I'll be in a meeting on the top floor soon. Here's a card; you can use it to enjoy the facilities."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "No need for special treatment. It's too late for me to enjoy being your wife. I don't need it anymore. I can earn my own money, and I won't touch your belongings or your money to avoid complications during the divorce.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've already given me the one hundred million dollars for medical expenses. I'm doing fine now, and we're even. I don't want to owe you anything," Diana insisted, firmly rejecting him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She really didn't want to have anything to do with this man anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven tightened his grip on the card, looking down coldly at her. "But you're still my wife..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How strange. You never let me say I'm your wife before, and now you're calling me that. Stop disgusting me. We'll just coexist peacefully for this year as you promised we'd get a divorce afterward."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana picked up her things and turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven watched her go, feeling helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bitterly smiled to himself. Perhaps this was his punishment. A man like him didn't deserve love!</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snapped the card in half.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pain washed over him, and he closed his eyes, feeling the deep ache in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, it's time for the morning meeting," Evan called from the doorway.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," Steven replied, his voice low.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he went to work, Diana met up with Althea and Paige to have fun.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They went to play games in the Sky City on the fifth floor, where Althea had bought all-access passes. The three had a great time.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hours later, Diana headed to the dance area, where several young men were breakdancing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea nudged her. "Diana, go on! This is your favorite!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana handed her phone to Althea, eager to join in since she could dance. "Hold this for me; I'm going to jump in for a bit."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea beamed. "Go, go! It's been ages since I've seen you dance. I can't wait to watch you breakdance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at the energetic young men and women dancing and quickly shed her jacket.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wore a fitted white long-sleeve top and loose black pants, perfect for dancing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she entered, Althea and Paige whipped out their phones to record.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few young men spotted the beautiful Diana and whistled with delight.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="780.html">« Prev</a><a href="782.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
