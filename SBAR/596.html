The moment they started talking about work, she had almost forgotten everything he had done before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she quickly snapped back to reality, her tone serious. "Mr. Gellar, my affairs have nothing to do with you. I won't be working with you. You're too cunning. I want to partner with someone I can trust, and I don't trust you. So, there will be no collaboration."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's stance was clear. The project had reached a mature stage; if not for the time she wasted supporting Steven, it would have been on the market a year ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Micah was back, she was finally able to prioritize this project again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was completely disillusioned with Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every bit of passion she once had for him was long gone, leaving only disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven studied her for a moment, then asked with a hint of a smile, "So, who is it that you trust the most? Alexander?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded, openly admitting, "Yes, I trust him. I've spent time with him, and I can see he's a decent man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's anger flared. It dawned on him that Diana thought Alexander was trustworthy while he was not.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still couldn't figure out how she knew about Queenie's dealings with others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes, it felt like Diana had a way of knowing things before they happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, did I ever tell you that I would never divorce you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can only work with me. No one else but me will partner with you on this project," he declared, his voice firm and commanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's frustration boiled over. "Steven, what is your problem? You've tried to divorce me countless times before. Now that I've finally agreed, you don't want a divorce? What exactly do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've changed my mind. I don't want a divorce now. Diana, everyone makes mistakes. I was wrong before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should reconsider the partnership. I take business seriously, and I always play fair," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven stood up, his tall figure casting a shadow over Diana. "I'm going to take a shower."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana frowned, finding his behavior both hypocritical and rude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't believe for a second that he was as honest in business as he claimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew what kind of tactics he used in his dealings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she found it incredibly disrespectful that he would even think of showering in her house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glared at him. "Steven, this is my house. Why do you want to shower here? Go back to your own home. How can you be so shameless? Have you suddenly forgotten who your beloved is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Diana, his behavior was simply appalling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he was the one who had initiated the divorce. But now that she agreed, he refused to let her go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven took off his coat and laid it on the sofa. He spoke slowly, almost casually, "If you won't come back home with me, then I'll stay here. Have you ever heard of a married couple living apart?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shameless!" Diana couldn't help but laugh in exasperation. "Steven, you really have no shame. You still dare to call us a couple? I don't want you anymore, so leave already. Or should I call Queenie to come pick you up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's brow furrowed. Seeing nothing but cold indifference in her eyes made him angry. "Diana, didn't you once say you loved me? Is this how you show your love?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fists clenched tightly. He could still remember how much she used to love him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back then, she would be overjoyed just to have him come home for dinner. She would even wait by the door to welcome him.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="595.html">« Prev</a><a href="597.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
