"This is Steven's territory."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige nodded. "That must be it."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea thought, "Of course it's his territory!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Diana in danger? Steven looks really angry."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea was worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Concern creased Paige's brow. Diana often faced bullying from Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing Diana's phone was with her, Althea felt even more anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paige, we need to check on her. If Steven hurts Diana, we can help. Her phone is with me, so if she needs to call for help, she won't be able to."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige felt the urgency and replied, "Okay, let's go find her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the elevator doors opened, they rushed toward Diana's room.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige tapped rapidly on the door, but there was no response.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea felt like crying, tears welling in her eyes. "What if she's somewhere else? What if she hasn't come back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been too hurried to notice where Steven might have taken Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige leaned against the door, trying to reassure Althea. "It's okay, it's okay. Steven wouldn't dare hurt her. In the last two times I saw him, he seemed to care about Diana."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea scoffed, "His affection is worthless now."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana found herself in Steven's room.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She struggled against his iron grip, wincing as he squeezed her wrist. "Steven, why did you bring me here? Let me go; my hand hurts."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at her with a smile that didn't quite reach his eyes, his anger simmering beneath the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I can't believe you dance so well."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had watched her dance the whole time, mesmerized. Since she left, every time he saw her, she was more captivating than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her connect so perfectly with that boy had ignited a spark of jealousy in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was an excellent driver, a skilled healer, a talented designer, and now an amazing dancer&mdash;what else had she hidden from him?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was she really just a country girl?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No. The last time he met Leopold, the man had seemed ordinary, but his wise eyes spoke of a lifetime of experience&mdash;definitely not an average person.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn't help but laugh at his frustration. How was it that he could be upset about her dancing with someone else while he sought out other women?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You never pay attention to my life or what I do every day. Of course, you wouldn't know that I can dance! I don't just do street dance; I can also do jazz and Latin..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She counted on her fingers but lost interest, feeling deflated as she plopped onto the couch.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice lowered. "Steven, we agreed this morning&mdash;one year and then we'll divorce, each living our own lives. How can you interrupt my chance to find a cute guy? Do you know what my grandfather's dream is? To surround me with a hundred handsome men, each ready to serve me every day."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="782.html">« Prev</a><a href="784.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
