It had just healed, but was acting up again due to his overworking.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had long since blocked Steven's number.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Didn't expect this poor soul would have a reason to seek her out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She decided not to make things difficult for Evan.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go to my former room. There's a medical kit in the second drawer of the bedside table. Take it out. You'll find all the medications your boss needs within."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There are stomach medicines, pain relievers for his legs, and eye drops. If he's been straining his eyes, use the pink eye drops. I prepared them in daily doses. He only needs to use one per day."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan was excited, knowing that Diana still cared so much about his boss. "Okay, I see, Ms. Bishop. When will you be back by the way?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What is wrong with that guy?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How could he still not understand the situation?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They've divorced. She will never go back again."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Evan, I'm divorced from your boss and won't be coming back. Take good care of him for me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana hung up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wanted revenge, but was no match for Steven right now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was wise to placate him for now and deal with Queenie first.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana turned off her phone. She wouldn't feel sorry for Steven even if he died of illness right now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Humph! Scumbag. Shame on you to remember me when you're in pain! It's too late."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana turned off the light and went to sleep.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm too rich to feel upset. Haha.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Time for me to get my sleep!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I mean nothing to that guy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, his situation has nothing to do with me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At Steven's home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan had finished the call.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He dared not speak, as his boss could hear everything.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven hadn't been eating properly these past few days. His stomach was hurting badly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana would always bring him medicine whenever he suffered stomachache before and he recovered quickly after taking it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the past, whenever he fell ill, Diana would rush to his company with great worry to deliver medicine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, she merely asked Evan to do it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven sat motionlessly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His finely chiseled face was covered in shadows, the loss in his eyes quite obvious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He finally said hoarsely, "You go boil some water. I'll get the medical kit."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Somehow, he didn't want others to go into Diana's room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, sir." Evan scurried off to the kitchen. It felt stuffy around this man. He wanted to leave here soon after getting everything done.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was beyond Evan's power to handle all this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan also had ordered oatmeal for Steven. He needed to eat something.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This man was a scumbag, but to some degree, was a good boss.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He worked very diligently. Since Diana left, he had secured several projects.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the price was that his wife had left him for good.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan often wanted to mock Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But finally gave up thinking about his annual salary.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the second floor, in Diana's room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven sat on the bed, feeling awful. His stomachache was particularly severe today.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes beneath his jet-black brows were tightly closed, his thin lips and face pale.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After resting for a while, he struggled to fetch the medical kit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The white medical kit was beautiful.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He carried it downstairs, his stomach churning. Ever since Diana started taking care of him, he hadn't experienced such a heavy stomachache.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As short as four months since she left, his gastritis actually began acting up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan placed the ordered oatmeal in front of Steven after he came downstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, eat some oatmeal before taking the medicine. It'll take effect much sooner with your stomach filled. The taste is excellent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I remember Ms. Bishop bought one especially after knowing you like it and since then often cooked you such oatmeal."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's stomach was in severe pain. Hearing Evan's words, he missed Diana even more.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His face grew increasingly pale, his porcelain-like skin accentuating his sharp, cold features. With great pain flickering in his eyes, Steven lowered his head to sip the oatmeal with a spoon. Sure enough, the one cooked by Diana tasted better.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even with the warm oatmeal in his stomach, the churning pain persisted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan knew well how to persuade Steven seeing him put down the spoon. "Mr. Gellar, Ms. Bishop said you must take all of it for the medicine to work."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven glanced at him indifferently with his sharp eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan smiled, trying to make his boss eat a bit more with his encouraging eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven silently lowered his head to continue eating.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How obedient!" Evan thought.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven reached for the medical kit after finishing taking the oatmeal, and happened to see a note stuck to the lid.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>[</span><span>May my husband stay healthy and never need to take these medicines again.</span><span>]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was stunned.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="97.html">« Prev</a><a href="99.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
