Diana never grew up in the countryside. In fact, she grew up in a family even better than the Marsh family. We've all been fooled by Diana."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was unwilling, thinking, "Why should I be despised by everyone while Diana lives so well? She doesn't even have to do anything, and the wealth she has now is enough for several lifetimes."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's wealth I could never have in my lifetime. She's already so rich. Why does she still want to take Steven's company? Diana really doesn't know when to stop. She's too greedy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, you clearly grew up in such a wealthy family. After coming back, why did you say you grew up in the countryside to gain everyone's sympathy?" Queenie's voice was on the verge of breaking. She was so angry that her back tensed up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was speechless, thinking, "When did I ever say I was from the countryside? They were the ones who assumed that."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She raised an eyebrow, a faint smile in her eyes. "Queenie, I never said I grew up in the countryside. It was you who assumed that. I grew up on an island, a secluded little island."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I trained and studied there, then went abroad to study. But if I told you, would you believe me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As if struck, Queenie couldn't help but take a few steps back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "Yes, Gale did bring her back from the countryside at that time. So, we all assumed she grew up in the countryside."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana continued, "Even if I told the truth, has anyone ever believed me? In your eyes, I have no background. You are arrogant and conceited, always thinking you're superior, above everyone else. You've humiliated me in front of others time and again. But I never cared."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I never deliberately hid anything from you. It's just that you only see yourselves and ignore others. Is that my fault?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie turned and left in anger. She came to give Diana a gift just to humiliate her. But she never expected that in the end, the one embarrassed would be herself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, the one with no background is Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After stepping out, Queenie saw a familiar figure not far away. She gave a cold smile, then strode off, even forgetting about George.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before leaving, George cast a cold glance at Steven, who was sitting beside Diana. It was an unfamiliar face. However, the strong aura emanating from him felt vaguely familiar.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Who is this man? When did such a man appear by Diana's side? He's even sitting next to her. Could he be the man Diana found?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Actually, ever since meeting Steven, George had been eagerly waiting for Diana to come to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's love for Steven was wholehearted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her love for Steven was passionate and obsessive. Even while George was abroad, he knew how Diana cared for Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was incredibly lucky. Despite going through those things as a child, like a demon in the dark, he still found a woman who loved him wholeheartedly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made George very jealous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Diana never reached out to him, not even once.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George was deeply unwilling. "Diana, wasn't I the one you loved the most? How can you not love me anymore now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was startled because there seemed to be a different emotion in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Diana quickly leaned closer to the real Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven naturally put his arm around her shoulder, claiming his territory.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "Steven, we are already divorced. A proper ex should be like they're dead. Also, stop pretending. The person I loved most was indeed you, but the one you love now is Queenie. You always wanted me to let you two be together, and I already did. But why are you showing that expression?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She deliberately glared at him angrily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Slightly stunned, George looked at the man behind him. "Who is he?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana suddenly looked at Steven, then smiled and explained sincerely, "I forgot to introduce him to you. After our divorce, I found my true soulmate. He is my fianc&eacute;. So, you can rest assured from now on. I absolutely won't interfere with you and Queenie."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George's expression was terrible. He gave her a cold glare and said, "Diana, I don't believe you can forget me. Since you don't like this bracelet, I'll buy you a diamond bracelet another day."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was stunned, thinking, "What the fuck! What's going on? Did he really put himself into Steven's role?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at Steven with some fear. "What's wrong with him?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her deeply and said, "He's fallen for you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was stunned, then softly said, "Can you not talk? If you can't talk properly, just don't say anything."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "George likes me? How could Steven have such an idea? I wouldn't even dare to think that."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold suddenly asked in shock, "Sweet pea, when did you get a boyfriend? Why didn't I know?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana quickly explained, "Grandpa, just now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias and Julius were also stunned. They had been busy dealing with Steven and Queenie just now, so they didn't notice there was a stranger sitting here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias and Julius looked at Steven with unfriendly eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the lights, Steven's gaze remained cold. He looked at Tobias and Julius and said, "Hello. We'll be family from now on."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias and Julius were stunned, not knowing what to say.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Tobias quickly said, "Don't say that. You haven't passed our evaluation yet. You have a good face, but your character still needs to be assessed. Diana is outstanding. If your character doesn't measure up, you won't be part of our family."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was at this moment that Steven realized he was not worthy of Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold directly gave her a $10 billion deposit, and each of his three brothers was extremely generous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These hidden tycoons were very low-key. No wonder Diana had always been so modest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold gave Steven a meaningful look. Then, he glanced at Diana. After that, he smiled and said, "Alright, what just happened was just a little episode. Let's eat first. After dinner, we'll sing the birthday song. Since we've already given the gifts, after we finish the cake, let's head to the bar. I'll get you twenty go-go dancers."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was furious, thinking, "Does this old man not see me sitting right here? Why does he always order go-go dancers for my wife every time he sees her? Does he think my wife is that desperate for men?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana, who was drinking water, almost choked because of Leopold.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Leopold, Diana was very puzzled. "Grandpa, why are you so fixated on this go-go dancer thing?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold was also confused and replied, "Weren't you always saying you wanted to have lots of men? Last time, I found twenty men for you, but you didn't like any of them. This time, I searched nationwide&mdash;there's every type you can think of. Plus, they're all over 6.07 feet tall and very strong."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana widened her eyes at Leopold, then blinked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then she asked, "Grandpa, why are you looking for very strong men?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1073.html">« Prev</a><a href="1075.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
