It was because no matter how much she had cared about Steven before, he had been unwilling to appreciate it and hadn't needed her care.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She picked up the phone beside her and checked the time. Then, she sent a message to Nolan.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Nolan, I'll come to you later. Please show me the design. I've calculated the funds on hand. We can do it ourselves without any investment.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the resort in Luspus was developed, it would be a sure-win business.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had seen the intelligent medical system. Steven was capable, but she didn't want to be too involved with him. So, she had to find Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The USB drive was still in Steven's hands. So, she called Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after Steven drove away from the villa, he saw Diana calling him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He parked the car on the roadside and answered the phone in a good mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, is there something wrong?" His voice was gentle.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana asked, "Where is the USB drive you took last time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven said, "I will talk to you about this matter when I come back tonight. If you want to find a partner, you can cooperate with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want to cooperate with you. I want to cooperate with Alexander." Diana thought of Alexander's future development. It was fast and excellent.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Why should I cooperate with Steven? I have already put away my masochistic tendencies."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven took a deep breath and suppressed the anger in his heart. Whenever Diana mentioned other men, it would arouse his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll talk to you about this matter when I come back tonight. The cooperation conditions I offer will not be worse than Alexander's. Diana, as a doctor, you must want to cooperate with the most capable people and promote this technology to those who need it more.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or I'll pick you up after work in the evening."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana could only say, "No. Let's talk about it when you come back."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Diana hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was upset. She stood up and went upstairs to change her clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen sent Diana another message, saying that she had been doing well recently.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The steward was also under Helen's control. Helen told Diana that she didn't have to worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought about it and felt that Helen would retaliate and make life difficult for the steward.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The steward was Queenie's person. Now, only the two elders were blocking Queenie's way.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been almost a month since Queenie acquired Paula's company.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A month later, a large number of problems would emerge. Queenie would cover the losses and would definitely make no profit.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of doing business, Paula was twenty years ahead of Queenie. It allowed Paula to discover the problems in advance. Queenie would not be Paula's opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Women understood women's minds best.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought, "In my previous life, Paula was utterly unprepared for Queenie. It led to her miserable defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life, with my reminder and Cecil being my side, Queenie's development speed has been declining.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My first step has been successful."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana went to find Nolan happily. Luna came to pick her up.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna couldn't help but ask, "Diana, are you obsessed in love again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words stunned Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at Luna in surprise. She laughed in anger. "Luna, am I that kind of person?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna started the car and then said, "Well, who kept pleasing Steven before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana suddenly wanted to hit Luna!</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="680.html">« Prev</a><a href="682.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
