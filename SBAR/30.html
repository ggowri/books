In her previous life, Cecil had been Queenie&#x27;s simp and had often helped Queenie bully her.</p><p>Therefore, cutting off his hands tonight was to avenge herself.</p><p>Diana sneered, &quot;Just a moment ago, when Cecil wanted to cut off my hands and make me apologize, did any of you stand up for me? You all just watched as I was bullied and seemed pretty pleased about it.</p><p>&quot;Queenie was the one in the wrong. So why are you here now, Paula? Do you realize how bold that is?&quot;</p><p>Paula was taken aback. Just moments ago, she had also thought Diana deserved what was happening to her. She tried to explain, &quot;Diana, I didn&#x27;t know the truth earlier. I thought you really pushed Madam Farley...&quot;</p><p>Diana cut her off, &quot;Even if you knew the truth, would it have mattered? Would you have saved me or believed me? No. You always chose to believe Queenie. I&#x27;ve never framed her, but you never bothered to investigate. You just listened to her and let your family insult and humiliate me. Now, I have no ties with you anymore. I&#x27;ve signed the severance letter and the divorce papers. Have I contacted you in the three months since the divorce?&quot;</p><p>Paula was left speechless, but she still couldn&#x27;t stand the thought of Queenie being in trouble. She quickly pleaded, &quot;Diana, if you save Queenie, can we call it even this time?&quot;</p><p>Hearing this, Diana almost cried out of anger.</p><p>Her heart ached, and she found it difficult to breathe.</p><p>With tears in her eyes, Diana smiled at Paula and addressed her by name. &quot;Paula, there will be no &#x27;even&#x27; between us. It can only be me winning because you have never been fair to me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Diana,&quot; Paula roared angrily, &quot;We are still family...&quot;</p><p>Diana interrupted coldly, &quot;Then why did you sign the letter of severance of parentage?&quot;</p><p>Paula was left speechless. Yes, she and Diana had indeed signed the letter of severance.</p><p>As Paula looked at Diana, who exuded natural nobility just like her, Paula couldn&#x27;t help but feel disappointed.</p><p>&quot;Diana, you truly disappoint me,&quot; Paula uttered.</p><p>&quot;You never had any expectations of her, so where does this disappointment come from?&quot; A cold and aged voice suddenly interjected from nearby.</p><p>Paula turned around abruptly and saw Olivia supporting Leopold as he approached.</p><p>&quot;Grandpa, why didn&#x27;t I see you in there just now? Were you scared?&quot; Diana&#x27;s tone towards Leopold was sweet and gentle, completely different from her previous attitude.</p><p>Leopold thought, &quot;Damn girl, can&#x27;t you leave me with some dignity in front of outsiders? How could I be scared?&quot;</p><p>Leopold walked up to Paula and stared at her with sharp eyes. &quot;Screw you. When you needed her, you pretended to be kind to her. But when you didn&#x27;t need her, you mistreated her. You bullied my granddaughter and now claim to be disappointed in her? Who are you to feel disappointed? You and your family all are vicious.&quot;</p><p>Paula stared at Leopold in shock, thinking, &quot;So this is the person who taught my daughter. No wonder she ended up doing such terrible things.&quot;</p><p>Steven also looked at Leopold, surprised to learn that he was Diana&#x27;s grandfather. Diana had never mentioned having a grandfather before.</p><p>&quot;Sweet pea, come on. You look gorgeous today. I&#x27;ll take you to a blind date. I met a man in the park a few days ago. His grandson is 28 years old and would be a perfect match for you. He recently returned from studying abroad and now has his own company. It&#x27;s time for him to settle down.&quot;</p><p>Diana was stunned.</p><p>Leopold changed the topic so quickly, and it seemed like this had never happened in her previous life.</p><p>Diana said, &quot;Grandpa, I have just escaped from a marriage and finally become single. Why do you want to lead me back into the misery again? I won&#x27;t go.&quot;</p><p>Leopold said. &quot;Silly girl. You are single now, so it would be easier for you to accept someone new. I&#x27;ve seen his photo. He is very good-looking and rich. You&#x27;d surely like his looks. And if he doesn&#x27;t meet your standards, I can find a few more men for you.&quot;</p><p>Diana and Olivia were left speechless.</p><p>Steven approached, gritting his teeth as he faced Leopold. &quot;Diana is still my nominal wife, so she cannot go on a blind date.&quot;</p><p>Leopold appeared startled and anxious. &quot;Diana, didn&#x27;t you tell me that you were divorced?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="29.html">« Prev</a><a href="31.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
