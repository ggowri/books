He was frightened and died of a heart attack. This..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was scary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Oh my god, how can they be so terrible? They only bully the weak, lonely elderly people and girls. How can Queenie and Gale have such friends?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Gellar, do you still want to save people like this? If you save them, it will only cause more people to get hurt."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan couldn't help but ask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There was finally a hint of fluctuation in Steven's calm eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Evan, you said I'm going to save them?" he spoke each word with gritted teeth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven suddenly remembered that Diana told him on the phone that Harry said he would get them out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Harry thought they were in the same group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He held his forehead with his hand. Harry dared to say anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As expected, Queenie was spoiled by him and became fearless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan nodded and said, "Mr. Gellar, as long as Ms. Marsh asks you, you will always respond to her requests.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Before Ms. Bishop left, she was seriously ill once, but Queenie called and you stayed with Queenie all night while Ms. Bishop went to the hospital alone for an IV.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"This has happened countless times since Ms. Marsh came back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Gellar, I want to tell you something. No one will wait for someone forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"If you are just perfunctory in a relationship, it will end sooner or later. Diana will leave you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Shut up, you don't have to remind me of these things. I didn't do it well..." Steven wanted to say something but stopped himself. It was more than just that he didn't do it well...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula's words were still clear in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He frowned, turned around, and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After walking a few steps, he suddenly stopped. If there was someone behind Queenie, he must force that person out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Stop Queenie's card. Tell her that she saved my life back then and has spent my money for more than one billion dollars in the past few years. It's enough to pay her back. Go to the Marsh family in person."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven narrowed his eyes. Queenie spent so much of his money, but he didn't see her buy anything expensive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But as his wife, Diana never had his card.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven thought for a moment and said, "Evan, go check where Queenie has spent all my money over the years and see if there are any large remittances. More than a billion dollars is enough to set up a large company."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan was very excited and said, "You finally suspect this matter, I will check it now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven looked at the smile on Evan's face and suddenly realized why she said he was a fool.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the Marsh Villa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Queenie saw the news about Harry and others, she was so angry that she smashed many things in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">We had them hiding well before, so what happened this time?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Could it be that Diana also knew that Harry and others had a relationship with her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula did not go to the company today. When she heard the sound of things being smashed upstairs, a hint of satisfaction flashed across her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She thought, "Smash it. Within half a year, your comfortable life will be gone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale also came back angrily, and when he saw Paula at home, he felt like he had seen a savior.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mom, help me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula frowned and asked, "What's wrong? What's making you so anxious?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale was very angry. He sat on the sofa with a gloomy look, looking like he had a deep hatred. "Mom, today I found a few people to teach Diana a lesson, but they were a little greedy and wanted to take turns raping Diana. In the end, I don't know what happened, the police suddenly showed up and arrested them all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"They are my friends. I went to Diana and agreed to let her go home, and I only asked her to issue a letter of understanding and release my friends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But she even exposed so many things now. Mom, please help me persuade her..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Before he could finish his words, Paula slapped him hard.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="124.html">« Prev</a><a href="126.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
