How did the cops get here so </span><span>fast?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie exhaled a long breath, relief flooding through her at the sight of the uniforms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man gripping her legs sneered, "So the cops are here. Big deal. I'll take her down before they can do a damn thing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, he pulled out a gun and pressed it against Queenie's temple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's heart skipped a beat. She'd considered this possibility, but facing it was something else. Her legs felt like lead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All she could do was hope the police had the skill to save her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streamed down her face as she turned to the officers, her voice trembling. "Please... help me! I don't even know these people. Why are they doing this to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew playing dumb and helpless was her best chance of getting out of this alive. She didn't resist, didn't fight&mdash;just stood there trembling, radiating fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was tense, a delicate balance of power as guns pointed in every direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gambled on the fact that the man wouldn't have the guts to pull the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam, standing in the doorway, looked utterly blindsided. How the hell had the police shown up so quickly?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His stomach dropped as realization set in. He'd been played. Queenie had planned this all along. She was far more dangerous than he'd imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, you conniving snake! You called the cops, didn't you?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie didn't answer, her tears flowing freely as she sobbed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boo-hoo-hoo..." Her cries were soft but persistent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the men by the entrance were already subdued, pinned down by officers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the three men in the room remained standing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the officers barked, "Release the hostage! Cooperate, and we might go easy on you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Easy on me?!" the man with the gun barked out a bitter laugh. "You think I care? You think prison's new to me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let my boys go, or I'll put a bullet in her head right here, right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shoved the gun against Queenie's temple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp streak of red appeared on her forehead where the barrel pressed into her skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..." She sucked in a sharp breath, the pain shooting through her like ice water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her wide, teary eyes locked onto the officers, silently begging for salvation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help me... please," she whimpered, her voice cracking with raw fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her disheveled hair, bruised face, and trembling frame painted her as the perfect victim, pulling at everyone's heartstrings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was a master of playing the part, and now, she leaned into it with everything she had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the officers at the door were visibly shaken. How could a group of men gang up on someone so defenseless? It was sickening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young officer in the lead clenched his jaw, his determination solidifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't about to let this slide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He narrowed his eyes, his steady hand adjusting his aim. Without a word, he pulled the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!" The thug's gun clattered to the ground, blood spurting from his wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Argh!" the man screamed, clutching his arm as pain and terror twisted his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two men holding Queenie flinched, the sound of the shot jolting them like electricity. They instinctively dropped her and hit the floor, hands over their heads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie, though outwardly trembling, remained calm inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seizing the moment, she darted to the side, pressing herself against the wall, safely out of the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That single shot had turned the tide completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eight officers stormed in, quickly subduing the remaining three men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get your hands off me, you pigs! Do you even know who I am?!" the wounded man shouted, still defiant despite his situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For someone who'd spent his life in crime, prison was a revolving door, nothing new.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But today felt different&mdash;this time, he might not walk away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Jace to shield him, he was as good as done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Smack!" The officer closest to him drove a punch square into his jaw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut it! You think being a thug makes you special? You're nothing," the officer growled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, the men were cuffed and dragged out of the apartment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer who had fired the shot, clearly the leader, stayed behind to assess the scene. His gaze softened as he approached Queenie. "Ma'am, are you alright? Do you need medical attention?" He asked, his voice calm and reassuring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie hugged herself tightly, shivering. "N-no... I'll be fine. Thank you for saving me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave her a small, comforting smile. "Glad you're safe. If anything else happens, don't hesitate to call. Here, this is my number."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He handed her a card, his tone firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, those guys won't see daylight anytime soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you... thank you so much!" Queenie cried, bowing slightly as tears streamed down her face. "If you hadn't come when you did..." Her voice trailed off, trembling with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer nodded and even arranged for someone to fix the door before leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they were gone, Queenie let out a long, shaky breath, her body finally relaxing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Phew..." she muttered, running a hand through her hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything had gone exactly as planned. Jace Foliot's youngest son was out of the picture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie turned to her phone on the windowsill and picked it up. "Jace, did you hear that? That's the sound of your empire crumbling. I came back just to see your last move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, and by the way, all those little 'secrets' on your phone? I've already sent them to the cops."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other end, Jace sat frozen, tears streaming down his face. He'd always thought he was untouchable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Queenie had outplayed him at every turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, you'll pay for this. Mark my words," he spat, his voice shaking with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smiled, though her bruised face made it look more menacing than </span><span>triumphant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, Jace. The only one paying is you. You've hurt so many women&mdash;I'm just giving you what you deserve. And as for those six subsidiaries? They're mine now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, and let me spell it out for you&mdash;I got close to you for this very moment. I was never after your main company. What I wanted were your subsidiaries scattered across the region.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your main company? Let your precious nephews fight over it. But don't worry&mdash;the one they hand to Mark? That'll end up in my hands, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You snake..." Jace hissed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie laughed softly and ended the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Foliot dynasty had fallen, and she couldn't help but bask in her victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Diana had just received the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had wiped out Jace's underworld network, and even his powerful connections were crumbling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sat in her wheelchair, her expression calm as she processed the information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna, standing nearby, tilted her head in confusion. "Diana, aren't you even a little surprised? It's like you saw this coming."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glanced at the documents in her hand, putting on a faint smile. "Queenie is a force of nature. If she can wrap George around her finger, taking down Jace is nothing. Mark my words, she's just getting started. She's backed by a team of elites, and one day, they'll make her the queen of the business world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her previous life, Diana had let love blind her. This time, she wouldn't give Queenie the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna blinked, shocked by Diana's words. Queenie's capabilities were terrifying&mdash;she'd even brought Jace Foliot to his knees. "Diana, are you really going to let her rise unchecked? If she grows any stronger, won't it be impossible to stop her later?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="929.html">« Prev</a><a href="931.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
