She ordered ten gigolos!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie's eyes sparkled with mischief. "This is just the ammunition I needed." She typed: [Penelope, leave this to me. I'm going to ruin her reputation.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"This video is a goldmine!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Penelope replied: [I've sent it your way. Do what you need to do.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">[Thanks!] Queenie smirked, already plotting her next move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tomorrow morning, she'd pay Steven a visit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As dawn broke, Diana slowly opened her eyes, welcoming the beautiful day ahead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The morning was peaceful, the kind of tranquility that wrapped around her like a warm blanket.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But just as Diana was soaking in the serenity, her phone on the nightstand shattered the silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With a sigh, Diana sat up and answered the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Hello?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, you wanted to discuss divorce, right? Come back home now." Steven's voice was flat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana's heart raced as she jumped out of bed. "Steven, are you serious? You really want to go through with the divorce? This isn't a joke?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There was a long pause on the other end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yeah," he finally said, and the line went dead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yay!" Diana cheered, dashing to the bathroom to get ready.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, in Steven's home, he sat in silence after hanging up, his expression unreadable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the kitchen, a chef was busy preparing breakfast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Half an hour later, the table was filled with all of Diana's favorite dishes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven had no clue what Diana's favorite foods were. So, he had the chef prepare the dishes she usually made.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was only then that it hit him&mdash;every dish Diana cooked was something he loved to eat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Gellar, breakfast is ready," the chef announced as he stepped out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven waved him off, estimating that Diana would arrive soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His gaze flickered toward the door, a hint of anticipation in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A few minutes later, the sound of the keypad echoed through the air, signaling her arrival.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A faint smile appeared on Steven's face, but it vanished the moment he saw Queenie walk through the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Queenie? What are you doing here? How did you get the code to my place?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie smiled sweetly, her tone deceptively gentle, "Steven, don't you remember? This was supposed to be our wedding home. You married Diana instead, but the code has never changed&mdash;it's still my birthday."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven blinked in surprise, momentarily taken aback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He quickly regained his composure, his voice turning cold. "I have things to attend to. You should leave."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Queenie didn't budge; instead, she feigned hurt and stepped further inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This morning, she had dressed in a way she knew Steven would find appealing. With tears welling in her eyes, Queenie asked, "Steven, if Diana hadn't come back, you would have married me, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A sarcastic smile crossed Steven's face. "Queenie, it would never be you. You've been trying to push Diana out for years, and even if she weren't in the picture, I wouldn't choose you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He knew her well enough to see that her heart wasn't truly in it for him. Steven had indulged her for too long, but he wasn't naive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie had left him when he was at his lowest, only to return when he was on the rise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie felt the sting of his words like a sharp blade slicing through her confidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After years of clawing her way into Steven's life, Diana had shattered her standing in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In disbelief, Queenie stepped closer, her voice dripping with nostalgia. "Steven, have you forgotten? We grew up together. I was there for you during your toughest times. You said I was the one you wanted to marry. Why can't you admit it now? Are you in love with Diana?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As if to punctuate her point, she deliberately settled herself in Steven's lap, wrapping her arms tightly around his neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just then, Diana walked in, catching the scene before her eyes.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="166.html">« Prev</a><a href="168.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
