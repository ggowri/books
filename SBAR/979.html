She needed a quiet space to share the secret with Diana. She feared that she might never have another chance.</p><p>&quot;Diana, let&#x27;s find somewhere quiet to talk. I&#x27;ll tell you why I disliked you in the past. I&#x27;ll tell you the truth,&quot; Paula said.</p><p>Diana wasn&#x27;t sure whether to believe her. She thought that if Paula truly had some hidden reason, she should have said it earlier instead of waiting until now.</p><p>But when she saw the earnest look in Paula&#x27;s eyes, she eventually nodded and asked Luna to take them to the lounge.</p><p>&quot;Luna, take us to the lounge.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sure, Diana,&quot; Luna replied.</p><p>Paula handed over a gift bag. &quot;Diana, this is your Christmas gift.&quot;</p><p>Diana froze for a moment, startled. Paula had never given her a Christmas gift. Every year, Paula would prepare gowns worth millions of dollars for Queenie, spoiling her like a princess.</p><p>If this had been in the past, Diana might have been overjoyed. But now, she felt nothing.</p><p>In the past, Paula always went out of her way to be warm and affectionate with Queenie in front of her.</p><p>She&#x27;d organize everything for Queenie.</p><p>The table at their home was always filled with delicate pastries and fruits that Queenie loved.</p><p>She&#x27;d gently ask Queenie about her sleep, worrying whether she had nightmares.</p><p>And whenever she said these things, she would glance at Diana on purpose. At those moments, Diana felt her heart was torn apart. She had grown up without a mother, so she yearned for Paula&#x27;s love more than anything else. She would comfort herself, thinking that as long as she was good enough, her mother would surely love her.</p><p>Now, she realized her persistence was just a joke.</p><p>After all, someone who didn&#x27;t want to love her, no matter what she did, would never love her.</p><p>Now, this love meant nothing to her.</p><p>She looked at Paula coldly. &quot;You don&#x27;t have to prepare gowns for me anymore. There&#x27;s no need for that between us.&quot;</p><p>Paula had anticipated rejection but still felt a pang of hurt when it came. She knew this was her own fault.</p><p>&quot;Diana, I...&quot;</p><p>&quot;If you have something to say, just say it. The past is over. We&#x27;ve both accepted it, so let&#x27;s leave it behind.&quot;</p><p>Diana interrupted, her voice calm yet firm. She had no desire to revisit old wounds.</p><p>Paula looked at Diana&#x27;s composed face, hesitated, but ultimately said nothing more.</p><p>Just as the three were heading to the lounge, a furious voice rang out behind them. &quot;Diana, stop right there!&quot;</p><p>Diana gestured for Luna to stop pushing her wheelchair.</p><p>Luna looked at Queenie with a flash of hostility in her eyes.</p><p>However, when she saw that Queenie was also in a wheelchair, she couldn&#x27;t help but laugh.</p><p>Mario wheeled Queenie into the room. Diana glanced at her rival, a smirk playing on her lips. &quot;Queenie, I heard you got beaten up on Christmas Eve. Seems the rumor was true. What happened to your leg? Crippled now?&quot;</p><p>Queenie had marched in, ready to confront Diana, but before she could say a word, Diana brought up that humiliating night. Her Christmas had been utterly ruined.</p><p>She opened her mouth to lash out but froze when she noticed Paula standing there with a gift bag.</p><p>The brand on the bag was a top luxury label. Every year, Paula had bought Queenie gowns from that brand, while Diana received something cheap and unimpressive. Yet this time, Paula had chosen Diana instead.</p><p>Jealousy burned in Queenie&#x27;s eyes. &quot;Paula, you used to buy me these kinds of dresses. The ones you give Diana are just cheap online finds. Now you&#x27;re splurging on her? Do you think she appreciates it?&quot;</p><p>She looked at Paula pleadingly. &quot;Mom, as long as you&#x27;re good to me, you&#x27;ll always be my mom.&quot;</p><p>After everything she had been through, Queenie finally understood that Paula was the ideal mother for her.</p><p>Paula&#x27;s gaze turned icy. &quot;Queenie, are you delusional?</p><p>&quot;Spending over twenty years spoiling a vile woman like you was the biggest mistake of my life.&quot;</p><p>Paula looked at her coldly. &quot;You really have no shame. Whether it&#x27;s family or love, you&#x27;re always pushing further, taking more than you deserve.&quot;</p><p>She thought back to how good she had been to Queenie, and a wave of regret washed over her.</p><p>She had hurt her beautiful and talented biological daughter to pamper Queenie, and she would never forgive herself for that.</p><p>&quot;Ha!&quot; Queenie laughed mockingly instead of getting angry. &quot;Paula, you only give Diana what I don&#x27;t want. Don&#x27;t you remember what you told me? You said you&#x27;d rather love a dog than give Diana even a shred of affection. And now you want to play the perfect mother?&quot;</p><p>Her goal had always been to drive a permanent wedge between Paula and Diana.</p><p>Diana snorted, unimpressed by Queenie&#x27;s provocation. She knew Queenie was deliberately twisting the knife in Paula&#x27;s heart. The more Paula had favored Queenie in the past, the more pain she felt now.</p><p>&quot;Queenie, why are you here?&quot; Diana asked flatly. She didn&#x27;t want to relive old conversations.</p><p>Queenie&#x27;s expression twisted as she remembered why she had come. &quot;Diana, were you behind what happened on Christmas Eve?&quot;</p><p>Diana raised an eyebrow. &quot;Does it matter who was behind it?&quot;</p><p>In truth, Diana didn&#x27;t know who was responsible.</p><p>She felt it could very well have been Steven.</p><p>&quot;Queenie, you&#x27;ve offended so many people in secret. Remember the Foliot family? No matter how ruthless you are, you&#x27;re no match for them.&quot;</p><p>Queenie scoffed, unconcerned. &quot;The Foliots? They&#x27;re nothing. What can they do to me? Diana, if you&#x27;ve got the guts, come at me directly. Let&#x27;s fight face-to-face.&quot;</p><p>Diana blinked in surprise and chuckled. &quot;Queenie, you finally said something with a bit of dignity. If you really came at me openly, I might not win. But I can also take a page out of your book. All I care about is the result. The process? Not so much.&quot;</p><p>Queenie clenched her fists, her fury barely contained. She took a deep breath to steady herself. &quot;Diana, I hate you more than anything. I&#x27;ll make you suffer. Steven and I are getting engaged soon. Isn&#x27;t he the man you love most? Well, he&#x27;s mine now.&quot;</p><p>She stared at Diana, hoping to see her break down in pain. But to her surprise, Diana simply smiled, calm and unaffected.</p><p>Diana knew exactly what Queenie wanted to see.</p><p>But now that she knew the truth, it didn&#x27;t matter who Queenie married.</p><p>She smiled and said, &quot;Queenie, he&#x27;s the man you&#x27;ve coveted your entire life. Only you would think he&#x27;s a treasure. I wish you two stay together forever.&quot;</p><p>Queenie froze, stunned. Steven had been her trump card, her surest weapon to hurt Diana. She knew how deeply Diana had once loved him.</p><p>But Diana remained composed, her face free of sorrow.</p><p>Queenie couldn&#x27;t accept it. If even this couldn&#x27;t hurt Diana, she had no idea how else to make her suffer.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="978.html">« Prev</a><a href="980.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
