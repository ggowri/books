If this gets out, it&#x27;ll be so embarrassing for me! My movie is about to hit the theaters, and I just signed with Excellence Entertainment. You and Dad can&#x27;t mess this up for me. You can&#x27;t divorce now, at least not yet!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Just wait a bit. If you rush to be Mark&#x27;s wife, people are going to blame you for his wife&#x27;s death. Lily&#x27;s parents are still around, and they come from a respectable family. If they get even a whiff of something between you two, it&#x27;ll be a nightmare for both of you.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mom, have you lost your mind? You&#x27;re not thinking straight!&quot; Queenie was already on edge, her anger flashing in her eyes.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Amelie felt the weight of those words. The thought of a divorce made her uneasy.</p><p style="text-align:left;">If she went through with it, she would be left with nothing.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After all, Mark might not even value her once he had her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She had nothing to her name, and even if Lily had some skills and a strong family, she still ended up dead.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Amelie wasn&#x27;t naive. She wanted to marry Mark, but she also knew how reckless and arrogant he was. He wouldn&#x27;t appreciate her after he got her. He had plenty of other women in his life, many of whom were younger and prettier.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Queenie, I see what you&#x27;re getting at. I won&#x27;t be divorcing your father. As for Mark, I know exactly who he is. Once I&#x27;m him, the novelty will wear off. The more elusive I am, the more he&#x27;ll crave me. If I keep him on his toes, it&#x27;ll work to my advantage. I slept with him today and secured us a business deal. Tomorrow afternoon, I&#x27;ll take you to meet our partners.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">At the mention of profit, Queenie&#x27;s face lit up.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mom, you really are the best!&quot; she said, her eyes sparkling with mischief</p><p style="text-align:left;">As long as her mother stood by her, she would always be good to her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Thanks, Mom! If everything goes well tomorrow, I&#x27;ll get you a designer bag you love,&quot; she promised.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Amelie yearned for a life of luxury. Designer clothes and high-end handbags were her greatest dreams.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She laughed and patted Queenie&#x27;s hand, feeling a sense of relief. &quot;It&#x27;s settled then. I&#x27;ll text you at four tomorrow. You meet the partners at the agreed spot. For now, I&#x27;ll head home and charm your dad. I need to smooth things over first.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Sounds good! Mom, Dad has put up with so much for you. When you get home, pick up some of his favorite food, and maybe grab a couple of nice outfits. He&#x27;ll forgive you, especially since he has his flings.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">That last comment resonated with Amelie, giving her a newfound confidence.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In her eyes, Jeff was simply a man who cared too much about money.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Don&#x27;t worry. Men who are all about money are the easiest to handle. It&#x27;s the emotional ones that are tricky; once they fall in love, they become impossible to sway,&quot; she remarked, walking out.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As Queenie sank into the sofa, she felt a wave of nostalgia wash over her. Suddenly, she found herself thinking of Paula, missing her unexpectedly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">When she was ill, Paula would skip work to take care of her, cooking and buying her the best clothes and shoes every season.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But now, her mother seemed completely absorbed in men, hardly paying attention to her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie sighed, a bitter smile tugging at her lips. Was this what she deserved for abandoning Paula?</p><div class="pagination"><a href="801.html">« Prev</a><a href="803.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
