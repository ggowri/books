Turning his head, he saw Steven gazing out the window. Following his line of sight, Evan spotted Diana and Cecil.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pair stood face to face in the snow, both smiling as they looked at each other. They were a handsome couple, their beauty breathtaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching their happy expressions, Evan couldn't help but gush. "Mr. Gellar, they're so in love... I mean, it's so romantic! Cupcakes in winter are like a couple's tradition. Look how happy Ms. Bishop is!</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're the same age, and they seem to have a lot in common. They're a perfect match, a real power couple. If they were to get together, their kids would be incredibly smart and beautiful."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was just speaking from the heart, genuinely moved by the romantic scene of the attractive couple in the snowy landscape.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, they're just too cute together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan continued enthusiastically, "Young couples these days are so romantic. After catching a movie, guys always buy their girlfriends a cupcake outside the theater.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's something about sharing that warm, sweet treat that brings couples closer together."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven shot him an icy glare. "A child between Diana and Cecil?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mere thought of her having a child with another man made his blood boil.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impossible. Diana can only have my children."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you implying I'm old?" he asked with a menacing tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan's smile froze mid-laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell did I just say?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was I thinking?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mouth always runs away from me when I get emotional.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God, I want to disappear right now. What was I thinking, saying that? Diana is still Steven's wife! I basically just suggested she was cheating on him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha..." He let out an awkward laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, no, I absolutely wasn't calling you old. Though you are pushing thirty."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, Steven was a bit older, while Diana and Cecil were the same age and had more in common.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's why Steven couldn't understand their brand of romance.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most men develop in stages.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Steven was different. He'd jumped straight from boyhood to maturity, never experiencing the carefree teenage years most guys had.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even before he was legally an adult, he carried himself like an old soul. Smiles were rare in his daily life.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ironically, he'd smile when he was angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But those weren't happy smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he smiled while angry, that evil grin meant someone was about to have a terrible day.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven watched as Diana and Cecil got into the car. His knuckles turned white from gripping his phone. Having never been in love before, he was clueless about creating romantic moments.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What exactly counts as romantic?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan did a double-take, turning to stare at him in disbelief. "Mr. Gellar, that's hilarious coming from you! You're always doing romantic things for Queenie. Why are you asking me what romance is?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Like how you'd do absolutely anything for Queenie - even ditching your wife to throw her that extravagant birthday party. That's romance right there."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven froze. "Was that what romance in relationships was all about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had done all those things for Queenie but never once for Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, Diana and Cecil were out there doing a typical couple of things.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven took a deep breath, his voice turning ice-cold. "Back to the office. You're working overtime tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan smacked himself in the mouth. Way to go, big mouth! Working late on such a freezing night, he was trying to kill him...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="714.html">« Prev</a><a href="716.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
