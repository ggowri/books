I caught the seafood myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph recalled that Diana had mentioned her fondness for free diving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He sat down, admiring the beautiful thermos, and grinned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana handed him a spoon and asked with a smile, "Can you cook? I brought some ingredients and put them in the refrigerator."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph, blushing at her smile, nodded and replied, "Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's great." Diana put the ingredients in the sealed bags and froze them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at her back, Joseph smiled faintly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After putting things away, Diana returned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She also brought some clothes for Joseph. "Joseph, winter is coming, and it will get colder. Our company's down jackets and coats are good. I've brought a few sets for you and some for your grandma as well," she said, pointing to the bag at the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay. Thank you!" Joseph responded happily, feeling truly cared for.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Go ahead and eat," Diana said, lowering her head as she saw her phone vibrating. "I'm going to take a call outside."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure," Joseph replied, blushing and feeling too shy to look up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unaware of Joseph's shyness, Diana went outside to answer the call, which turned out to be from Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hello, are we going to get a divorce?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven, standing in front of the office's floor-to-ceiling window, looked down at the scenery with a sneer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, have you forgotten what I said? You can only get a divorce if I die," he responded, his voice even yet resolute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if she no longer loved him, he would make her love him again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her leaving was something he was still not used to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She left decisively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't take anything away from the villa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was only last night that Steven realized she had completely moved on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana frowned, her eyes inexplicably red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She took a deep breath, her voice choking with sobs. "Steven, I... have died once. You killed me. You personally killed me. When I was dying, I longed for you to save me, but you killed me! Steven, why won't you divorce? If I could do it all over again, I would never give you the chance to kill me. It's you and those Marsh family members who should die."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's words dripped with hatred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hung up the phone and leaned against the wall, still haunted by the nightmare from last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her body shook with discomfort as she sank to the floor, wrapping her arms tightly around herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The weight of her hatred and pain threatened to overwhelm her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Steven's phone slipped from his grasp as every accusation from Diana struck a nerve, making him wonder if her words held some truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seemed she truly hated him. If he had endured the same torment, he might have killed those who had bullied him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Closing his eyes, he realized that his indulgence for Queenie had caused such misery for Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, he finally admitted it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was right for Diana to hate him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the hospital, Diana fought to suppress the hatred burning within her before returning to the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she lifted her eyes, she caught sight of a woman entering the ward, leaving her slightly taken aback.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="366.html">« Prev</a><a href="368.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
