"Jeff, if I don't pay off these debts, your four useless sons won't be able to cover it either. They'll come knocking on Queenie's door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, she's got plenty of assets in her name, but we all know how much you care about her. Do you really want her wealth to be dragged into this mess to pay off my debts?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm doing this to protect Queenie. Your love for her is fake? You don't want to shield her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was left speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie scoffed silently, thinking, "Paula claims she's protecting me now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's just a cover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I can't only swallow the bitter pill. I'm the daughter of the mistress; this can't get out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Jeff's anger simmered beneath the surface. He mused, "Paula does have a point. My sons are hardly capable of handling this. If the creditors come after Queenie, and if they dig up the dirt on our family, it'll be the end for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff exploded. "Paula, you're nothing but a disaster. I'm getting older, and now I have to deal with your mess..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula replied, "Jeff, we're divorced now. My company is in ruins, and you turned your back on me the moment things got tough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All these years, I supported you ungrateful guys, and you didn't even have the decency to say thank you. The minute I hit rock bottom, you bailed on me, and now you want to blame me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe this is karma biting you back. You've committed some serious sins, and now you're facing the consequences at a time when you should be enjoying life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've also heard whispers about your company being involved in tax evasion. You'd better keep that under wraps, or if your employees decide to spill the beans, those back taxes will wipe you clean."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was stunned, his face draining of color. "You... Paula, how do you know about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! Jeff, if you don't want anyone to know, then maybe you shouldn't do anything shady in the first place. I've seen everything you've done over the years. I warned you about the law, but you chose to ignore it. This is all on you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just think about it. Queenie has a lot of assets now; you better stay on her good side. She is not your biological daughter, and trust me, she won't be as easy to manipulate as I am. If you think sweet-talking her will get you a big payday, good luck with that. I hope your precious Queenie loves you enough to bail you out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Paula hung up, a satisfied grin spreading across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today was a good day, and she felt empowered as she turned to her two friends in the private dining room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I owe you both so much. I couldn't have done this without your support."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula was deeply grateful for their unwavering support and for the trust shown by those who lent her money. The loans were real, and so were the debts. She knew that only by playing the entire act convincingly could she prevent Queenie from suspecting anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Linda chuckled, reminding her, "Paula, we may have pulled it off, but let's not get complacent. It took us ten long months to set this up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elina chimed in, "Now we need to lay low for a while and expose their secrets one by one. We need to bring the mistress to light and make sure everyone knows how heartless Jeff really is. Only then can we get you the justice you deserve."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula raised an eyebrow, her smile confident and poised. "I want Jeff to admit to his infidelity himself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Linda added, "Paula, we've all been through the wringer lately. Let's sit down and enjoy a proper meal to celebrate. It's been ages since we've had a moment like this to unwind."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="573.html">« Prev</a><a href="575.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
