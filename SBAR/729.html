So this was the show Queenie wanted her to see.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had pushed all the blame onto Jeff. Queenie was about to cut him loose now that she was done using him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff had finally outlived his usefulness.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment later, a man appeared on screen. Diana quickly zoomed in, and her eyes widened slightly in surprise. If she wasn't mistaken, this man was a notorious talent agent in the entertainment industry, and he was publicly inviting Queenie to join his company.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remembered from her previous life that this agent had numerous scandals surface later. Many actresses had been coerced into sleeping their way to the top.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some even...</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because Queenie chose the entertainment industry in this life that she crossed paths with Zion, that devil.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana could barely contain her excitement, even heaven was on her side!</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, this was getting interesting. Queenie was walking straight into her own grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she heard the man's self-introduction. "Hello everyone, I'm Zion Swift, the top agent at Excellence Entertainment. Queenie has always been an artist I've had my eye on. I'd like to formally invite her to join our company and achieve greatness together, with all of you as witnesses."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zion's invitation instantly elevated Queenie's status in the industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The livestream comments section was flooded with congratulations.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana just smiled, thoroughly amused. In this industry, you need both connections and opportunities.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie always prioritized her interests. She definitely wouldn't turn down a contract with Excellence Entertainment. It was her fast track to the top of the entertainment industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for what would happen next... well, that would be up to Zion to orchestrate.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha..." Diana laughed with delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Climb as high as you want, Queenie. The higher you climb, the harder you'll fall."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana took a deep breath, in no rush to strike back.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then another thought struck her. There was only one reason Zion would step up and invite Queenie in front of all the media: he was doing it for Steven's sake.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had always portrayed herself as Steven's fianc&eacute;e in public. It was her only value.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt frustrated. If Steven were willing to back her, these two influential players would be impossible to take down.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Zion was a devil.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's current worth came from having Steven behind her, and they could potentially make her the queen of entertainment.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana put down her phone, stood up, and walked to the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her loose nightgown revealed glimpses of her long, slender legs, and her slim waist, though delicate, held an understated strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her arms crossed over her chest, and she gazed out at the view until she saw Luna arriving. Then, she headed to the bathroom to freshen up.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside Steven's office...</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tall figure sat in the swivel chair, watching Queenie's press conference with an icy smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan stood beside him, noting that Steven's smile wasn't one of amusement. It was pure rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, Queenie's got some nerve, throwing Ms. Bishop under the bus like that. All those schemes were her own doing. She's absolutely shameless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan fumed, then added in confusion, "Mr. Gellar, and what's Zion doing jumping into this mess?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's fingers traced his chin thoughtfully. His perfectly manicured nails were clean and neat, the rounded tips showing a healthy pink hue - elegant yet masculine.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zion's backing Queenie this morning because he knows I'm the one behind her," he said in an emotionless voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan froze, eyeing him warily. "Mr. Gellar, then you..."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="728.html">« Prev</a><a href="730.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
