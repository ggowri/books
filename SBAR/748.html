Now Diana and I are about to enjoy lunch. We have work to discuss."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear he was politely trying to get Steven to leave. Steven's expression tightened at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked down at Diana, his smile cold as he asked, "Diana, are you really having lunch alone with him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice held an icy edge. Steven hadn't forgotten that Alexander was once introduced to Diana as a match, and both of their families had encouraged them to get together.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that Diana suddenly had a new brother and grandfather had always unsettled him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Steven's irritation, Diana just smiled back. "Mr. Gellar, who I choose to have lunch with is my business. I'm simply here sharing a meal with Alexander. There's no need to overreact."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though they were living under the same roof, they had agreed not to interfere in each other's private lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eyes darkened, a barely controlled anger simmering there. He knew this entire situation was his own doing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words felt familiar. He'd said the same thing to her countless times before, and now she was simply throwing it back at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't pushed Diana away, Alexander wouldn't have had a chance to step in.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lowered his voice and told her, "After you're done with lunch, come home early. I'll be back early too."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spoke loud enough for Alexander to hear.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander raised an eyebrow, giving Steven a cool look.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven smirked, his gaze practically daring Alexander as if to say Diana belonged to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander clenched his fists, a confident smile playing on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their silent contest of wills looked more childish than anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Steven turned and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt bewildered. In the past, Steven would have simply ignored her. She wondered, "What's gotten into him? Has he lost his mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, just ignore him. He's been acting strange lately. He used to ignore me entirely; maybe he's under some stress."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander knew well enough what was bothering Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was all due to the recent clashes with Queenie involving Steven and Levi.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just outside the room, Steven paused as he heard Diana's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was right. He had ignored her every time he saw her back then.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those days, he'd blindly trusted Queenie, resenting Diana, so he shut her out.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now he realized Diana had taken all his past indifference to heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mood darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvette noticed the shift in him and glanced at Diana, struck by her beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thought crossed Yvette's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt that there was something off between Steven and that woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, do you have a thing for that woman?" she asked, her tone amused.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven raised an eyebrow, but before he could respond, Yvette continued slowly, "But judging by the way she's looking at the man with her, she seems very fond of him. They make a perfect match."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's face went dark. Seeing his expression, Yvette looked startled.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan took a discreet step back, thinking Yvette was being dangerously bold.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could tell that Steven was growing more invested in Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, their main purpose was to secure the contract with the King family. Steven intended to settle everything else once that was done.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Yvette had just returned to the country, Evan wasn't familiar with her, but because Owen had introduced her, he decided to be patient.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, if the boss could tolerate her, so could he.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven suddenly turned to Yvette, his voice icy. "You think those two are a perfect match?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="747.html">« Prev</a><a href="749.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
