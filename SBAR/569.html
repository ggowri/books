She cried out, her voice shaky with desperation, "Gale, you have to help me! Diana set me up! She's framing me! I've been arrested!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean, Diana set you up?" Gale's voice was filled with confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She... she framed me for stealing a child..." Penelope sobbed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix, listening in, couldn't take it anymore. He interjected, "Miss, we allowed you to call your family because you're pregnant. We're filing charges, and you're claiming you're the victim? You planned to kidnap my son for a ransom of 10 million dollars! Are you saying someone forced you to send those texts?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're the one who orchestrated the ransom demand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were after Althea's child, but you ended up with the wrong one because they switched rooms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And somehow, that's Diana's fault? Do you think we're just going to ignore the evidence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Gale exclaimed, thinking, "Why would Penelope want to steal Althea's child?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When did Althea even get pregnant?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the baby's already here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale's voice trembled with urgency as he asked, "Officer, is Althea's child just a newborn?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix said, "Sir, the child was born yesterday. This lady claims to be your girlfriend. We need you to come down here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix was seething. His son was in danger, but he forced himself to remain calm and focused on the facts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, but she's not my girlfriend. The baby she's carrying isn't mine either. She just wants me to step in and take the role. I'm not her family," Gale replied coolly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope's face fell, shock washing over her. "Gale, what are you saying? The baby in my belly is yours! Now that I'm in trouble, you're backing away? You said you loved me! You promised you'd marry me! You can't just abandon me like this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale roared, his anger boiling over, "Penelope, Queenie told me everything. Do you dare to have the baby and get a paternity test? Call David Federer. Maybe he'll come to your rescue since you're carrying his child. You and he plotted against me, hoping I'd be the fool. Do you really think I'm that easy to manipulate?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gale, no! That's not how it is! This is all Queenie's doing. She's the one who made me do this! You can't just take her word for it&mdash;she's the one who planned everything!" Penelope pleaded, desperation lacing her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale cut her off, his voice heavy with hurt. "I treated you so well, and you turned around and slept with countless other guys, then humiliated me. The child you're carrying is a result of your reckless choices, and now you want to keep it as a bargaining chip?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"David knows everything about you, but he doesn't want you because you're 'damaged goods.' You both thought you could play me for a fool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've taken the time to uncover the truth, and I can't believe I was blind to your games. I was giving you 50 thousand a month just to keep you steady while I figured this out. I was going to wait until the baby was born to get a paternity test, but I never expected you'd stoop so low as to steal someone else's child for ransom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope broke down, her voice rising in a frantic plea. "Gale, I know you love me! You have to help me, or I swear I'll let your son die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Penelope had no choice but to dangle Althea as a threat over Gale to get his help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale's eyes widened in shock. "What do you mean by that, Penelope?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="568.html">« Prev</a><a href="570.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
