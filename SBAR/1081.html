Who are you calling?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glared at George. "Useless. You can't even hide your identity!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George defended himself aggrievedly, "Dad, Yvette is my girlfriend, you know that. Stop talking, just give her the special medicine first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gently patted her cheek and said, "Yvette, remember my identity when you see me in the future. Don't call me randomly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvette responded, "Alright!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When she looked at Andrew, a trace of fear flashed in his eyes. He always made her feel a deep sense of dread.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I understand. Give me the special medicine first." Her voice unconsciously lowered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She absolutely couldn't let anything happen to her parents.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew threw out three doses of the special medicine and said, "Get lost!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvette was furious but didn't dare to speak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She dared to mess with George, but she wouldn't provoke Andrew; he was too terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvette's goal was the special medicine; after getting it, she turned and left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie quickly turned around at the door and hid behind it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The hurried Yvette didn't notice Queenie hiding in the shadows.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Murderous intent surged in Queenie's eyes; she hadn't expected his lover outside to be Yvette.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Andrew and George inside checking big data, Queenie's eyes flickered with indifference. She didn't go in to disturb them but quietly left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George hid something from her, so she no longer needed to be honest with him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie let out a cold laugh and dialed the tip-off hotline. She felt it was time to end everything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew must die.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie quickly left after making the tip-off call.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two hours later, Diana finally woke up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, she still couldn't open her eyes. She barely propped herself up to sit, feeling utterly weak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had always been a heavy sleeper; after a tiring day, she could sleep for three days and nights, let alone this time after staying up for three whole days.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing her open her eyes, Steven gently reminded, "Diana, get some more rest. The issue with Tom has been resolved. He's back in the lab, and we've also secured the patent for the special medicine."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And I reported that company. Guess who I found out was behind it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana fought off her drowsiness and asked in confusion, "Steven, was it Andrew?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven nodded slightly and said, "I suspect it's him, but I don't have proof yet."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Diana felt as if everything was under his control. "Steven, since everything is in your hands, I'll leave it to you. I need to sleep now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had already developed the special medicine; the rest was up to the relevant departments and his abilities.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They must eliminate the Mysterium Organization as soon as possible; they are scum harming society.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven gently said to her, "Sleep. Leave the rest to me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had complete faith in his abilities.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as she was about to close her eyes, something came to mind, so she sent Joseph a message telling him to keep resting.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After she lay down, Steven went back to work.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, he received a message.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After reading the message, a trace of disbelief flashed in Steven's deep eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Is he still alive?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's phone fell onto the carpet with a dull thud.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew was immersed in joy, but he suddenly received a call from the company.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Andrew Gellar, something's wrong! The company was raided, and the lab's violations were caught on the spot by the authorities. What should we do now?" Andrew's assistant was on the verge of breaking down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew was stunned, thinking, "How could we have been discovered?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had clearly done everything flawlessly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew roared, "Useless! What are you doing? Didn't I tell you to smooth things over? Why are we still being investigated?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I did go, but as soon as I got back, I ran into the shutdown. Mr. Andrew Gellar, please think of a solution quickly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's worse, they found the virus source in our lab. Mr. Gellar is doomed this time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The virus samples have been taken away, and experts can easily confirm they're linked to us. Mr. Andrew Gellar, I told you long ago this plan was too risky."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not everyone can make this kind of money against their conscience. Do you know how many people have died in these four days? Over hundreds of thousands! If they all died because of us, I really can't bear this guilt."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Andrew Gellar, think of a solution quickly! We're about to go to jail. Several senior professors in the lab have all been arrested. Although they won't confess easily, the evidence is conclusive."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew was stunned, his eyes filled with murderous intent. "Impossible! How could I fail? How could this be discovered?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Didn't I tell you to destroy the samples? Why are they still in the lab? Fred, what did you do?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fred Poehler cried, "Mr. Andrew Gellar, I really threw it in the trash. I don't know how it ended up in the lab, and the authorities just happened to see it. If the test results match the virus, I'll have to go to jail. Think of something quickly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew was completely shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hurriedly hung up the phone, turned to George, and said, "Get out of here quickly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George panicked and said, "Dad, what's going on? Why do you want me to leave?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew replied, "Don't ask too much, just leave through the back door. If I get arrested, I'll transfer all my assets to you. Don't worry about me. Take care of my wife and live well with your sister."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All these years, he was just a playboy, and he seemed irresponsible, but it was all to protect his wife and children.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for the other illegitimate children, he could no longer care about them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dad, you can't let anything happen to you. If something happens to you, what will I do?" George never expected things to escalate so quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew frowned, "Hurry up. Stop talking! Live under Steven's identity after you leave. You've recently signed several big deals and already established yourself. You have a bright future. Go now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew looked at him worriedly and said, "You are my proudest son. Back then, I modified your genes to make you look exactly like Steven for this very day. Go now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George had no choice but to flee in haste.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew transferred all the funds into George's overseas account.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He held the computer, about to leave, and looked around the office reluctantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over the years, he had enjoyed unprecedented wealth and luxury here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he ultimately reached this point.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, a cold voice came from the doorway. "Charlie, you can't leave today."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1080.html">« Prev</a><a href="1082.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
