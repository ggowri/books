"Paula, haven't you always looked down on my son? Thought he wasn't good enough, just because he joined your family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tracey, what are you saying? When did I ever say he wasn't good enough for me? If I didn't respect him, would I have been giving you ten thousand every month as an allowance? Would I have funded his company? I've provided for your entire family to keep up appearances and helped every relative of yours I could. I've made countless sacrifices, without a single 'thank you' or 'well done.' Now that I'm in trouble, you all turn on me?" She stared at Tracey's harsh expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tracey's face hardened. She couldn't ignore the help Paula had provided all these years, but that only made her feel more indebted and resentful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She narrowed her eyes. With Paula's wealth gone, Tracey was finally in control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tracey forgot the days, two decades prior, when she and her family had been penniless, crammed into a tiny two-room apartment, struggling just to put food on the table. Without Paula, they would have remained stuck in that life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guilt on Tracey's face completely disappeared and was replaced by a face full of pride and complacency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paula, you can't put it that way. You married my son, didn't you? That makes us family. Supporting us financially was only right. But now you're broke, you're a burden. As for that one-billion-dollar debt? It's your problem. Leave my son's company out of it. Go pack your things and get out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divorce him immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula looked at her, horror-struck, as if Tracey had just uttered the cruelest words imaginable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tracey, however, felt no remorse. Thoughts of Paula's staggering debts had killed whatever pity she might have had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, it's nothing personal, Paula. Leopold and I are old, and Jeff's health is failing, and we need his company to pay for his treatment. You'll have to figure out your debts on your own. Go on, divorce him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula remained rooted to the spot, stunned. After a moment, tears began to fall. She turned to Jeff, her voice barely above a whisper. "Is this really how it is, Jeff? You're willing to share wealth, but not hardship?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff hadn't expected the topic to come up this way, but now that it was out in the open, he felt relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cared about Paula; she was gentle, kind, and supportive, never going too far. But deep down, he was drawn to his childhood sweetheart, Amelie, the one who'd captured his heart long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking down, he sighed with guilt. "Paula, it's not that I don't care. It's just... with such a huge debt, I don't know how to help. If I cover it, what about the kids? What about my parents? My siblings?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart, already worn, cracked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew how cold he could be, but facing his indifference was a harsh, bitter reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jeff, I'm your wife. I've stood by you through everything. And yet, I mean less to you than your brothers and sisters, who I've supported all these years?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="553.html">« Prev</a><a href="555.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
