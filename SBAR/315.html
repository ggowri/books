Her voice was barely above a whisper, "Alexander, we've got to lose him. He can't follow me back."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seemed she needed to keep her distance from Alexander.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No one knew Steven's ruthlessness better than she did. Alexander's position was still shaky, and she couldn't let Steven take advantage of him now.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven'd grown up in a loveless home, with even his father plotting against him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His mother had been driven insane by the pressure.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was only thanks to Edward's protection that he'd managed to grow up healthy.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During those dark days, Queenie had been by his side. She was the light in his life.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana understood how important Queenie was to Steven.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He doted on Queenie, and she really had no right to complain.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she couldn't understand why Steven wouldn't divorce her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had nothing left to threaten Steven with, so she could only wait two years to file for divorce herself.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander shot her a glance, then said with a smile, "Don't worry, Diana. I'll shake him off. He won't bother you anymore."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana forced a smile. "Thank you, Alexander."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I told you to cut it out with the formalities. Keep this up and I might just get mad."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana glanced up suddenly, taking in his chiseled profile. A warm feeling spread through her chest.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's driving skills were top-notch. Within 20 minutes, he'd completely lost Steven.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Realizing he couldn't keep up, Steven pulled over to the side of the road, his eyes dark with anger.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How dare she run?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven drove home, his face like thunder.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Outside Steven's villa, Queenie punched in the code.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After two failed attempts, she turned to Evan in surprise. "Did Steven change the password?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan shook his head. "I've no idea, Ms. Marsh."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie let out a sneer, looking Evan up and down. "I know you don't like me, Evan. You're always taking shots at me. But let me remind you - you're just Steven's lapdog. I'm his future wife. If you want to keep your job, open this door."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven changing the password had caught her off guard.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before, she could come and go as she pleased. Even Diana couldn't do anything about it.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven had always doted on her without question.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, it seemed everything had changed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Panic seized Queenie's heart.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan's gaze was icy, his voice dripping with sarcasm. "Ms. Marsh, you think so highly of yourself that you need my help to open a door? Please, open it yourself, Ms. Marsh. I really don't know the password."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="314.html">« Prev</a><a href="316.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
