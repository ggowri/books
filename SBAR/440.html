You're her brother, but to save yourself, you're willing to hand her over to us? That's truly malicious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After tonight, you won't belong in our circle anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric's expression darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you hadn't beaten me up and demanded a million dollars, none of this would have happened."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it came down to it, he'd have to call Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie had told him that because of Diana, Gale was disabled and their Frank was missing&mdash;all because of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That woman better not leave this place alive tonight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Under the thick night sky, the cold wind pierced through.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the racetrack, an exhilarating car race began.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nearby, a large screen displayed the racing scenes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the race started, the roar of engines was deafening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Two cars shot out like arrows released from bows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The tires screeched against the asphalt, sending plumes of smoke into the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Diana's red car was swerving uncontrollably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ha!" a boy laughed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She can drive, but she's slower than a turtle! Boss is almost at the finish line."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric scoffed. "What a clown; she's embarrassing the Marsh family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Come on, you don't know anything. If boss loses, she has to be his secret lover for a year. Diana can't seriously think she'll become boss's woman, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Another man crossed his arms and chuckled. "She's pretty; boss wouldn't be losing out. If I were him, I'd consider myself lucky. She's beautiful, fit, and brave&mdash;she'd make a great wife."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The speaker was handsome, dressed in a white casual shirt and black pants, exuding youthful energy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not far away, Steven Gellar watched with a solemn expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at the screen. Diana's car was left far behind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Did she really want to become Elroy's woman?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, you have quite the appetite," Steven glared, full of anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He could see her movements in the driver's seat&mdash;awkward, as if she didn't know how to handle the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ugh... our boss's got this in the bag.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Eric, your Marsh family is a joke tonight. Competing without knowing how to race? You're going to be a lifelong laughingstock in this circle."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric watched Diana's embarrassing performance, wanting to run over and strangle her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yay! Boss is winning!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man turned to the nearby bodyguard. "Go grab some beers and get some barbecue. Let's celebrate boss' big win tonight!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The bodyguard nodded and went off to prepare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, an unexpected scene unfolded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The red car, which had been swerving, suddenly seemed to fly as it skillfully drifted around a turn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The car nearly grazed the edge of the track.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From the large screen, it was clear that Diana's vehicle was accelerating, the engine roaring like thunder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Every gear shift and turn showcased her impressive driving skills.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the most challenging series of curves, she maneuvered expertly, speeding through with precision.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone watched in astonishment as the previously hidden blue car reappeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon seeing Elroy's car, everyone held their breath in anticipation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was going too fast, her gear shifts dazzling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was attempting a final comeback.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="439.html">« Prev</a><a href="441.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
