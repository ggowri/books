Steven's affection for her had been unwavering.&#8203;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A few years ago, he was injured, and she left because she was certain that he would always love her and wait for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But this time, she was unsure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana returned to her office and asked Luna to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wanted to be alone. She sat on the floor in front of the floor-to-ceiling window, staring at the bright sunshine outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But her heart sank. Her face revealed her sadness, and her beautiful, big eyes became unfocused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hated this kind of life and still more the endless intrigues.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, the society was always complicated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana just planned to be furious for a while and did not compromise with life. Even if everyone betrayed her, she would still be brave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In this life, she desired a long, wonderful life. She also wanted to marry a man who was devoted to her and get her baby back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tears streamed down her face. She raised her eyes and wiped them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She couldn't hold them back. Though unwilling to cry, she shed tears anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana took a deep breath and fixed her eyes on the dense, towering buildings outside the window. All half of her depression suddenly disappeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She stood up and wanted to shout a few times. In the end, she said in a trembling and choked voice, "Diana, come on!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wept and laughed and was at last relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was just betrayed by her family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was okay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No matter how close someone was to her, there would be times when they sold her out for their own benefit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana had experienced a lot in her previous life, so there was no need to be sad in this life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After figuring it out, she went to the bathroom to wash her face. Then, she came out and continued to draw the design drafts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The cooperation with the Powell Group was imminent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana contacted Alexander and told him that the design drawings had been stolen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander was abroad. He comforted her and then hung up the phone in a hurry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Knowing how busy he was, she didn't disturb him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff got up late today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The glaring sunlight outside made it difficult for him to open his eyes, and he was still very tired. For a moment, he was confused about where he was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, he felt his lower body wet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment of bewilderment, he became completely sober.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He sat up abruptly, lifted the quilt, and caught a strong smell of urine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff screamed in horror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The damp bed sheets drove him crazy. He was an adult. How could he wet his pants like a kid?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh no..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While Jeff was shocked, the door was suddenly pushed open.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula walked in, and he quickly covered himself with the quilt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She frowned and asked, "What's that smell? Why is it so stinky?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff's face flushed with embarrassment, and he shook his head. "Nothing. Paula, haven't you gone to work yet?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He forced a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula explained, "I arrived at the company only to find that I had left a document at home, so I came back to get it. You were nowhere to be seen, so I came in. Don't you care about the company's affairs? Why have you slept until now? You have been working for this company for decades, but you haven't performed well." She shook her head helplessly and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff breathed a sigh of relief when the door closed with a click.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a long face, he wondered what was wrong with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He quickly got out of bed, got dressed, and opened the door of the wardrobe. His face betrayed his fear.&#8203;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="222.html">« Prev</a><a href="224.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
