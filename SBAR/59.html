I've already sent the video to Cecil. If that fool doesn't believe it after seeing the video, I'll find a way to deal with him," Luna's voice was icy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nolan had everything ready. Diana patted Luna's arm and smiled reassuringly, "Don't worry! Cecil isn't that clueless. Let's head inside first. I'll call you later, and then you can bring him in."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna nodded and sent another video to Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Steven drove directly to the Marsh Villa. Olivia and Diana took their time walking in, while Cecil arrived with ten bodyguards.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The hall was crowded. As Diana and her companions entered, Queenie ran over, crying, and clung to Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, you're finally here. You have to help me. I haven't done anything against the Farley family," Queenie pleaded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven gently patted her back but couldn't help glancing at Diana. Her indifferent expression, devoid of any emotion, sparked an inexplicable anger within him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why are you framing Queenie, Diana?" Jeff demanded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula, who had initially felt a twinge of guilt, quickly lost it upon hearing the accusation against Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why are you so malicious, Diana? I regret giving birth to you. If I had known you'd turn out this way, I should have strangled you at birth," Paula said, looking at Diana with disappointment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt a sharp pang in her heart. Olivia was shocked, thinking, "Is this really something a mother should say?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie, nestled in Steven's arms, flashed a triumphant smile. "Diana, today is your downfall," she thought. She had anticipated Cecil's arrival and made arrangements in advance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil looked at Diana, thinking, "You humiliated me that day. Today, you'll pay for it. Attempted murder&mdash;you're going to jail!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a sinister look, he confronted Diana. "Diana, weren't you arrogant that night? You broke my hands and slapped me ten times. You didn't expect me to find evidence, did you? It was you who did it, and now you're framing Queenie."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sneered at his foolishness. He could have known the truth if he bothered to check. But even geniuses have their moments of ignorance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Cecil received a video on his phone. After watching it, his anger boiled over. He realized Queenie had tried to trick him again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia smiled, "Mr. Farley, why not call the police? It would be fairer with them involved."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil, captivated by Olivia's beauty, agreed. "Alright! Since the lovely lady suggests it, I'll call the police," he said, dialing the number.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two men on the ground panicked upon hearing about the police.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One pointed at Olivia and accused, "Diana, you ordered us. You should be the one going to jail."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia was taken aback, as was everyone else. Queenie gritted her teeth, frustrated. "This fool! What is he doing?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia, her eyes flashing with anger, asked, "Are you sure you've seen me? Did I really give you a million dollars?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Desperate to shift the blame onto Diana, the man insisted, "Yes, I'm sure. You gave us half a million each to attack Madam Farley's bodyguard."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was stunned. She cursed internally, "These idiots! How could they confuse the wrong person?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia's eyes flared with anger as she questioned, "Have you really seen me? Did I really give you a million dollars?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man, never having seen Diana, assumed Olivia was her when she stepped forward. "Yes, it was you!" he insisted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven pushed Queenie aside and approached the man with a fierce expression. "Are you sure she's Diana?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man, intimidated by Steven's icy demeanor, stammered, "I'm sure. She paid us to frame Ms. Marsh."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven glared at him, a fleeting murderous intent in his eyes. Had he misunderstood Diana again? He turned to look at her, her face calm, her eyes indifferent. A sense of panic arose in him&mdash;it seemed he had misjudged her once more.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil realized Queenie was scheming to frame Diana again. "Queenie, knowing I was coming, you staged this with accomplices to frame Diana. How malicious can you be?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil squinted at Queenie, who was paralyzed with fear. She cursed internally, "These idiots ruined everything!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She cried out, "Mr. Farley, it's not like that. Please listen to me. They identified Diana. This has nothing to do with me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia sneered, "Identified? You must have shown them Diana's picture when bribing them. Otherwise, they wouldn't have mistaken someone else, and you wouldn't have been caught."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie glared at Olivia, as beautiful as Diana. It was her envy of Diana's beauty that fueled her hatred.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who are you? This is my home. You have no right to interfere in my family's affairs."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia's sneer deepened, her beauty even more striking. She looked at Queenie with a mocking smile, her eyes cold. "I am the Diana they mentioned, the victim in those accidents. Don't I have the right to speak?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie glared at her fiercely.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unnoticed by anyone, Olivia discreetly cast a truth serum on one of the men.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil swaggered over and kicked the man to the ground. "Who ordered you to attack my bodyguard? Tell me now, or I'll break your legs."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Terrified, the man pointed at Queenie. "It was her! Queenie paid us a million dollars to frame Diana. We were just in it for the money. Please spare me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't understand why he was compelled to tell the truth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was speechless with anger. She thought viciously, "How dare you tell the truth? You're asking for death!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Diana, who had remained silent, stepped forward and played a video.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="58.html">« Prev</a><a href="60.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
