"That bastard, what is he making a fuss about? Ruin his reputation, and make sure the Robinson family gets acquired. I want Levi to lose everything, with no one to turn to."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only he had acknowledged the child she was carrying back then, she wouldn't have pushed him to that point. But what did he do? After he used her, he didn't want to take responsibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she realized there was no such thing as true love in this world. She loved George, but it seemed he never intended to marry her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since his return, he never expressed any intention of marrying her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was smart enough to see that, from the beginning, she had always been a pawn to the father and son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more she thought about it, the more frustrated she became. The years she had spent were wasted, and she felt like she had been cheated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sandra was excited. "That's great, Ms. Marsh. Leave this to me. I won't let you down. I'll make sure to take down the entire Robinson family, and I won't fail you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people Queenie kept around her were all ambitious, each one eager to rise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Felicity gone, it had cleared a path for Sandra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would now work even harder to please Queenie and become her right-hand person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was something Queenie had expected all along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt pleased hearing this, and now she was ready to take on Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only through overcoming difficulties can one truly reach greatness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how excellent Diana was, in the end, she would become nothing more than her defeated foe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had once been bathed in light, but now, she was ready to become the light herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sandra, find out who acquired the other four branches. If they didn't suddenly appear, with your ability, you should have been able to take over the company entirely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had originally planned to acquire all of Zion's companies, but someone had beaten her to it. She hadn't expected it at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sandra also felt confused. "Ms. Marsh, I don't know who they are. Their actions were faster than ours. By the time I arrived, they had already left."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's gaze turned cold as she looked out the window. "Find out who they are. I want to know who is stealing my company from me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sandra quickly assured her, "I will investigate as soon as the paperwork is finalized here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Queenie hung up the phone, feeling somewhat reassured after hearing her promise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then turned to Mario and said, "Mario, your task is to sabotage all of Diana's upcoming collaborations. Find a way to bribe the people working in her lab. Money makes the world go round."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario understood and was eager to take action. He gave a sly smile. "Ms. Marsh, I have a plan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For her, he would do anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie knew Mario's talents and wouldn't let them go to waste. He was someone who had stayed by her side and would walk with her until the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mario, you've been with me for so long. I'm raising your annual salary from one million to two million dollars. Thank you for staying with me all these years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remembered in her dreams that, until the end, it was always him by her side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario was deeply touched and was on the verge of tears. "Ms. Marsh, thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't care about the salary. What mattered to him was staying by her side forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smiled gently, her voice soft. "Let's go. We're heading back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario was momentarily stunned. "Ms. Marsh, aren't we going to see the master tonight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smiled bitterly and looked at Mario, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears. "Mario, I'm not naive enough to place all my hopes on him. He's just using me. He might have feelings for me, but he's using me more than anything. Let's go back. I don't want to see him these next couple of days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, what do you mean by that?" George's angry voice suddenly rang out, his handsome face turning pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't you want to see me? What did I do wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She activated her wheelchair and turned to face his striking features. She gave a bitter smile. He had the same face as Steven but lacked the same capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The saddest thing was that he was someone who had betrayed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Queenie felt an impulse to slap him hard across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"George, the reason I don't want to see you is simple. When I needed you the most, you were never there. I don't even know where you were," she smiled bitterly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George stepped forward, crouching down in front of her. He looked at her face, which was filled with a bitter smile. "Queenie, we've loved each other for so long. Do I have to teach you how to look at me so you'll understand my feelings?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears filled Queenie's eyes, and at that moment, she felt like that day was the second darkest moment of her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first was when Paula exposed her as an illegitimate daughter. It truly broke her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second time, it was again Paula who exposed everything about her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face wore a desolate smile, and her voice was colder than before. "George, if you loved me, how could you never be by my side when I needed you most?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven is different. When I was wronged, he always stood by me, always fought for justice on my behalf."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing her compare him to Steven, even though George was broad-minded, at that moment, his heart was filled with rage. "Steven is dead. Queenie, did you fall in love with him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was laced with bitterness, his gaze locked firmly on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still remembered the moment when Andrew brought Queenie before him. Her radiant smile, like a flower in bloom, made his heart fall for her from that instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had met her earlier than Steven did. She was the light in his lonely life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could she think that Steven was stronger than him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George tightly gripped Queenie's shoulders, warning her, "Queenie, for the rest of your life, your eyes should only have me. I have something to handle today, but once it's settled, I'll come to see you right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, don't you dare doubt my feelings for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His handsome face darkened, making her momentarily dazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if she could see Steven, the way he cared for her, how good he had been to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only now that she saw through George's false affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sneered, lowering her gaze to his angry, handsome face. She found it all ridiculous. She wasn't his only woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was slightly stunned and narrowed his eyes at her. "Queenie, what are you laughing at?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie gazed at him deeply. Now she understood his heart, but at that moment, they had to unite. Being with George could at least frustrate Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Steven was already dead, and George was the one who resembled him most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gave a slight shake of her head. "Nothing. George, Zion is finished. There's no trace left behind. Our project should start soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were many business entanglements between them. Either they severed the businesses or made them hers, and she preferred the latter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she thought about how he had only appeared now, she smiled and asked, "George, where have you been today?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="991.html">« Prev</a><a href="993.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
