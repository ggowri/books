The happiness she longed for had never come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't the outcome she wanted. Everything was ruined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was still just an illegitimate child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie glared fiercely at Diana and Paula. "Paula, no matter what you do, you've broken Diana's heart. She will never acknowledge you as her mother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know why?" Queenie asked with a malicious smile, her gaze fixed on Paula's pained face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula stared back, saying nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason was simple. She'd brought this upon herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her feelings were conflicted at the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Paula remain silent, Queenie continued, "You think she doesn't accept you because of me? Do you think this is all my fault? Haven't you ever considered your own actions? You knew she was your biological daughter. You know she came from the countryside. Even you, her mother, looked down on her. How could anyone else respect her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven was a man of status. How could he possibly care for a girl from the countryside?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paula, your current situation isn't solely my fault. Everyone is responsible for their own choices. You chose me over your biological daughter, and maybe that wasn't a mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But why pin all the blame on me? You indulged me because you wanted to. That's on you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you honestly say you never despised her when you learned where she came from?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You didn't just look down on her. You humiliated her deliberately. Clothes I didn't like, hand-me-downs I refused to wear, you gave them to her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You spent 5 million dollars on custom couture for me, but for her, you bought a 200-dollar down jacket. And still, Diana treated your family well. Paula, when you did all that, you were already pushing your daughter into despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Were those things my orders? Weren't they your own doing? So why blame me for everything?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's furious questioning exposed the truth. She might be cruel, but Paula and Gale weren't blameless either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula froze. Those things had indeed happened. At Queenie's instigation, she had done countless unforgivable things to Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes reddened as she lowered her gaze, not daring to meet Diana's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana, for her part, didn't even glance at them. She focused on finishing her breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale also regretted his actions. He couldn't understand why he had treated his own sister so cruelly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana calmly finished her croissant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tossed the wrapper into a nearby trash can, then looked toward the people outside. "This is a hospital. If you want to argue, take it elsewhere. Don't disturb the patients."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was cold and devoid of emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula finally looked at Diana. "Diana... I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to explain, but the truth was undeniable. Any explanation would be an excuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the beginning, she truly hadn't wanted Diana back. Diana's return had shattered all her illusions of happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana waved dismissively, her expression indifferent. She had given up on these so-called family members long ago. Their newfound remorse didn't matter to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Barnes, have I not told you to stay away from me? I don't bother you, so please respect my choices."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I want to make it up to you. Just give me a chance," Paula pleaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was rare even to get a chance to see her now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "I don't need your apologies. You didn't raise me for a single day, and I've already repaid you. Let's leave it at that. We can live our lives separately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Diana, their presence was nothing but a nuisance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all adults. Surely, they could live just fine without each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula wanted to say more, but when she saw the icy detachment in Diana's eyes, she fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps leaving Diana alone was the last bit of kindness she could offer as a mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was brilliant, truly brilliant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their favoritism had dimmed her light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula hadn't even allowed Diana to dress nicely, fearing she might outshine Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie wore 5 million dollar custom diamond ensembles, while Diana received cheap clothing worth only a few hundred dollars. Paula realized now that she had utterly failed as a mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a quiet voice, Paula said, "Diana, if you ever face trouble, don't forget you can come to me. I'll always be your mother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need. I'm better off without you. Don't feel bad about it; we were never meant to be. Just pretend I was never your daughter. These two years since I returned haven't brought you any joy, have they?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe that's just our fate. Take care of yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana spoke with a calmness that felt like she was addressing a stranger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula's heart ached deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, Paula pushed Gale's wheelchair and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie and Jeff stayed behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie glanced at Steven sitting in the room and walked in. "Steven, why are you here instead of being with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice dripped with intentional intimacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven cast her a cold look. "Queenie, was I unclear before, or are you just deaf?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana, who was about to leave, sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sneered. "Oh? Are you putting on another act?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at them. Their performance wasn't bad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two carry on. I'm leaving," Diana said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the door, she turned to Luna. "Luna, aren't you coming?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna quickly got out of bed. "Diana, wait! I'm coming with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan jumped out of bed, too. "Luna, hold on for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he put on his shoes, Evan addressed Queenie. "Ms. Marsh, if you don't want me to sue you for kidnapping, pay 10 million dollars into my account."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just seeing Queenie made him shiver. He had sensed danger before, and yesterday, it had come true. It had been terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was livid. "Evan, are you and Paige in on this together?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan paused, then smirked as she trembled with rage. "In on it? I based it on your net worth. For someone as wealthy as you, asking for less would've been an insult."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was exasperated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got to be kidding me!" She thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan darted after Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven sighed in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said he and Queenie were acting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven didn't stoop to such things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rose and looked at Queenie with frosty eyes. "Get out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie froze. She grabbed his sleeve quickly. No matter what, if Steven sided with her, she could still spite Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tears streamed down her face as she pleaded, "Steven, I know I was wrong about yesterday. Please forgive me. I won't do it again. You promised to marry me. Are you going back on your word now?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="876.html">« Prev</a><a href="878.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
