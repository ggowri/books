Diana gasped as she jolted awake, the sunlight streaming through the window. She grabbed her phone and quickly called Olivia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, get some more rest. I'm almost at the airport," Olivia said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm sorry, Olivia. I overslept and couldn't see you off. I'm really sorry!" Diana said apologetically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana felt guilty. The recurring nightmare had kept her trapped in sleep, making her miss the chance to see Olivia off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, don't worry about me. Tobias brought me to the airport. I'll be back soon," Olivia reassured her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing that Tobias had taken Olivia to the airport made Diana happy. "Alright, Olivia. Stay safe abroad, and call me if you need anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Olivia cheerfully replied, "Of course, I'll call you if I need anything. You're my only friend, Diana. The future will get better, so don't be too sad."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana realized that Olivia must have heard her crying the night before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled and said, "Alright!" After chatting a bit more, she hung up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana didn't rest any further. She got up, freshened up, and drove out. She needed to see Althea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana found Althea on a small island in the south.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By the time she arrived, the sunset was beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The island's scenery was serene, making Diana feel at ease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She and her car took a ferry to the island, then drove for another 20 minutes to Althea's seaside villa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea came from a wealthy family, but she worked hard on her own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While her parents and brother ran the family business, she worked at a relevant company, gaining experience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was a tourism project on the island, which was why she chose to live there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After becoming pregnant, she no longer wanted to see the Marsh family, so her family moved away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Diana saw her, Althea had just finished a meeting, now nearly eight months pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had become much fuller in figure, but her gentle smile remained as pure as ever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea was planning to take a walk on the island and have dinner afterward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The moment she saw Diana, Althea happily walked over, her eyes turning red. "Diana, is it really you? Am I seeing things?" she exclaimed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It had been a full nine months since they last met.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After returning to the Marsh Villa, Diana had the closest bond with Althea. No matter how much Queenie tried to provoke her, Althea always believed in Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because Althea believed in her, Gale disliked Althea, always suspecting that she wasn't a good person either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was obvious that he was blind and foolish, yet he tried to act all high and mighty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana walked over, her eyes red. Though it had only been nine months apart, to Diana, it felt like a century.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a low voice, she said, "Althea, you're not mistaken. It's me."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="250.html">« Prev</a><a href="252.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
