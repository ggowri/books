Instead, he started living with his childhood sweetheart and seldom went home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Who was that woman?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana thought she needed to meet Jenny.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She remembered that Andrew's childhood sweetheart seemed to be a few years younger than him. After they got married, he held a grand proposal ceremony for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew was so scary. He swallowed up everything from Steven's grandmother's family, but he could still eat with Steven calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He himself knew that the relationship between him and Steven could not be repaired.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In this situation, Andrew could only abandon Steven and let his illegitimate sons take charge of the Gellar Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But as long as Edward was alive, Andrew's illegitimate sons would never have the chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Edward gave all of his shares to Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was a smart man. He knew that if he held the shares, his life would be in danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shook her head, thinking Steven was an unlucky guy, and she herself was even more unlucky.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After finishing eating, Diana went back to say goodbye to Cecil, who had made an appointment with his friends to go to the bar in the evening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, come with me to the bar. My friends all want to meet you." Cecil looked at Diana with expectant eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shook her head. She wanted to go back to draw the design. "I can't go with you. I don't like bars. I have to go back to work. You can go and have fun by yourself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We are at the age to have fun. Why do you make yourself so tired? Go and relax." Cecil said. He liked to go to the bar at night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if he went home, he would play games, which was not much fun.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana still refused, and her mind was a little confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I'll go by myself. Be careful on your way back." Cecil took his coat and went downstairs with Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they got downstairs, Diana's cell phone rang. She saw it was Leopold, and she answered the video call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grandpa, have you had dinner?" Diana asked with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, I just had dinner. The seafood here is good. I will bring you some when I come back." Leopold smiled lovingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana also smiled happily, "Grandpa, have fun."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I see a handsome boy next to you." Leopold's voice became excited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana pointed the camera at Cecil, fearing that Leopold would misunderstand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She smiled, "Grandpa, you know Cecil. He invited me to dinner tonight, and I'm out now. Don't think too much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Leopold clapped his arms, smiling happily. "Cecil is very handsome. You did a great job. You finally cheated on that bastard Steven. If you like Cecil, talk to him more."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil grinned, thinking Leopold was so cute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He liked this kind of funny old man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grandpa, I'm Cecil." Cecil greeted Leopold formally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Cecil, I know your grandmother. She is an extraordinary person." Leopold smiled happily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil was a little arrogant. His grandmother was a famous rich lady, who was talented and was also a good swimmer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Leopold said, "Well, go on your date. I'm going to play."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying that, he hung up the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was helpless. Leopold was so naughty.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="354.html">« Prev</a><a href="356.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
