Why were they so surprised?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Evan, do you know her?" Emma thought that L.Q would lose its backbone after she left, but she didn't expect that she was so insignificant. L.Q found a new design director just a few minutes after she left.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan glanced at Steven and didn't dare to speak.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked extremely cold, which made the three of them feel breathless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan didn't say anything, so Emma didn't ask any more questions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "Evan, take Ms. Milton to the Human Resources Department to go through the entry procedures."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan said respectfully, "Ms. Milton, please!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma glanced at Steven and left reluctantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her target was Steven, so she came here without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven sat on the swivel chair like a statue and looked gloomy. Diana, who had left him, seemed to be empowered, and he almost couldn't recognize her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She could speak </span><span>Avernia's</span><span> language, was good at design, and had medical skills. Besides these, what else could she do?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven became more and more interested in Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edison stood aside and didn't dare to say a word. They all knew Steven's wife who couldn't be known.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They heard that Diana was from the countryside and didn't even finish her high school. When Steven found her, she was still covered in dirt. When she returned home, they also saw Diana, who was tanned, thin, and frumpy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They didn't know that during those two years, Diana had completed her studies early and was growing medicinal herbs in the countryside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one expected that she was a designer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She also became a design director suddenly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They found Diana was a hidden talent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, should I investigate it to make sure there is no mistake?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at Edison and said coldly, "Do you doubt my wife is incapable?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This shocked Edison. This was the first time he heard Steven admit that Diana was his wife.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Isn't Ms. Bishop from the countryside? I heard that she didn't finish her high school..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Have you ever heard of someone, who didn't even graduate from high school, can speak </span><span>Avernia's</span><span> language, has amazing medical skills, and can be a designer? Have you ever heard of it?" Steven asked in a casual voice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edison was stunned. Steven never defended Diana like this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What was going on today?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hadn't Steven always liked Queenie?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, to be the design director at L.Q company, she must be capable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't believe it. Diana was pretty, she could also make a living by using her face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But it seemed that he couldn't convince himself for this reason.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked doubtful, and a smile appeared on his face. He didn't understand Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said coldly, "Get out."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay." Edison left doubtfully.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven took out his cell phone and called Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her phone still couldn't get through.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wondered when Diana would stop this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He must see her today.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula went on a business trip to </span><span>Gowy</span><span> early in the morning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She sent a message to Jeff.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff frowned slightly when he saw the message and wondered why she suddenly went on a business trip.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was good that she went on a business trip, so he didn't have to come home these few days.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff sent a message to Paula: [Paula, thank you for your hard work. Please take care of yourself outside.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula was already sitting in the hospital, waiting for the results of the drug test and the paternity test.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When she saw the message sent by Jeff, she just felt disgusting.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She suspected that the detective she hired last time knew Jeff, so this time, she would investigate it herself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since her four sons were unreliable, she had to investigate on her own.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula waited for four hours.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She finally got the result.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because she only trusted this doctor, who was her college classmate Kevin White.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Paula, the results are out. You must have waited for a long time." Kevin was wearing a doctor's uniform. He had a good figure and handsome facial features. He looked at Paula and smiled gently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula smiled and shook her head, saying, "No, I work here, and time flies by. Have you tested the ingredients in the medicine I gave you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kevin looked cold and said, "Paula, who is this medicine for?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula didn't dare to meet his eyes and said, "Don't care about it, just tell me what's in it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kevin looked at her, did not ask any more questions, and said, "It contains a chronic poison. If you take too much of this medicine, you will get Alzheimer's disease. If you take it for more than a month, you will lose your hair and memory, and you will not be able to recognize people."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula was stunned, tears welling up in her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why did Jeff treat her like this?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She cursed in her heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula looked at Kevin's still handsome face and begged him, "Kevin, please don't tell anyone about my coming here today."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were good friends, and she came to see him because she trusted him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kevin looked at her and said, "Paula, we have been good friends for many years. If you need anything, you must tell me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula smiled, said goodbye to her, and left the hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't check the results on the way because she was afraid</span><span> that</span><span> she would be too sad.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was only when she returned to the hotel that she opened the paternity test results.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment she saw Queenie and Jeff were blood-related, she couldn't help but burst into tears.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wondered how could she be so stupid.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why would this happen?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had been deceived by Jeff for more than 20 years.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wanted him to live a life worse than death.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana reminded her, but she never believed Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, I'm sorry, I am sorry to you..." Paula was heartbroken.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of what she said last night, she felt even more shameful. How could she say such vicious words to her daughter?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Queenie and Jeff who were vicious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And her Diana had always been innocent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said to herself, "Jeff, you want my property? No way.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven, you lied to my daughter and wanted to marry Queenie, so I will help you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She would never let Diana live with people like Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was all her fault.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven and Queenie had been bullying Diana for the past year.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And she also bullied Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had endured so much injustice alone, no wonder she was so angry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula cursed herself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She deserved to die!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula took several deep breaths, calmed herself down, and called Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the call kept going unanswered, she lowered her eyes and burst into tears, it turned out that Diana had blocked her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana didn't want her anymore, and she still remembered the words that Diana said yesterday.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula lay on the bed, crying heart-wrenchingly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana did not draw the design today but dealt with company matters.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were too many people on the company's design team, and several of them had people to support them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After sorting out the important personnel in the company, Diana sent a list to Nolan.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>[Nolan, check these people, fire those who are unnecessary or take kickbacks, the company doesn't want to keep idle people.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nolan replied: [Okay!]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at the time. It was already eight o'clock in the evening and she had not had dinner yet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana got off work with Luna and prepared to go eat something nearby.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two went downstairs and the night breeze was very comfortable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stretched and said, "Luna, the office is not suitable for me at all. After cleaning out the termites in the company, I'd better draw the design at home."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna looked at Diana's tired face and said, "Ms. Bishop, it's because you are not in good health. You haven't rested well in the past few years."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I was young and ignorant. I almost lost my life trying to save someone who didn't deserve it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana didn't want to talk about the past anymore. "Don't mention the past anymore. I don't want to be tortured by the past. I've experienced so much pain, so I especially cherish my freedom and life now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana faced the evening breeze, the wind blew her hair, and her smile was beautiful.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna saw a rare smile appeared on Diana's cold face and said, "Ms. Bishop, let's go."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "Okay!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When she went out, she saw a tall figure. She paused and stood still.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="66.html">« Prev</a><a href="68.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
