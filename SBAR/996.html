There are four boys and two girls in the lab. They're all trustworthy.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't have the same confidence as Tom. She knew that Queenie was all-encompassing, always finding a way to sneak in. If this project launched, Queenie'd never be able to take back the Gellar Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana: [I understand. Tom, thank you for your hard work these days.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom: [It's no trouble! This is my dream. If it weren't for that scumbag Steven, this system would have launched a long time ago and benefited a lot of patients.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana gave an apologetic smile, even through the screen. She set the phone down and picked up the book on her desk, reading while waiting for Luna to return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was very quiet, with only the occasional sound of pages turning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After about forty minutes, Diana felt her shoulders becoming sore. She put the book down, stretched, and glanced at the clock. She thought, "Why hasn't Luna come back yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was about to call Luna, she heard a knock on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Knock knock..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, "Come in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna entered, dressed in a black suit that highlighted her perfect figure. Her long hair was tied up, and she walked confidently, striding over to Diana's side. "Diana, Levi went to meet Jace."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana wasn't surprised. Levi only had Jace left to turn to now, and Jace harbored the deepest hatred for Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Queenie had acted quickly. The Robinson family's project was already seized by her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Levi made Queenie pregnant but didn't accept the child in her womb. With such an insult, Queenie won't let him off easily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana gently rubbed her palm, playing with her fingers. "Levi is no good. He's bound to be a failure in this game, and Queenie will use him as a stepping stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From the moment Queenie got close to him, from the moment he protected her, he was doomed to lose."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was always lucky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's life was full of luck. She seemed like a child of destiny, able to get whatever she wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna was confused. "Diana, what's the point of him meeting Jace? Can Jace help the Robinson family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "No, he can't! But by cooperating with Jace, they can get back at Queenie. Even when things are at their end, they'll still take every chance to strike back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna sat across from Diana, bringing her a plate of grilled beef. "Diana, I passed by the grilled beef place you like on the way back, so I brought some for you. Eat a bit before bed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had already smelled the savory aroma of grilled meat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled, "Luna, are you trying to fatten me up since you think I'm too thin?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eating grilled meat late at night wasn't great for weight gain. She'd surely end up gaining some pounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna laughed. "Diana, just eat a little. It's no big deal. I bought you ten skewers. I ate sixteen myself. Mr. Farley ate twenty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The grilled beef shop you found is really good. Mr. Farley loves it and said he wants to go next time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn't help but smile, but the smell of the grilled meat made her mouth water. "Alright, alright, I'll eat and then go to sleep."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana picked up a skewer. The grilled meat from that shop was delicious, with a strong flavor, making it incredibly tasty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, do you think Levi can turn things around?" Luna asked. She had uncovered some of Levi's illegal activities. If they wanted to, they could send him to prison for most of his life. It was no surprise that Queenie was able to manipulate him so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "He won't turn things around. Jace won't be able to take revenge either. Do you think Queenie will let them succeed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna was shocked. "Diana, is Queenie really that powerful?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana narrowed her eyes, her voice becoming more serious. "Next, it's Owen and Yanson's turn. In Queenie's eyes, Steven is already dead. She won't let go of his two friends' fortunes. I've already warned Owen before, but I doubt he'll believe me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought about Owen's arrogant face, and even the grilled meat didn't taste as good anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was just so repellent. Just thinking about him made Diana feel disgusted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna sneered, "These two men are so detestable, especially Owen. He's always flirting with Yvette, and I even found records of them booking rooms together. Even worse, he introduced Yvette to Steven."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes widened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Great. Now, the grilled meat didn't taste good at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's stop talking about them. Go wash up and get some sleep. I'm going to the lab early tomorrow morning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna stood up with a smile. "Okay, Diana, I'm leaving. Mr. Farley is home safe. You don't need to worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded. "I'm not worried. Cecil's afraid of death. He's secretly being protected by a whole bunch of bodyguards."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about Cecil's fearful expression, Diana couldn't help but feel sorry for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching videos, she continued to eat the meat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today's trending topics included Levi being blacklisted in the entertainment industry. His sexual misconduct with female employees and assistants had been exposed, and it quickly climbed to the top of trending topics.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Below the post were the comments from netizens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Netizen A: [Levi, do you know how much I like you? How could you do something like this and break my heart?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Netizen B: [I was watching this movie for Levi, but he really let me down.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Netizen C: [He didn't disappoint us. Meeting Queenie, that bad luck star, dragging him down and pulling him off.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head as she read the comments. Levi had a lot of fans, but now he was losing them fast. This was Queenie's doing. She destroyed someone's future and made their family fall apart without taking any damage herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued reading for a bit and ate ten skewers of beef before suddenly feeling unsatisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt like Luna hadn't bought enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She picked up a glass of water and took a sip before heading to the bathroom to brush her teeth and get ready for bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stood in front of the mirror, looking at her pale face. She was still young, and when she smiled, she looked beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't think too much about it. She thought, "I have to respect the fate of others."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jace wasn't a good person either. The girl who got him sick was someone he had bullied back in the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the girl had come back for revenge, and he could only accept it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't dwell on it too much. After brushing her teeth, she went to bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back at home, George and Queenie had a heated moment in the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was exhausted, resting her head on George's muscular chest. George was always strong in this aspect, which was why she had needs in her relationship with him. Being with Levi felt completely different. Levi couldn't match George's strength, stamina, or skill, which gave her ultimate pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Queenie's tired expression, George chuckled softly and asked, "Queenie, why didn't you take pictures to annoy Diana this time?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="995.html">« Prev</a><a href="997.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
