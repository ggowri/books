Her smile was both pleased and elegant. "Jeff, you've got it all wrong. My multi-billion-dollar fortune is still intact. And not only that, my new company has made several hundred million dollars in profit over the past year. I'm the shining star you'll never be able to reach in this lifetime."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff stared at her in disbelief, struggling to take it in. He knew Paula was sharp in business&mdash;she was her father's prized prot&eacute;g&eacute;, groomed from a young age to be a force in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How had I been so easily fooled by her lies?" he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been so scared of the mounting debt that he'd quickly agreed to divorce her, convinced it would strip him of everything. The debt had terrified him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paula, you wanted me to walk away with nothing, and you went to all this trouble to set me up. You put a lot of thought into this, didn't you?" Jeff's eyes were reddened with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula was clever&mdash;so clever that she'd outplayed him completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sneered at him, watching his pathetic, self-pitying expression as if he had suffered great injustice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disgust she felt was overwhelming. She could barely stomach looking at him. Once trust and love were gone between two people, everything about them became repulsive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, when she looked at Jeff, she found him utterly repellent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jeff, you spent most of your life trying to scheme against me, while I only needed a few months to outmaneuver you. Not only did you end up with nothing, but I've made sure you're the one running with your tail between your legs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She surveyed him coldly. "Look at you now. Once upon a time, you had some semblance of dignity. But now, you're old, ugly, and greasy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff trembled with rage at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like a blow had struck him right in the chest, shattering his once-straight posture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lips quivered as he tried to speak, to defend himself, but his throat felt like it was being choked by an unseen force. He couldn't get a single word out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long silence, he finally exploded, his voice breaking with desperation. "Paula, no matter how much you look down on me, we shared a bed for over twenty years. That's a fact you can't change. No matter how much you despise me now, you can't erase the love and care you once showed me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was all he had to hold onto&mdash;his belief that their past might still matter to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Paula's response struck him like a slap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her lips curved into a cold smile, her eyes as icy as her words. "Jeff, I already told you, if I could go back I wish I'd never met you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused, letting her words sink in. "If it weren't for you chasing after me back then, you'd still be the same man you are now&mdash;nothing special."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a step back as if done with him. "Anyway, I'm finished here. You two are so in love, so go ahead and live happily ever after."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of thought, she added with a slight smirk, "Oh, how forgetful of me. Your undying love didn't survive the temptation of money. You two divorced long ago. And now, Mr. Jeff Marsh, you've got a young, beautiful wife."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Amelie with a mocking tone. "Amelie, you're back to being alone again. After all these years of being a woman, you never once did it with any dignity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Being a woman? You've failed at that too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Paula turned on her heel and walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula froze when she saw Diana at the door, sitting in a wheelchair with Cecil pushing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana," she exclaimed, surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana gave a slightly embarrassed smile. "Sorry, I'm just here to watch the show."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula couldn't help but smile back, the corners of her lips curling up in amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, even though I couldn't help you get revenge, I think their lives are already a kind of hell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded her expression one of quiet satisfaction. "Yeah, seeing them like this feels good. Mr. Jeff Marsh and Queenie used to conspire against me, so I guess this is my payback."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Diana's words, Jeff's eyes turned cold, his fury building. "Diana, it's all because of you. If you hadn't come back, how could our family have ended up like this? It's because of you that I've lost everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was shaking with rage, his anger like a violent storm tearing through him, his eyes wide and bloodshot. He blamed Diana for everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Diana had woken up at Queenie's party, everything had changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had become easier to control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Jeff had been outmaneuvered by Paula without even realizing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana could see the fury building up in him, and she knew he was on the edge of losing control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled and said, "Mr. Jeff Marsh, it's not that I'm kicking you when you're down. Don't forget, you were the one who brought me back. You sent me to the countryside, and when you needed me, you called me back. How is that suddenly my fault?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused, her gaze sharp. "Do you remember your purpose when you brought me back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a man obsessed with other people's wealth, a puppet trying to take shortcuts, and now, somehow, he dared to place all the blame on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff's thoughts suddenly shifted, and he recalled something bothering him. "Wait a minute. I only brought you back because Sir Gellar and Madam Gellar approached me first. They told me Queenie wasn't a Marsh by blood, and that Steven was supposed to marry the real daughter of the Marsh family. But I had no idea why those two old fools knew the truth. So, I had no choice but to bring you back, because they got their hands on the paternity test results for Queenie and Paula, proving they weren't related. If it hadn't been for that test, I would never have called you back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Diana felt like she'd finally stumbled upon the right path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she hadn't come, she would have never known the full story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did Helen and Edward know Queenie and Paula weren't mother and daughter?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was confused. "How did they know about this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff had no idea how Helen and Edward had learned about this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only after spending so much time drinking and dining with Steven that he accidentally let this information slip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, I remember now. After attending a party at the Gellars' house one night, I got pretty drunk. The next day, Sir Gellar came to see me and made this request. I didn't have a choice, so I brought you back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused, adding, "At the time, I didn't think much of it, but now that I look back, it's strange. After I helped you get back and you and Steven got your marriage certificate, Sir Gellar went abroad and never returned."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana narrowed her eyes with suspicion. "What was the real story behind all this?" she thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd always felt that Leopold was hiding something from her. But what could it be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she thought about Leopold's recent actions, everything seemed normal. He hadn't shown any signs of suspicion or odd behavior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The storm this year had been particularly bad, and Leopold had been stuck abroad, spending Christmas with Edward. That wasn't unusual at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leopold had looked into the Gellars when he found out she was going to marry Steven, so it wasn't surprising that the two old men knew each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Diana felt overwhelmed. Why did she feel like she was just another piece on someone else's chessboard?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1009.html">« Prev</a><a href="1011.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
