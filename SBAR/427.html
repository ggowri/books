Not all sincere efforts can be rewarded. Zora has worked for me for many years. I did her a lot of good so she could send her two children to college. If she went to some other family as a caregiver, she could not get such a high salary. I felt sorry for the couple having to raise two children, so I helped them whenever I can.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Her husband is a driver for another company. She works for me and I have never treated her unfairly. When she had difficulties, I took the initiative to help her with money. What do you think I got in return?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie did this just to get Steven, but I won't let her get her way as long as I'm alive."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mrs. Helen Gellar couldn't move, and she was excited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since Zora was ungrateful, there was no need for her to be merciful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked at Diana and felt sorry for her. "Diana, that's why I agreed to your divorce from Steven. He doesn't know love, and he can't learn to love someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In his world, he thinks that liking someone means giving her all the good things, but love is not like that. Love is about making each other happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've been married to your grandfather for so many years, and I've never expected love from him. He's a playboy, but those women of his have never come to me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The son he raised was even more dissolute than him, causing Steven's mother to suffer all her life. Whenever I think of these things, my heart aches. However, one person's power is limited. We can't change others, so we can only make ourselves happier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Silly girl, I just want you to be happier."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mrs. Helen Gellar spoke in a choked voice, and Diana's eyes turned red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grandma, I'll live a good life in the future. I've done what I should do. I don't owe Steven anything anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I told you about this so that you would be on guard against Queenie. You're the biggest obstacle to her marrying Steven. I'm afraid..." said Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I know. Leave the dirty work to me. I've been through this before and I understand what you mean. Just focus on your career."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mrs. Helen Gellar's eyes glinted angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She, too, fought her way out of all kinds of plots.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some people and some things needed to be dealt with slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Half an hour later, Diana withdrew the needles, and Mrs. Helen Gellar fell asleep peacefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana stayed there watching over her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After hearing what Zora said last night, Diana was worried about Mrs. Helen Gellar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana took out her phone and saw the message Joseph sent her last night. She finally knew why Steven would suddenly get angry. It was because he saw the message Joseph sent her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana lowered her head to text. [Joseph, I was in the middle of something last night and didn't check my phone. I'm fine. Don't worry about me.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph replied almost immediately. [Diana, I'm relieved that you're safe. Grandma is recovering well.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled and sent a message to Olivia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Olivia, are you doing well abroad?]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Olivia replied after a long while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Diana, I'm good. You don't have to worry about me. I've been busy making money recently. I'll take you on a lavish trip when I come back.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled and replied: [Okay!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then she lowered her head to check her company's financial statements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After she worked with Alexander, her company's performance was booming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana couldn't stop smiling when she saw the performance increase of 10% over last month.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The live streaming platform of Alexander's company would become more and more popular in the future, so she must seize the opportunity to cooperate with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was thinking about it when she received a message from Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Diana, have you seen this month's financial statements? Thank you for helping my company make a fortune. Are you free tonight? Let's have dinner together.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana replied: [Okay, Alexander, please send me the address and I'll see you in the evening.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander replied: [Okay. I'll send you the address later.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana couldn't suppress the smile on her lips. That was really, really great.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After she left Steven, her company was thriving. How could love be as happy as making money?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Half an hour later, Mrs. Helen Gellar woke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She sat up slowly, looked at Diana, and smiled lovingly. "Diana, I feel much better, and my stomach doesn't hurt anymore. Can you stay with me tonight?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="426.html">« Prev</a><a href="428.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
