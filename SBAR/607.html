You... Why do you keep harping on this matter? It was just a man's bit of fun..." Jeff tried to argue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So now you're a family? I've always wanted to ask you why Queenie stayed with you after you divorced. What exactly is your relationship with her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at Jeff coldly, deliberately emphasizing the word "relationship."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff looked at her guiltily, instinctively raising his hand to cover his mouth and cough softly, his gaze shifting. "Don't meddle in my affairs. I came to you today to discuss money matters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's tone was pressuring. "When I left you, I gave you 100,000 dollars. I owe you nothing. How dare you come to me for money?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, he and Queenie wanted to force Diana to leave because once Steven had recovered his health, Diana had lost her use value.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!" Jeff snorted coldly, his gaze malicious. "Diana, no matter when, you are my daughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So the parent-child relationship termination document you forced me to sign was just for fun? Because I have no use value, you thought of this way to drive me away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't need me to contain Steven. Moreover, once Queenie comes back, I will lose my use value. I'm curious that she's not your biological daughter, but you've risked your life to protect Queenie. What exactly is your relationship with her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff had never thought about this question, and faced with Diana's questioning, his eyes dodged, and his face turned red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, don't be silly. She is my adopted daughter. She is my daughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? You treat a woman without blood relations as your daughter and even live with her and your mistress. When you divorced, you abandoned your four sons and me, as if we five siblings were a burden you were eager to get rid of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Jeff Marsh, no matter how I think, something seems wrong with your actions. Did you lie to Ms. Barnes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's gaze was cold and sharp, looking at him coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That gaze had no warmth or emotion as if it could instantly freeze Jeff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff shuddered, feeling the air around him congeal, thinking, "How can this little girl have such a cold and powerful aura?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Little girl, stop talking nonsense. How could I lie to your mother? She and I are at this age. We can't afford turmoil. She owes so much debt. Can't I divorce her? People are selfish."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right. People are selfish. So it's only right for me to live well for myself, not giving you money, isn't it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can abandon your wife and children. Can't I abandon my own father and relatives? I'm just following your example."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana laughed brilliantly, her tone sarcastic. "If possible, I really don't want to have your selfish bloodline."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out!" Diana stood up, glaring at him. "Jeff, from the day I cut ties with you, from the day you had an affair and conspired with Queenie against me, to the day you directed the abduction drama, our father-daughter relationship was over. As for giving you money, that's impossible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff heard that he wouldn't get any benefits and roared angrily. "But I am your father! Now that I'm down and out, it's your responsibility to take care of me. Give me a sum of money to buy out my relationship with you."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="606.html">« Prev</a><a href="608.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
