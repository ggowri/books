She had already received the address he had sent her. The restaurant was near the villa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She just remembered going to the movies alone in her previous life. The latest movie that was released was not bad. It was called "The Bitter Bind".</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It told a love-and-hate story. She saw the trailer while browsing her phone. She was a big fan of the starring actor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was planning to invest in film and television next, but today she just wanted to watch a movie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What she didn't know was that Steven was following behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He followed her closely for fear that she would see Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So he saw her pull into the parking lot below a mall. Then she went to a fruit shop and bought a box of peeled fruit before taking the elevator directly to the sixth floor of the mall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He followed her all the way to the sixth floor. She first bought popcorn and a large cup of Coke, then bought a ticket for "The Bitter Bind" and went straight to the cinema.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The movie was about to start in a few minutes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven had watched movies with Queenie there. He bought a ticket with ease and followed Diana in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The lights in the cinema were dim and there were many people during the daytime. Diana sat in the second to last row. The last row had some empty seats, so Steven sat behind Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana put everything aside, and there was a special place for Coke next to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven saw her drink iced Coke and frowned slightly. Girls should have less cold drinks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie would have cramps when she had her period. He realized then that women couldn't eat too much cold food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he never paid attention to Diana. He didn't know if she would also have cramps during her period.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He realized that he had really neglected Diana completely. No wonder she hated him so much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana picked up a piece of popcorn and ate it. The milky flavor made her squint her eyes in enjoyment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her long eyelashes trembled as she picked up the Coke and took another sip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Feels great!" she exclaimed inside her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The movie started, and she watched it quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The opening was sad because the heroine was framed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Micah Allen looked at his master coldly, his eyes full of disgust. "Master, you saved me and took care of me just to take my blood to suppress the evil nature inside you. And you're gonna kill me when I'm no use to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The actor who played Micah had amazing acting skills. The thing Diana liked most about him was that he looked so handsome and yet so miserable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The actor seemed to be from Steven's entertainment company, and Steven seemed to have invested in the movie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana knew that Steven was going to make a fortune again. She was reborn at the wrong time and did not have time to invest in it, but she knew about other movies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For example, the movie starred by Queenie and Levi would not even have a chance to be aired.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While Mrs. Helen Gellar was asleep, Diana browsed her phone and suddenly remembered the ending of Levi in her previous life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tsk, a good show will be ready soon," Diana thought.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="428.html">« Prev</a><a href="430.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
