If you do this, I will marry Queenie."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew was stunned for a long time before he realized what Steven said. He shouted excitedly, "Steven, you bastard! How dare you say such a thing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven smiled meaningfully and looked at the angry Andrew calmly, thinking, "Why does he get angry now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew only had murderous intentions towards Steven, and Steven only had hatred towards Andrew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Queenie's excitement completely disappeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven, what do you mean?" She looked at Steven with red eyes and grievance. It seemed that she couldn't marry him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven looked at her indifferently. "Ms. Marsh, do you remember what I told you? My grandfather will never let you marry me. Even if I divorce Diana, the person I want to marry will not be you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since it is a marriage arranged by my family, then it must be worthwhile."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven stood up and left. His cold voice made Queenie feel chilled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She and the Marsh family had no value, so Steven looked down on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had always known that, but she was unwilling to accept it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's eyes turned red with anger. Back then, it was the two old guys in the Farley family who didn't let her marry Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was so angry that she made up an excuse to go abroad, just to make Steven feel guilty. Steven did feel guilty, but he was no longer as good to her as before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Andrew Gellar, what should we do now? Steven..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What should we do? You are a loser. I used a trick to make Steven think you saved him so that he loved you deeply. As long as he married you, many things would be solved. But what stupid things did you do?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You can't even defeat a woman like Diana. Since she is blocking your way, there are many ways to get rid of her. Don't let her grow stronger, or it will be more difficult to deal with her in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie lowered her head and said apologetically, "I'm sorry. Diana suddenly became very powerful. I don't know what happened."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana is a girl from the countryside. Is she powerful? I don't care what method you use, but you must find a way to marry Steven so that our plan can be completed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew stood up and walked out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana, who had just returned from the bathroom, happened to hear their conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing the footsteps, she quickly turned around and left, hiding behind the other end of the passage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's face was gloomy. She knew that Andrew didn't like Steven, and he disliked her even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But why did Andrew cooperate with Queenie to deal with her together?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He also made Steven think it was Queenie who saved him back then. What was their plan?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why did Queenie have to marry Steven?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was not surprising at all that Andrew wanted to kill his own son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew had always been vicious. He had many lovers and illegitimate children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Diana thought of something.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="353.html">« Prev</a><a href="355.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
