"Mr. Gellar, you're divorced. Why are you still checking on Mrs. Gellar?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven shot Evan a cold glance. "Just do as I say."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing he had overstepped, Evan replied respectfully, "Understood, Mr. Gellar. I'll look into it tomorrow."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven closed his eyes, his anger only growing as he recalled Luna's words. She had said that Diana was too good for him, implying he was unworthy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling frustrated, he tried to rest. Despite everything, he realized he hardly knew Diana. She had been a means to an end, a step towards gaining control of the business. Yet, he couldn't ignore how kind she had been to him. The more he thought about it, the more confused he became.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Diana leaned against the car window, watching the flickering scenery outside. She warned Luna, "Stay away from Steven. I might have shown too much tonight, and he could suspect my identity. We can't let him find out who I really am."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Jeff well enough to predict that if he discovered she was connected to the powerful Azure Group, he would try to take it from her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna nodded with determination. "Don't worry, Ms. Bishop. He won't find out."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was always relieved, knowing she could trust Luna and Nolan to handle things.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they arrived home, Leopold was already asleep, so Diana quietly headed upstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you're back," Olivia said, her voice muffled by a facial mask.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded, "Yes."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling exhausted, she just wanted a shower and to head to bed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia noticed her fatigue and smiled, "Did you have a good night?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought about meeting Mr. James and replied, "If you say I was lucky, then I guess I was."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! You look tired. Get some rest, and we can talk tomorrow," Olivia said as she returned to her room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled at her and went to bed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Queenie was far from calm. Seeing Diana shine tonight had unnerved her. She rushed home to tell her parents that Diana had stolen her spotlight, conveniently leaving out Diana's knowledge of the Avernia language.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, Dad, Diana made a spectacle of herself tonight. She's definitely trying to win Steven back."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt overwhelmed. Diana was more beautiful and talented than ever, heightening her sense of insecurity. She also feared Cecil's revenge; the man was known for holding grudges.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff and Paula were upset too. Paula, seeing Queenie's distress&mdash;her beloved daughter since childhood&mdash;tried to comfort her. "Queenie, don't worry. Diana's just trying to show off. She can't compete with you. I'll speak to her tomorrow and make it clear that she needs to step aside."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff and Queenie exchanged relieved glances.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie hugged Paula, feigning concern. "Mom, you don't have to do that. Diana is your daughter. Don't let me ruin your relationship with her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inwardly, she scoffed at the notion of any real bond between them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula, deeply influenced by Queenie and Jeff, trusted Queenie over Diana. Everything from the Barnes family and even Steven seemed destined for Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Queenie so understanding, Paula felt helpless. Diana's sharpness was baffling to her. She planned to confront Diana the next day, to see how she was doing and to insist she stop antagonizing Queenie.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="45.html">« Prev</a><a href="47.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
