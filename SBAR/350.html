"Diana, I'm saying this for your own good. You haven't even graduated from high school. The works you design will only be questioned by others. Then you and us will be embarrassed."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana felt that her patience had reached its limit. "Frank, since you dote on Queenie so much, wait until the day of your wedding to see who arranged Elsie for you.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Also, I'm a designer and am graduated from the top design school abroad. When I graduated, you were still working hard to take the SAT. How could a bastard like you know how to write the word genius?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Diana hung up the phone and blocked Frank's number.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She never wanted to hear that bastard's voice again. It was so dreadful.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey! Diana, what do you mean? Explain it!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was no response on the phone. Frank lowered his head and found that the call had been hung up. He was so angry that his face turned gloomy. He thought, "Diana hung up on me once again."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He then called Diana several times and found that he had been blocked.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, you must be jealous of my doting on Queenie. That's why you said that."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank didn't believe Diana's words at all.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "I treat Queenie very well. How could Queenie plot against me?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank sneered, took a taxi on the roadside, and left to socialize.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Diana hung up the phone, she was still outraged.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Diana comforted herself that it was not worth it to ruin her health. She took a deep breath and looked at the scenery outside the window. Her mood was still depressed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil invited her to have dinner at Colorful Restaurant.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Diana arrived, Cecil said that he was in the underground parking lot.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He asked her to go to the parking lot to find him. From the parking lot, they could take the special elevator directly to the top floor. Diana thought it was convenient, so she went directly to the underground first floor.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana then went to the parking lot.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil had already arrived, standing by the car waiting for her. His casual and uninhibited aura made him look charming.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Diana could say anything, she saw a young couple not far away hugging and kissing each other madly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh... Elsie, I miss you so much... Your little mouth is so sweet. I want to go deeper. So comfortable..." said Zorro Cole.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana and Cecil were both shocked.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Neither of them had ever experienced sex.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Diana had experienced it in her previous life. Steven had been drugged. By accident, she had become the antidote and then pregnant.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But that time, she had just felt pain.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven had never been gentle to Diana.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, she had a chance to start over. She would not make herself a fool again.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil's face turned red, and he leaned tightly against Diana.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two crouched to reduce their presence for fear of disturbing the two people opposite them.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Zorro, you said you would love me forever. I'm getting married soon. After I get married and get the money, let's leave here. Frank is an idiot. He is nothing except having some money."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was shocked. She thought, "It is Elsie, Frank's girlfriend!"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="349.html">« Prev</a><a href="351.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
