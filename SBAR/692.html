Diana was most likely framed. Queenie wanted to clear her name. Amelie and Mark wanted revenge. So, they framed Diana with that excuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Regardless of whether Diana killed Lily or not, this kind of public opinion can clear Queenie's name. It is their purpose. They want Queenie to be clean, so they frame Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Behind Diana is the Farley family. They are all powerful families in Capitole. We can't deal with the rest. Send Jasmine to the hospital first."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad carried Jasmine on his back and called his son, asking him to drive over and take Jasmine to the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It only took several hours for the Staggs family to be destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven did not acquire the Staggs family's company. Moira went to find Steven and calmed him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Cecil had already taken action.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Staggs family was broken. But they learned a lesson. Their company was already in a precarious situation, and Cecil's actions actually helped the Staggs family. The previously precarious company was bought by someone else, and it filled the gap in their company.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes, a crisis was also an opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moira personally recorded a video to apologize to Diana, saying, "Ms. Bishop, I'm sorry. My daughter, Jasmine, was ignorant and said some unpleasant things to you under the deliberate guidance of Queenie. I am deeply sorry for this. The conflict between you and Queenie was all told to Jasmine by Queenie."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a simple apology, but Queenie was exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moira, of course, would not let Queenie, who had plotted against Jasmine, go.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the words "deliberate guidance", Queenie couldn't clarify herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie thought that she had stabilized the situation and could clear herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Moira's video made netizens' attitudes change, and they all started scolding Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie called Jasmine again, but Jasmine's phone number was no longer in service.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smashed her phone angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were full of gloom. Queenie thought, "That idiot actually asks her mother to clarify the matter online and then disappears."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie clenched her teeth, and the muscles on her face twitched slightly with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Moira is really a bitch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie cursed Moira fiercely in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She unconsciously clenched her hands into fists, her nails digging deeply into her palms. But she didn't feel any pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, all kinds of chaotic thoughts kept flashing through her mind. Anger was burning in her heart as if it was going to devour her sanity completely. She thought, "I have finally cleared myself. But if Moira intervenes in this matter, the situation will only get worse."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's eyes grew colder and colder, like a bottomless pool in the chilly night.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had pretended to be pitiful and weak to gain sympathy. She finally made Steven obey her in everything. But now...</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie stood up, walked to the window, and looked at the snow-covered city outside. This winter seemed particularly long.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stretched out her hand, trying to catch a gust of winter breeze. But she couldn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just like she could never capture that man's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had tears in her eyes and stroked her belly. Levi had been avoiding her and was unwilling to acknowledge this child.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the relationship between the two could not be torn apart now.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie looked at her haggard face reflected in the window. She had really ruined her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she smiled coldly. She thought, "Anyway, Diana and Steven will never be together."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="691.html">« Prev</a><a href="693.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
