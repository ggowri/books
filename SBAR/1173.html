"Sir, don't worry. She can't run far. With her personality, she won't survive out there. All her companies are finished."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mario was her right-hand man. Once Mario went down, the whole company fell apart. Tax evasion, illegal operations&mdash;when the authorities investigate, plus with Jingchuan's technical support, just the criminal records from their company alone would keep Queenie locked up for life. Most employees have fled. Now it's just an empty shell."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The company's been deserted for a while, but we've kept it under wraps to prevent word from getting out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie doesn't have much money left either. She's completely broke now." Evan's biggest worry was that Queenie might go after his wife.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven nodded. "Keep searching. Find her as soon as possible and send her straight to the police."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With nothing left to lose, Queenie would only become more desperate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna said, "She's hiding deep. We still can't track her down."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan looked at Luna. "Diana, leave this to me. You're pregnant now&mdash;you need to rest."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?" Diana looked at Luna in surprise, then at Evan. Right, these two had gotten their marriage license. It wasn't strange for Evan to call her Diana, but she still needed time to adjust. The little girl she'd grown up with was all grown up now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna smiled shyly. "Sis, I'm pregnant too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's surprise melted into a smile. "That's wonderful! You two are married now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana grinned mysteriously. "Luna, perfect timing&mdash;we can go through pregnancy together. Let Aiden and Iris come back. You should rest well for the next couple of years."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna beamed with happiness. "Sis, Aiden and Iris are already back. Nolan's got them working on the hot springs resort project. It's going really well."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was thrilled. Ever since learning about her pregnancy, her mood had been soaring daily. "That's fantastic! We can spend the next three years focusing on raising our kids."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna nodded happily. "Sounds perfect, sis."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven and Evan headed back to rest with their wives. Diana started up the stairs, exhaustion hitting her. "Steven, I'm going to bed first. You can tidy up later&mdash;I'm beat."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven quickly followed, supporting her as they climbed. Diana glanced at him sideways, and before she could speak, Steven said, "You're in the danger period right now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana fell silent. These past few days, Steven had been more anxious than she was, and she was the pregnant one. "If you're tired, we can deal with those things tomorrow. Grandpa and Grandma sent lots of fruits, but I can't have too much rich food right now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven gazed at her gentle features. Life had been truly blissful lately. "Alright. I want to rest with you. Once we get through these first three months, you'll feel better."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at him with amusement. "Do you spend every day glued to your phone researching this stuff?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven answered honestly, "Yeah, but I'm not just looking things up online. I've been talking to doctors&mdash;when you'll start with morning sickness, when it'll stop, when your appetite will improve."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Listening to his tender voice, Diana smiled. She was surrounded by such happiness now that sometimes it felt overwhelming. "Honey, this happiness feels almost too good to be true."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana turned to look at him. Steven froze slightly at her calling him "honey," joy flooding through him. He felt the same way&mdash;unreal, yet living in bliss every day. "Me too, Diana." He squeezed her hand, his voice growing even softer. "Diana, you're finally willing to call me honey."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was over the moon, grinning from ear to ear. Seeing his smile, Diana couldn't help but smile too. "Am I not allowed to?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said quietly, "I hope you'll call me honey every day."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana laughed. When they reached the second floor, she stood on her tiptoes and kissed his cheek. Steven's breath caught, and he kissed her back passionately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven held her waist tight. With her being pregnant now, they couldn't do much of anything. Diana hadn't expected him to suddenly get like this. Her eyes went wide as she wrapped her arms around Steven. His kiss was way too intense, practically suffocating her. "Mmm&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana squirmed a few times before Steven finally let her go. Diana was gasping, totally pissed off. "I couldn't even breathe."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven scooped her up in his arms. "Diana, let's head back to the bedroom and pick up where we left off."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shot him a look. "Pick up what? I'm pregnant now. You seriously still want to keep going?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stared at her pouty red lips&mdash;so damn cute. "Diana, how can you be this adorable?" He pressed a soft kiss to her forehead. Diana didn't say anything, just melted into his arms. Thinking about Queenie, she asked, "Where do you think Queenie's hiding out?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven set her down on the bed. "Don't worry about it. Evan's on it. Dealing with her myself just makes me want to puke."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana figured he was right. Having Evan handle it was way better&mdash;she didn't want to see Queenie's face either. Just looking at that woman made her sick. "Alright! I'm gonna go wash up. I'm beat."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven saw her eyes barely staying open and smiled, carrying her to the bathroom to get cleaned up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That night was totally peaceful. Diana had been sleeping like a rock lately. Steven was starting to worry&mdash;this much sleep couldn't be normal. He was thinking about having a doctor check her out. Diana was already a sleepyhead, and being pregnant just made it ten times worse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was already noon when Diana finally woke up. The phone ringing had jolted her awake. She cracked her eyes open, her whole body feeling sore and drained, lazily reaching for her phone. "Hello?" Her voice was still all groggy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie's nasty voice came through the speaker. "Diana, if you want to save your mother and two brothers, get your ass to the address I'm about to send you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shot awake. Save who? What mother? What brothers? She'd cut those people off ages ago. "Queenie, what the hell are you talking about? Don't you know I cut all ties with them?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie's voice was ice cold. "Diana, I know you're just being stubborn. You say you don't want them, but deep down you still give a damn."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your mother's so pretty. If I shove her off, she'll definitely shatter into a million pieces, completely torn apart." Queenie's voice was pure evil.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana hesitated for a second. "Queenie, where exactly are you? You can't run forever. Turn yourself in&mdash;you might get to see a few more Christmases."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was losing it. "Diana, I'm not turning myself in. There's no way in hell I'm losing to you. In my past life at this point, I was already a business queen. I won't lose. You've got one hour. If you don't show up, I'll kill them just to drag you down with me."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1172.html">« Prev</a><a href="1174.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
