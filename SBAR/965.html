His eyes were filled with contempt and ill intent.</p><p>&quot;If you don&#x27;t explain clearly, I won&#x27;t go with you,&quot; she said firmly, stepping back a few paces.</p><p>It was Christmas, and if she ran into danger, only the police could help. But by the time they arrived, it might be too late.</p><p>She remained vigilant, eyeing the two men warily.</p><p>The fat man, out of patience, barked, &quot;If you want your son to live, you&#x27;ll come with us. He owes 30 million dollars at the casino and can&#x27;t pay. He said you could pay off his debt. Our boss saw your picture and said you have some charm. Come with us, earn the money, and you can go.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What?&quot; Amelie was shocked.</p><p>She couldn&#x27;t believe her son, whom she had spoiled since childhood, would do this.</p><p>It was Christmas, and her son hadn&#x27;t come home.</p><p>She thought he was out having fun, trying to clear his head after losing the company.</p><p>She never imagined he would gamble and lose 30 million dollars.</p><p>She didn&#x27;t even have three million dollars now, and the house wasn&#x27;t worth much either.</p><p>The worst part was learning that her son&#x27;s overseas branch was ruined by Paula&#x27;s scheming.</p><p>Outside, it was freezing. The fat man, shirtless, shivered with the cold, his muscles twitching under the icy air.</p><p>He snapped, &quot;Why so many questions? Hurry up and come with us. Our boss said once you pay off the debt, you can go. Your son&#x27;s life depends on it.</p><p>&quot;If you delay any longer, he is dead.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No!&quot; Amelie screamed in fear, stepping back quickly. &quot;No, I&#x27;m not going. Go find his father. His father is wealthy. He&#x27;ll pay you.&quot;</p><p>Mark would help his son.</p><p>She realized then why Lily had returned alive and hadn&#x27;t accused Mark of trying to kill her.</p><p>Paula and Lily had been waiting for this moment.</p><p>It was all part of their plan to destroy them.</p><p>She had spent her life as a mistress, enjoying wealth without effort.</p><p>She didn&#x27;t understand business and was no match for Paula.</p><p>Paula had set them up to fall from great heights, ensuring their downfall was as painful as possible.</p><p>Tears streamed down Amelie&#x27;s face. She was helpless and hopeless.</p><p>This might be karma for her years of taking what didn&#x27;t belong to her.</p><p>People tended to believe in fate when there were no solutions.</p><p>The fat man laughed coldly, &quot;We know about Mark. He&#x27;s so broke he can&#x27;t afford dinner and is now kneeling at his ex-wife&#x27;s door, begging. In this cold, he might be tomorrow&#x27;s headline—a dead scumbag.&quot;</p><p>Amelie was incredulous.</p><p>This couldn&#x27;t be true.</p><p>She covered her face, shaking her head. &quot;No. I was supposed to be the richest. How did it all come to this? This isn&#x27;t the ending I wanted.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Stop crying. Let&#x27;s go.&quot; The fat man grabbed her arm, but she quickly pulled away, terrified.</p><p>She shouted, &quot;Don&#x27;t touch me. My daughter has money. I&#x27;ll call her to save her brother.&quot;</p><p>The fat man, shivering, pushed her towards the house. &quot;Fine, call her inside. It&#x27;s too cold out here. If she pays up, we&#x27;ll leave without any trouble.&quot;</p><p>Once inside, the warmth eased their discomfort.</p><p>The fat man shrugged, while the other man scolded him, &quot;Told you to dress warmer. Now you&#x27;re freezing. Serves you right.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I thought we&#x27;d be quick. Not cold anymore.&quot; He looked at Amelie and shouted, &quot;What are you waiting for? Call your daughter and get the money. It&#x27;s Christmas, and I want to go home to my wife.&quot;</p><p>Amelie was furious.</p><p>She gritted her teeth, picked up her phone, and called Queenie.</p><p>&quot;Hello, Mom.&quot; Queenie was in the hospital, watching over George, who hadn&#x27;t woken up yet. She was already in a foul mood.</p><p>She had planned a wonderful evening with him, but now...</p><p>Queenie closed her eyes, frustration mounting.</p><p>Then Amelie&#x27;s tearful voice came through the phone. &quot;Queenie, help. Your brother lost 30 million dollars at the casino, and the debt collectors are at our house. If we don&#x27;t pay, they&#x27;ll kill him.</p><p>&quot;Queenie, he&#x27;s your only brother. You have to save him.</p><p>&quot;I know it&#x27;s easy for you to come up with 30 million dollars. Once this matter is over, I&#x27;ll have your brother work for you and pay off the debt. Is it okay?&quot;</p><p>The news irritated Queenie even further.</p><p>She was so angry that her head felt like it was about to explode.</p><p>Ever since falling out with Paula&#x27;s family, she hadn&#x27;t had a peaceful day.</p><p>Amelie only brought her trouble and couldn&#x27;t help her with anything.</p><p>&quot;Mom, that&#x27;s 30 million dollars, not 300 dollars. You know I&#x27;m struggling too,&quot; Queenie yelled, her head pounding.</p><p>Amelie pleaded, &quot;Queenie, I know it&#x27;s tough, but with George&#x27;s help, you can save your brother. We&#x27;re family. Please, Queenie, I&#x27;m begging you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Can you stop bothering me?&quot; Queenie snapped, exasperated. &quot;I&#x27;m already stressed. Why do you keep dragging me down?</p><p>&quot;Mom, are you trying to drive me to death?&quot;</p><p>She was frustrated. It seemed like she had reached a dead end. Even though George had returned, he still hadn&#x27;t allowed her to live the life she desired.</p><p>Amelie&#x27;s sobs continued. &quot;Queenie, it&#x27;s just 30 million dollars. If your brother is dead, who will be there for you? Please, help him.&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="964.html">« Prev</a><a href="966.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
