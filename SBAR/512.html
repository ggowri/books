But his eyes were full of calculation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, do you know? My father almost died abroad. His overseas business was taken away by someone for no reason. When I went to Woodston, I was framed, and my project was taken away. If you hadn't prepared in advance, I would be in jail now. The bad guys are really bad. They made me grow up quickly in a few months.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When their first plan fails, they would come up with another one. We can't let them go on like this. We have to turn the passive situation into the active one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was worried about what would happen the day after tomorrow and wondered if he would be able to deal with it. "The most important thing right now is what will happen the day after tomorrow. I wonder who will report the Farley family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will go find Wyatt and release Samuel in three days. Find someone to follow him. He won't behave himself. If it's not Wyatt, someone else will report you. I will let Luna investigate. You should secretly arrange someone to investigate the person you suspect. So, arrange the auction at tomorrow and let Queenie buy the land first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as the Farley family did not fall, Queenie would be anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If you wanted to be the biggest winner, you had to avoid the enemy's sharp edge and take them by surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil understood what Diana meant. If it were arranged for three days later, and if the Farley family were being reported that the building materials did not meet the regulations, the Farley family's stock price would fall. Then, the price of that land would continue to be suppressed and would be worthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I'll arrange the auction."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil looked at Diana's clear eyes. They were calm but made him feel at ease. With Diana around, Cecil really felt at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded slightly and said with a smile, "Okay! When you finish this matter, I will tell you a good news. Then, we can make money together. Bring Alexander with us. Alexander is mature and steady. It will be right to cooperate with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil laughed and said, "That's great, Diana. I'm really lucky to have met you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were red. Cecil had been feeling as miserable as a roller coaster in recent times. He had enjoyed a life of luxury from childhood. He had everything he wanted and never thought that someone would like to take away their property.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at his red eyes, Diana pressed her lips slightly. She thought, "The future is still unknown. But as long as I love myself well, no one can hurt me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana lowered her head and ate some salad. It was crispy and delicious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil watched her finish eating before letting her called Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana did not call Queenie directly but sent a message to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Queenie, I'm late. Cecil got the news that the land in the western suburbs has been planned into several blocks. Its value has increased instantly. He is unwilling to sell it to you at a low price. There will be an auction tomorrow. If you want to buy it, go and bid. Many people want it.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie saw the message from Diana and sneered angrily. She thought, "I thought Diana was important in Cecil's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Cecil is even unwilling to give Diana this favor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie quickly called Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew Queenie would call and mock her. So, she answered the phone and turned on the speakerphone, allowing Cecil to hear what Queenie would say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I thought you had a good relationship with Mr. Farley. But he is even unwilling to give you a favor for such a small matter. I really overestimated you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you hadn't ruined my things last time, Cecil, that idiot, would have been helping me all along. It wouldn't have been your turn, Diana."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="511.html">« Prev</a><a href="513.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
