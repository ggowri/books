Queenie is truly exceptional..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven shot him an icy glare, and Yanson quickly shut his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Steven leave with Evan.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan walked up to Yanson and patted his shoulder. "Yanson, you've got a real trash mouth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Yanson was stunned. She glared at Evan. "Evan, are you out of your mind? What are you so angry about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're the one who's out of your mind! Seriously messed up! What's it to you if someone else is a hick? And you call yourself a playboy? Take a look at all the women you've hurt. Instead of meddling in other people's relationships, why don't you go and sweet-talk your current girlfriend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey... what's gotten into you, dude?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson was irritated. This punk had changed so much in such a short time that he barely recognized him anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen casually crossed his legs and whispered, "Alright, just let it go. Nobody can say a bad word about Diana now. If they do, he'll definitely bite back."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson's interest was piqued as he looked at Owen, feeling fired up. "Owen, you've been back for a few months now. Seems like I missed a lot while I was gone. What's the scoop?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen shook his head with a lazy smile, leaning back. "Let's not get involved in other people's drama. Let's just drink."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson furrowed his brows, looking at the trending topics on his phone. "Is Queenie really pregnant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen shook his head. "No idea."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He usually loved gossip, but this piece of news was a bit too hot to handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson shot him a cold glance. "Fine, don't tell me. I'll find the answers myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven went straight to the parking lot with Evan, his mood at rock bottom.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, whenever he went out for business dinners, Diana would call to remind him not to drink too much and to come home early. She'd always have a pot of herbal soup waiting for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it had been almost a year since Diana left, and now, when he went out in the evenings, no one called to check on him anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep breath and leaned back in his seat. "Let's go home."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan glanced at him through the rearview mirror but stayed quiet as he drove.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forty minutes later, they arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven stared at the dark mansion, his eyes filled with melancholy.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He told Evan, "You can head home now."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan had never seen Steven this down before, but he kept quiet, knowing what was going through his boss' mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was lonely now. Back when Diana loved him, she would've been waiting up at this hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would've had hot herbal soup ready for him, but now the mansion was pitch black, making Steven feel even more empty inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan understood Steven's sadness and decided to twist the knife with a grin. "Oh! Ms. Bishop must be asleep by now. Back then, whenever I'd drop you off, she'd always make me a bowl of her special health soup. I slept like a baby after drinking that."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he dashed off.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven rolled his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Evan was doing this on purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After watching Evan leave, he took a deep breath and walked toward the mansion's entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he'd already given up hope, disappointment still hit him when he pushed open the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The living room was dark and empty - no Diana, not even a light left on for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He went straight upstairs to the dressing room to change.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Passing by the laundry area, he noticed his pile of dirty clothes had vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking up, he found them all neatly hung in the closet.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart, heavy with sadness just moments ago, suddenly flooded with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gazing out the window, he remembered Diana pushing him through the snowy grounds for a walk. The snowy scene that night had been picture-perfect.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The smile in her eyes had been so genuine, so full of love!</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smiling to himself, he changed and headed for the bathroom to shower.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After drying his hair, he walked without hesitation to Diana's room next door.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="726.html">« Prev</a><a href="728.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
