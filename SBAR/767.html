Looking at the weak Queenie, he felt distressed and shook his head. "Ms. Marsh, he didn't want to come here. He asked me to go find a doctor. He sounded very angry. Mr. Gellar should be in a bad mood now."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was disappointed, and her expression became uglier as she heard Mario making excuses for Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this was what she had expected because she had realized that Steven didn't care about her now.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were gains and losses in one's life, but she never expected that Steven's favor would disappear so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was her greatest support, and now he was one of the richest people. If she could marry him, she would live a carefree life.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, you finally let me down," Queenie cried. Why did she end up like this? She defeated Paula and Diana, but she lost Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was the only person who was truly kind to her over the years and her only powerful supporter.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man she loved had never been so kind to her. She knew clearly that he was only using her, but she was still willing to devote herself. When she was sad, that man was never by her side to accompany her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie showed determination on her face. She looked at Mario and said, "Get ready. Next time when we meet Steven, we must let a hypnotist hypnotize him and make him obey us. All the money I earned in the past few years has been lost in Paula's company. I was too careless."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about this matter, Queenie was so angry that her whole body was shaking. She thought she had won, but it was something Paula didn't want.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula's company was in debt. Queenie planned to acquire the company as long as Paula paid back the money. In that way, she would own the technology and partners, and the company would revive within two years and make more money.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had calculated everything, but she didn't expect those technicians to suddenly run away and those partners to terminate the contract.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Mario. "Mario, go find some technicians. Our company has other partners. We must save the company and not let Paula look down on us. Since I got her company, I must do better than her and make her admire me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario nodded. "Okay, Ms. Marsh. I will arrange this. You should have a good rest and take care of your body first."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well. Go ahead." Queenie lay on the hospital bed with a sick look. She was looking at her cell phone, but there were no messages. She thought, "Steven, are you unwilling to take care of me anymore?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie closed her eyes in pain. How could she be so unlucky? After Diana came back, everything went wrong for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought it was all Jeff's fault. Why didn't he kill Diana back then?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was fine he dumped Diana, but why...</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie thought about the reason why Diana was found. If she hadn't disliked Steven for being blind, Diana would never have had the chance to marry Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was all Jeff's fault. He was too greedy and wanted to use his two daughters to marry into other wealthy families.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Paula, Jeff would just be a loser.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Queenie thought about it, the angrier she became. The doctor at that time said that Steven could not be cured. But half a year later, Steven stood up and could see again.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whenever Queenie thought about this, she became angry and regretful.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shouldn't have left Steven when he was in the most difficult time.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was the richest person in Capitole.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stayed with Steven during his most difficult time.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie stood up suddenly with a mocking smile. How could a man like Steven be grateful?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="766.html">« Prev</a><a href="768.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
