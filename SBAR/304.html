Steven did this for Queenie but never made that kind of effort for you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, in the future, you must find a man who loves you wholeheartedly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Helen never made Diana feel pressured, as she understood the hardships of being a woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In this world, women already bear many burdens, and running a business is even more challenging.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Who doesn't grit their teeth to get through every challenge? Monthly periods with cramps make things worse; household chores and children's needs must be managed alongside a career.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isn't the chaos of each day just a means to live the life one truly wants?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana nodded with a smile. "Alright, Grandma, I promise you. I will be happy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though Helen felt reluctant, she still smiled. "Diana, you must be happy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana nodded with a smile, noting that Leopold wasn't home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had dinner with Helen, which included her favorite cakes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana ate happily, and Helen even packed some for her to take home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Knowing Diana's love for cakes, she had the kitchen make extra.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Diana left, Steven came downstairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Helen saw him, her expression remained indifferent, and she didn't say much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Leaving?" she asked flatly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was slightly surprised and smiled. "Grandma, you always reminded me to treat Diana better whenever I visited."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Despite my many reminders, you never really treated her well. I asked Diana to come today to see how she was doing. I'm relieved that she's moved on and no longer likes you. After all, you're not worthy of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your father was unruly in his youth, and we couldn't control him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I also failed to raise you well; you still don't understand gratitude. But don't worry, I'm old and won't interfere much in your affairs. Each generation has its destiny. Whether success or happiness, it's up to you. I'm not someone who enjoys meddling in others' lives."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Helen finished speaking and went upstairs. Though she claimed not to be disappointed, her heart said otherwise. She truly disliked scheming women like Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven stood still, his proud gaze clouded with uncertainty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In his mind, Diana's words echoed loudly, "Grandma, I loved Steven for four years and never made him love me. We weren't meant to be. Loving someone once brought me down to the dust, but now I want to rise above the clouds, not let myself down, nor waste my life anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"From now on, in a future without Steven, I will smile happily."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, it turned out that loving someone could also mean stopping anytime.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was what he felt for Queenie really love?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What was it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't explain it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff returned home, but the house was a mess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His mother's arrival turned the place upside down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, he realized that the company was truly in crisis.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="303.html">« Prev</a><a href="305.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
