Steven is your future sister-in-law..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's your sister-in-law, not mine." Diana interrupted Queenie, "Be careful when you speak. Don't tie me to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie smiled and thought, "She becomes smarter and more ruthless now, but it does mean I couldn't do anything to her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie smiled and said, "That's right. You signed the severance agreement and have nothing to do with our family. I shouldn't tie you to me. After all, you are just an orphan."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her implication was that the identity of an orphan was humble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled coldly, "Queenie, it seems that you finally have some self-awareness. You are such a vile person. It's disgusting being family with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's eyes were full of anger. "Steven, she is from the countryside and vulgar."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven took a step forward and said in a calm tone, "Diana, you are my wife. Don't speak so harshly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was amused by his shameless words. She rested her chin on her hands, looking up and down at Steven's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She said, "Steven, this is the first time I've heard you say this. If you said this half a year ago, I would be happy because you acknowledged my identity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I don't need it now. Take back what you just said."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven looked deeply at her mocking eyes and said nothing. Diana didn't seem to love him anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He felt a pain in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's eyes suddenly turned cold. She stood up, looked at Olivia and said, "Olivia, let's go to another restaurant."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Olivia said, "Yeah!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They were about to leave. And Queenie boasted about her achievements. "Diana, Steven invested in my new drama. Have you seen the news?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana nodded. "Yes. You dare to make a movie with so much scandals on your body. I'll give you a gift when the movie is successfully made."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie laughed loudly. She was not afraid at all and thought Diana would have been dead by that time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie pretended to be sad and asked, "Diana, why are you always targeting me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana said, "You misunderstand. I'm keeping you alive so that you can send those unscrupulous people in the Marsh family to hell for me. So, even if I have evidence, I won't expose you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie frowned and thought Diana was becoming increasingly difficult for her to understand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana should not know Queenie's plan. Queenie's eyes became strange and deep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked at Penelope with amusement. The next one was Penelope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Penelope felt uneasy when she saw Diana's look. Diana once said that Penelope was just a pawn of Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But up to now, Penelope had only lost Gale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, there would never be another man in this world who treated her as well as Gale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if he was disabled, at least he would help Penelope raise her baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie, I'll leave you and Mr. Gellar. I'm going to the hospital to see Gale."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Penelope left after saying this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven also turned around and wanted to leave. Queenie quickly grabbed his wrist and said, "Steven, aren't you going to have lunch with me? Andrew's people are watching us in secret. If you leave now, he will be unhappy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I just want to help you avoid his blame. I have no other intentions. Just have lunch with me."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="238.html">« Prev</a><a href="240.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
