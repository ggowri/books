Is your love just this? You are just like those scumbags. Just cancel it. Without you, I can meet someone better."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Frank could say anything, Elsie ran away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank chased after her. He had to get back the money he had given her before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't let Elsie take away his money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana and Paige stood up. The show was over, and it was time for them to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Queenie stopped them angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Diana, Jeff was furious. "Diana, are you happy now? You ruined Frank's wedding."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked at him with cold eyes. "I ruined it? Are you blind or brainless? Why do you put all the blame on me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff choked with anger. "How dare you talk to me like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana said coldly, "I'm just treating you the same as you do. I have already warned you. Don't mess with me, or I will make&nbsp;public what&nbsp;you&nbsp;have done."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff was stunned, thinking, "What have I done before? I did a lot of mean things, and I hid them well. How could Diana know?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige looked at Jeff with contempt. Although Jeff was an elder, she didn't want to respect him because he didn't deserve it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige said, "Let's go, Diana. No matter what you say, he won't believe you. He and Queenie are the same type. Even if you are right, you can't change their minds. They are shameless."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff was angry. "Paige, you damn girl. How dare you talk to me like this? My son doesn't marry you. Why don't you think about your faults? You're taking revenge like this, huh?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was shameless, knowing how to hurt others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige laughed in anger. She looked at Jeff's livid face and smiled gratefully, "I should thank Frank. If it weren't for him, who wronged me every time, I would still like him as always.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Later, I saw his true colors. It's great that he didn't choose me. I will meet someone better in the future. I will meet someone better in the future, and my future father-in-law will definitely not be someone like you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, I'm excellent, and Frank doesn't deserve me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You..." Jeff was in a rage, feeling dizzy and staggering back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Paige, you ruined Frank's wedding, and you are still so arrogant." Queenie looked gloomy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie thought, "Elsie failed to marry Frank. If Frank cheers up, I will have one more opponent."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige stepped back in disgust. "Don't talk to me. You make me sick. Your mouth stinks. Didn't you brush your teeth this morning?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="376.html">« Prev</a><a href="378.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
