"I know what you've been planning. Don't even think about getting a single cent out of me." "Honey, I'm serious. You can see our situation for yourself. How about you invite Steven over tomorrow night? Let's have Queenie marry into his family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This was her real aim. If Diana wanted a divorce, she would gladly offer her a hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven was not a good match for her dear daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alexander, with whom Diana went on a blind date that day, left a good impression on Paula.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jeff avoided her eyes, thinking that she'd found something out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Yet, from her words, it seemed that she still cared about Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Alright, let's prepare a good meal tomorrow. I'll invite Steven over. We have to deal with it after all. Diana still refuses to divorce..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Jeff, it's Steven who won't divorce. We need to persuade him to get rid of Diana and marry Queenie." Paula interrupted, not wanting to hear any more insults about her daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm unworthy of being Diana's mother," she sighed deep in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jeff was more of a jerk. He not only swapped her daughter with the one of his mistress, but fooled her into raising that girl. Paula found it hard to hold back her impulse to slay that son of bitch for revenge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What's worse, Jeff still wanted to take advantage of the Barnes family and give all her money to Queenie and his illegitimate son. How shameless!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jeff froze. "Isn't Steven eager for a divorce? Now that Diana has agreed, what is he hesitant about?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Could it be that he has regretted?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jeff felt slightly uneasy. "Diana and Steven are still married. Are we pushing him too hard by doing this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula answered coldly, "Why would that be the case? We just need to persuade him into divorcing Diana."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jeff couldn't wait to make Steven his daughter's husband considering his family background.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With his help, it would be much easier to take over all the estate of the Barnes family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Therefore, Jeff agreed to invite Steven over the next day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula slept soundly that night, but Jeff grew anxious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He tried hard to have an erection, but failed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jeff went frustrated. Why was this happening?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was only fifty!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He didn't sleep a wink all night, and thus was mentally exhausted by morning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula, however, had a sound sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jeff dragged himself downstairs listlessly, his heart pounding with unease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing Queenie at the table, he went straight to her and asked her to invite Steven over for dinner so that their engagement would be discussed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He knew that Steven's father had returned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Considering the deep conflicts between this father and son, Jeff decided not to invite him this time. It was wise to placate Steven before making further plans.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie was overjoyed. She was confident that she could lure Steven over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Okay, Dad, I'll take care of it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie called Steven after lunch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Hello!" There came his deep voice from the other end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie was thrilled. He finally picked up her call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Steven, you finally answered my call! I knew you wouldn't ignore me. Could you come to my house for dinner tonight? I've found some evidence about why your mum fell ill, and want to share it with you."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="101.html">« Prev</a><a href="103.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
