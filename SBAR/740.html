She murmured, "Mom, Dad's demanding I give him a million dollars a year as a pension. But I know it's never going to be enough. He knows my secrets and is threatening to use them against me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of Jeff's endless greed, Queenie already regretted everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All Jeff did now was blame Amelie and Queenie for ruining his happiness, always clinging to memories of Paula's kindness from the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These days, Jeff often lost himself in his own little world, replaying memories with Paula, each moment growing more vivid in his mind. He had no hesitation in pushing away those who actually cared about him, fully wrapped up in his nostalgia.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie knew Jeff's nature all too well.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news sent Amelie into a fit of fury. "He's a useless jerk! You're his daughter, and instead of helping you, he's trying to use you? What kind of father is that? Only that fool Paula could treat him like he's something special."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie couldn't help but envy Jeff. After all, Paula had truly been good to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula made sure he had three home-cooked meals each day, bought him every new season's clothing, and never hesitated to shower him with luxury cars and designer watches.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a fraction of that money would have been enough for Amelie to live a life of extravagance.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie understood how much Paula cared for her father. She actually regretted leaving Paula, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, Paula had gone out of her way to find her limited-edition clothes each month. Now, Queenie had to take care of that herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd once lived like a princess, and Diana's suffering had only served to highlight her own blissful life.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a bitter smile, Queenie said softly, "Mom, Paula really was wonderful."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Amelie's face hardened. She sneered, "Paula was wonderful, was she? Then why did you scheme against her? Why didn't you just let her stay as your mother?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the mockery in Amelie's eyes, Queenie dropped her head, at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew the answer. Her real mother cared only about money and couldn't have cared less about her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie took a deep breath. She still felt that Jean was more like a daughter to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least Jean always thought about her in everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People leaned on their own prejudices, believing what felt right to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she knew she couldn't voice this. After all, saying it would only drive a wedge between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, Queenie. That's all in the past. Don't bring it up again. Now, what's that plan you mentioned?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie knew Queenie wasn't ready to give up on Paula. Paula had spoiled Queenie like a little princess, while she herself could give Queenie nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She realized there would be a rift between them sooner or later.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Queenie would eventually see it, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie gathered herself and looked at the woman in front of her. Amelie was her birth mother, and she had cared for her all these years.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie told herself this just to ease her own regret, to make herself feel that she wasn't making a wrong choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad cheated on Paula with a secretary once. I have proof. You could use it to force him to divorce. But you'll need to have Mark give my dad five million dollars as a lump sum."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie stared at Queenie in shock. Queenie's eyes were blank and cold. Amelie's thoughts swirled. "Is five million all it takes to sever family ties?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, in Queenie's eyes, the family could simply be bought off?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In all her years, although she was selfish, Amelie had never considered using money to sever family bonds.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie gave a small smile, realizing. "Turns out, we're both just as selfish."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie then asked, "Mom, are you sure you and Mark can get married?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="739.html">« Prev</a><a href="741.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
