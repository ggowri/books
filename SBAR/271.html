Diana was confused. "Steven, you're an absolute bastard. After all the fuss you made about wanting a divorce, I signed the damn divorce papers. Why are you still playing these games with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her anger bobbled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Getting a divorce shouldn't be this hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She took a steadying breath before continuing, "You don't have to divorce me, but I'm going public with Queenie's status as a mistress. Every penny of the 5 million dollars you gave her each month during our marriage, I'll reclaim, legally if I must.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you might not care about hurting Queenie, I'm not afraid to lose it all, either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I signed those divorce papers and kept your affair under wraps just to preserve some dignity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just then, Frank had the audacity to come here and berate me, saying I was the one holding up the divorce. He claimed that I was the one standing in the way of your happiness with Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven, I might have been the one who fell in love first in this marriage, but from the start, both the Marsh family and you were using me. I knew it all along, but because I loved you, I let myself be used.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When Queenie came back, I tried to fight for a place in your heart, but after being framed over eighty times and facing your constant mistrust, I was completely disillusioned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's why I wanted a divorce."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven clenched his fists. She had cared for him through those two years, through more than eighty instances of framing, yet he had never once believed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And she had known from the beginning that he was exploiting the management rights she had secured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven had always been puzzled about why his grandfather had insisted he marry Diana in the first place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, he needed to uncover the person behind Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't the time to have a falling out with Queenie. That person looked exactly like him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, aside from being grateful to Queenie for saving me, I've never had an affair with her. I've never touched another woman. The man in those photos and videos you saw isn't me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The debt of gratitude he owed Queenie for saving his life was now wiped clean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for the money given to Queenie, he would retrieve it and give it all to Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie had deceived him more than once.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was visibly affected by his words. He was grateful to Queenie for saving his life, but if Diana hadn't dragged him from that fire years ago, there would be no Steven today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've said it before, I never saved you. It was Queenie who saved you. Divorcing me to marry Queenie is your best choice."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven witnessed the unmistakable intensity of her anger burning through. It was he who had betrayed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He could sense the palpable waves of her intense hatred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana..." He seemed on the verge of saying more, but after one last look, he quickly left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He mused silently, "She was smart. She would understand in time."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="270.html">« Prev</a><a href="272.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
