Here's my business card. If there are any projects we can collaborate on, please do give me a call. Thank you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled as he accepted the card, a simple lavender-colored one with just her phone number and name on it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright!" he nodded gracefully. Then, they enjoyed a wonderful evening.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After dinner, Alexander had something to take care of and left first. He had just returned and had a lot to handle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Alexander left, Diana stepped outside. She ran into her grandfather. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was speechless. It turned out he was watching them the whole time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold asked excitedly, "Diana, see? I wasn't lying, was I? He's really a good man."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at the proud old man and smiled, nodding. "You have great taste. We had a pleasant chat."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Diana finished speaking, she felt a chilly sensation. She looked up sharply and saw Steven standing across from her. She was stunned. What was Steven doing here?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at him awkwardly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had heard her conversation with her grandpa just now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Good. They were already divorced anyway.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She straightened up, ignoring the cold aura coming from Steven. This guy only showed warmth when he was with Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Happily, she linked arms with her grandpa, smiling as brightly as a flower. "Grandpa, Olivia, let's go home. I've already made plans to meet with Mr. Powell tomorrow. He just returned. I'll show him around."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Leopold couldn't stop grinning. "That's wonderful! Diana, you've got such great taste. He's indeed a handsome man. But with your beauty, you can easily seduce him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was shocked. She had no idea why her grandpa was acting this way today.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But you need to make sure he only shows off his charm in front of you, so he won't attract unwanted attention.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But I doubt he'll ever want to look at another woman once he has you.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander is a good man, unlike that pathetic Steven."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's eyes widened. He was clearly offended.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana chuckled helplessly. "Grandpa, let's go home."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven blocked Diana's path, his face furious. "Diana, can we talk?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at him in confusion. "What is there to talk about? Haven't we already discussed everything? When I left, all I took was the outfit I was wearing that day. Do you want money from me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven frowned. Did she think he was that petty?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We're not divorced yet," Steven said seriously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's your problem. You were the one who signed the divorce agreement first. And I signed it too. Just ask Evan to finalize the paperwork, or if you want, I can go personally tomorrow."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was very cooperative. All she wanted to do was finally getting over with it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was lucky. Tonight's events wouldn't change her place in Steven's heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the previous life, after Diana died, Queenie schemed against Steven once, forcing him to marry her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But even without that scheme, Steven would have married Queenie anyway.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, the person Steven always wanted to marry was Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this life, Diana decided not to get in their way.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And she wouldn't stop Paula and the others from self-destructing either.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven saw how determined she was, so he asked again, "Have you really decided?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Having watched her go on a blind date with another man, Steven was furious like a storm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought he was insane. Wasn't he the one who always wanted a divorce?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, it's you who's been insisting on a divorce. I'm granting you and Queenie your wish. You two really are a sweet couple, a match made in heaven. I wish you both a happy marriage and many children.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, ex-husband, there's nothing more to talk about between us. Bye!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three of them left, chatting and laughing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven watched Diana's figure disappear, burning with rage.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He turned and left, getting back into his car. Closing his eyes, feeling a slight discomfort, he ordered, "Take me home."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan glanced at him. Steven leaned back, exhausted. "Boss, Ms. Marsh has been calling you nonstop, asking you to drop by."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven thought of Queenie's tear-streaked face. Something felt off about tonight's events. Recalling what the old lady had said, he frowned. "Tomorrow, I want you to investigate why the old lady fell into the water."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="33.html">« Prev</a><a href="35.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
