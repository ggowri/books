She wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t wrong, just unwilling to accept failure. She longed to become a celebrated business queen, but she didn</span><span>'</span><span>t know where her obsession stemmed from.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A voice deep inside her kept reminding her that she must become that person.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie refused to remain a hidden illegitimate daughter; she wanted to be the high-ranking wealthy lady of the Marsh family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hoped her life would be as noble and luxurious as Diana's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over the years, Queenie had used the Marsh family's finest resources to master the rules of high society, and she had even perfected the art of crime.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had once experienced love and friendship, and she no longer needed them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From now on, she only needed to move forward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie whispered to the sky, "Queenie, keep moving forward. You need nothing, just rely on yourself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold was right, she couldn't always rely on others; only she was the most dependable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the bar, Diana stood before twenty go-go dancers, each over six feet tall, handsome, and pleasing to the eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She carefully observed them, growing happier the more she looked, unconsciously smiling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stood aside, noticing her engrossed expression, his face darkened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Does she really enjoy looking at handsome guys that much?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are these men more handsome than me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There's no denying, Diana's taste must be off."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana casually glanced at the twenty go-go dancers, who occasionally struck poses and winked at her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, Diana was a rare stunning beauty.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Facing their gazes, Diana blushed. Even though she claimed to like handsome guys, she became very shy when she encountered them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias and Julius were already used to it, while Leopold cheerfully watched Diana pick go-go dancers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sweet pea, is there anyone you like?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana squinted her eyes and smiled, "Grandpa, you never disappoint me, they are all very handsome."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this compliment, the twenty go-go dancers immediately grinned from ear to ear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled and explained, "Don't get me wrong. What I need are models who can showcase themselves on the runway. If you're interested in acting in short dramas, I can let you play the lead role. I have only one condition&mdash;you must be absolutely loyal to the company."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The twenty go-go dancers were stunned, unable to believe such a lucky opportunity had come their way.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They originally thought they'd have a romantic encounter tonight, but they didn't expect to get a job opportunity instead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing them stunned, Diana asked in confusion, "Don't you want to?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One bold go-go dancer smiled and said, "We thought you wanted to spend the night with us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's gaze instantly turned sharp, scaring the go-go dancer into shrinking his neck.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt a chill run down her spine upon hearing that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are you thinking? I'm already married," she quickly clarified.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's grim expression finally softened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Turns out she wasn't here for fun but to deliberately provoke him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He spent the whole night on edge, afraid she might date one of the go-go dancers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The twenty go-go dancers looked disappointed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's gaze grew colder, thinking, "Why do they look so disappointed?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Could these people actually dare to do something to my wife?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling Steven's cold gaze, the go-go dancers shuddered together.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana continued, "Our company offers great benefits. If you enjoy this kind of work, stay. If not, you can leave."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as she finished speaking, ten people had already left. Then, she asked Paige to train the remaining ten.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the ten go-go dancers standing there, Paige said happily, "Diana, they all look so handsome. I'll take them to sign the contracts, leave the rest to me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana replied cheerfully, "Alright! I know you can do it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she suddenly pointed at Tobias and Julius, saying, "Paige, these are my two brothers, and they're both still single. Do you need to exchange contact information?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paige stayed silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias and Julius were stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, I don't want to date right now," Tobias quickly declined. He preferred mature women over someone as gentle and virtuous as Paige.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julius fell in love with Paige at first sight. He extended his hand and said, "Hi, I'm Diana's brother, Julius."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two hit it off and quickly exchanged contact information.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, Paige left with the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold grinned from ear to ear and said, "Sweet pea is so thoughtful. She even considers her brother's marriage."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana raised an eyebrow at Julius. "Julius, go for it. Paige is great."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julius blushed and smiled, "Alright."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She reminded Tobias, "Tobias, Olivia is temporarily staying at home. You should pay more attention to her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias smiled indulgently and said, "Don't worry. I'll be staying in the country for a month and will take good care of her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, Diana's birthday party came to a successful conclusion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone happily went home.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana still went home with Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the way back, Tobias couldn't help but ask Leopold, "Who exactly is the man beside Diana?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold smiled at him and said, "Stop being curious about your sister's affairs. You should focus on your work so you can help her in the future."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias smiled and said, "Grandpa, I understand. I'm just worried she'll be deceived again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold said unhappily, "Don't underestimate your sister. She's just too naive."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julius chuckled and said, "Grandpa, why not just say she's dumb?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold glared at both of them and said, "You're her brother. What nonsense are you talking about? Diana may seem naive on the surface, but she knows very well in her heart. She's no longer that innocent now, and she has a bright future ahead."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias and Julius were most worried about her getting hurt by a man again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the car, sensing Steven's indifference, Diana wisely kept silent and ignored him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clearly, he was the one who got angry for no reason, but Diana felt like she had done something wrong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back home, they each freshened up, and neither said a word first.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Diana came out of the shower and found Steven still in her room, she immediately became displeased. "Why aren't you going to sleep yet?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Steven showered, he wore light gray loungewear, his faintly visible muscle lines particularly alluring.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's heart raced, feeling he was definitely trying to seduce her on purpose.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "He's so cunning. Does he want to sleep with me again tonight?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Strangely enough, having him by her side always made her sleep especially soundly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven patted the spot beside him, signaling her to come over and sit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was wary of him. "What do you want?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven remained silent, pointing to the spot beside him, and said in a low voice, "Diana, come sit next to me."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1075.html">« Prev</a><a href="1077.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
