Steven really did have an incredible build.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His looks and figure were both striking.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was taken aback, thinking, "This woman is bold, inviting him so openly."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze was practically devouring Steven, filled with an intense desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana found it strange. She and Steven had been physically close before, but it had always felt subtle, lacking the thrill novels described.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven didn't respond to the woman's invitation; instead, he glanced down at Diana beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was lost in her own thoughts. She wasn't jealous that another woman had invited her husband to a hotel; instead, she remained calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if she truly didn't know him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had once loved Steven deeply, willing to give everything for him. Even when her efforts went unrewarded, she only felt regret, never bitterness.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never demanded anything from Steven, only hoped he wouldn't misunderstand her as others had.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone, she thought, did foolish things in their youth, believing in all things beautiful and ideal.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, she chose to keep her distance from Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If these women could convince him to divorce her, she'd be delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, what's on your mind?" The woman finally couldn't resist linking her arm through his.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned slightly. Seeing Diana's lack of reaction, he nodded, "Alright."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana heard his answer and raised an eyebrow, feeling no upset at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She realized that her former affection for him had gradually faded under the weight of disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the elevator doors opened on the fifth floor, she walked out quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's gaze followed her, cold and sharp. He hadn't expected her to truly be indifferent to him going to a hotel with another woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan watched Steven's stubborn reaction, feeling at a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan didn't know what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just realized Diana now had yet another reason to dislike Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, we're here. Let's hurry up; Owen has probably been waiting," the woman said. Her name was Yvette King, a friend of Owen's.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She liked Steven's depth and composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what she liked even more was his wealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven showed no emotion, giving Yvette a dispassionate glance as he walked out of the elevator.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvette, who had worked abroad previously, didn't know Diana or that Steven was married. Hardly anyone knew of their marriage. It was something only their families were aware of.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't know Yvette either. She'd had little interaction with Owen and thus wasn't familiar with his friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen enjoyed teasing others but wasn't one for gossip.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven strode ahead. Noticing Diana enter the room next to theirs, he walked over swiftly. Peeking inside, he saw Alexander standing up courteously, holding out her chair.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana beamed with a radiant smile, and a pang struck Steven. That smile, he thought, should have been for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her laughing so brightly for another man while she treated him with cold detachment, he strode in abruptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had just taken her seat. Seeing Steven barge in, she was startled.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven took her surprise as disapproval of his sudden entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at Steven, a slight frown crossing his face. He gave a cool smile and said, "Mr. Gellar, here for lunch as well?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven replied in an even tone, "Mr. Powell, seeing you here, I thought I'd come say hello. Mr. Powell, may I ask why you invited my wife here today?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="746.html">« Prev</a><a href="748.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
