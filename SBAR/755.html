Steven brought me, instead of you, to so many business banquets. Everyone knows that I, Queenie, am his fiancee, and that you're just my foil. Yet you still shamelessly follow him around.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Diana, why don't you just die?]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Diana, you lowly woman, don't you have a lot of backbone? Steven has scolded and humiliated you like that, but you still refuse to leave!]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Diana, take your dignity and get out of Capitole!]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Diana had fallen asleep and had no idea that Queenie had bombarded her with messages.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How crazy was Queenie? Even when Steven returned home, Queenie was still bombarding Diana with messages.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first thing Steven did when he got home was to go to Diana's room.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that she had fallen asleep, he felt helpless and disappointed. She really wouldn't wait for him to come home.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood aside, looking down at Diana who was sleeping peacefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was wearing a silk shirt, sleeping on her side with the neckline a little too open. The half-covered soft part was round and full, perfect enough for his hand to completely cover it. His breathing suddenly stopped, and his heart skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her bright red lips and smooth breathing instantly aroused him. She didn't have to do anything but lie there quietly, and he would want to kiss her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Buzz..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven heard that Diana's phone was buzzing. He picked it up and was surprised to find that her phone did not have a password lock.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana hated unlocking her phone, and since she had no guilty conscience, she didn't set a password lock.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven saw that the messages were sent by Queenie. For half an hour, Queenie had been cursing Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eyes grew colder. He knew Queenie was vicious, but he didn't expect her to be disgusting too.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scrolled down and saw the photo Queenie sent to Diana. It was a photo of him and Yvette sitting together.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Below it were the messages Queenie sent to insult Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven clenched his hands into fists. "This damn woman is so vicious!" he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He deleted the photo because he didn't want Diana to see it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, he put down her phone and went to the bathroom to take a shower.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie, who didn't get a reply, was unwilling to give up.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sent Mario a message, asking him to check Yvette's identity information.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had her back now. As long as she kept coupling herself with him, she would have a steady stream of resources.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zion was willing to find her in person because of her relationship with Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Amelie came in with beef broth. Seeing Queenie on her phone, she said angrily, "Queenie, didn't I tell you to lie down and rest? You can't be tired these days. Can't you consider your health?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie looked at the broth in her hand with disgust. "Mom, I'm fine. Why are you giving me this? I don't like it. I want iced lemonade."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie suddenly thought of Paula. If it were her, she would do her best to cook her whatever she wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie said with a smile, "Queenie, broth is the most nutritious food after an abortion. Besides, where can I get you iced lemonade on this island? I'll make you some after we go back."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Iced lemonade? You're spoiled by Paula! Isn't the broth nutritious?" she thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie thought of where she was and gave in. Here, no one would find out that she had an abortion.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took the broth, put it on the table beside her, and took small bites.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching her eat slowly, Amelie lost patience. "Queenie, Steven hasn't called you in the past two days. What's going on between you and..."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="754.html">« Prev</a><a href="756.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
