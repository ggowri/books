What's happening to me? Lately, I've been experiencing hallucinations, seeing strange things that vanish upon a second glance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just now, I couldn't recognize my own daughter."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff was visibly shaken, gripping Rowan's arm tightly, desperate for answers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The recent events had taken a toll on him both mentally and physically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rowan looked at him seriously and replied, "Mr. Marsh, based on the latest tests, you not only have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high blood sugar, but also heart disease. There's a possibility of Alzheimer's. You need to watch your diet and stick to lighter meals."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff thought of his fondness for tasty dishes, especially those packed with calories like pizza and roast beef.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But from now on, he had to switch to a lighter diet to improve his condition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, Dr. Cruz, I'll work with you to treat my disease," Jeff said, fearing that he might be seriously ill and unable to support his son in fulfilling his dreams.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rowan nodded and advised him to go back and get some rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon after Jeff left, Paula entered the room. She overheard the conversation between Jeff and the doctor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aware of Jeff's hypertension, high cholesterol, and high blood sugar, she had always been mindful of his diet. She had managed it well in the past, and he had never fainted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, after she found out about his adultery, she stopped bothering about his meals. In just two months, his health began to deteriorate. Yet she couldn't simply ignore him. She wanted to make Jeff and his mistress suffer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dr. Cruz, can Jeff's illness be cured?" Paula inquired, hoping for insight on any toxins detected by Rowan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Pay attention to his diet and adhere to his medication, Mrs. Marsh. He will gradually improve," Rowan replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula realized no toxins had been found. As expected, even the doctor couldn't detect the virus in the medicine Jeff had given her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, she had given it all to Jeff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Feeling reassured, Paula thanked the doctor with a smile and left the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the hospital entrance, she ran into Frank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, how is Dad? Is he feeling better?" Frank's attitude softened a lot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula gazed at him. Frank and Diana bore the closest resemblance to her, but his personality took after Jeff's more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She stared at Frank with an ambiguous look, making Frank feel uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did you go to see Diana this morning?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes. She should leave town and shouldn't meddle in Steven and Queenie's relationship," Frank said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula felt a pang in her heart. They could see through Queenie's facade, yet they blindly sided with her. However, no matter what Diana did, it was wrong in their eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her eyes welled with tears, and she choked out, "What did she say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank angrily relayed, "She insulted me, saying I'm an idiot."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula's heart ached, and she walked away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought, "Diana spoke the truth, but how did she know? Is Elsie also a pawn of Queenie's?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula's legs gave out, and she collapsed to the ground in an instant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The pain from her knee made her face pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom..." Frank called out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stay away from me." Paula shook off his hand, stood up, and limped away without a glance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't know what she had done to deserve being tricked and betrayed by Jeff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And her sons were all stubborn and never listened to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank stood bewildered, wondering what happened to Paula.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="275.html">« Prev</a><a href="277.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
