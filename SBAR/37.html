"That's so sweet of you. Alright, I'll buy things for myself as well.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You've been exhausted these past few days too, so get some rest. I'll find a way to resolve the issue with Diana. Ever since she came back, our family hasn't had a moment of peace.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll find her a place outside so she can live away from here."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was the best solution. After all, she was still her biological daughter, so she couldn't just ignore her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana hadn't finished high school and didn't have a stable income. How had she even survived the past four months?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But remembering Diana's words, Paula felt disgusted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She could only make up for Diana with money&mdash;there was no other way.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff's original plan was to never let Diana come back. He didn't care if she was his biological daughter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A useless person like her would only tarnish his reputation. Everything was meant for Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright." Jeff pretended to be worried. "After all, she's our daughter. Let's let her stay in that old, rundown house outside the city. We brought her back as an adopted daughter. Giving her that house is generous enough."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula nodded. "Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula thought to herself, "Diana, you can't blame me. If you want to blame someone, blame yourself. A daughter shouldn't try to ruin her parents' happiness."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Steven got home and looked at the cold, empty house, he felt a bit uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He never liked outsiders coming into his home. Other than the part-time cleaner, it was always Diana who took care of everything.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling irritated, he tugged at his tie and smiled bitterly to himself. How could such a vicious woman make him care so much?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But during the two years when he couldn't see anything, it was Diana who had taken care of him so meticulously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The more Steven thought about it, the more frustrated he became. He stood up and went upstairs to take a shower.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he walked upstairs, he couldn't help but feel uncomfortable thinking about Diana going on a date, smiling so happily at that man.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana returned home with Grandpa and Olivia.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana couldn't wait and dragged Olivia upstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia pulled her hand away. "Shoo, shoo, don't bother me. I want to read. I'm going to your study to read."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana argued, "The books are not going anywhere. Why are you in such a hurry?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia, visibly upset, said, "I'm going to read a relationship guide. This time, I'll make sure you find a good man. No more letting anyone break your heart again."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana froze, a warm feeling spreading through her heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Olivia, thank you! I'm over being a love-struck fool. I swear, I'm never going back to Steven again."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana jogged over and hugged Olivia. "Olivia, I'm sorry! I made you all worry. I won't do that anymore. From now on, I'll focus on being the best version of myself and running the business well to make Grandpa happy."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia patted her back firmly, feeling for all the pain Diana had endured over the years. She finally saw the light. "That's the right attitude! And no more being obsessed with love. I've done the math&mdash; you and Alexander are meant to be. Now hurry up, go put on a face mask and look gorgeous for your next meeting with Alexander. I'm off to read."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana laughed and agreed. "Alright, alright! Don't stay up too late. Your room is right next to the study, so after reading, you can sleep there."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia happily went away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana returned to her room, exhausted, and lay on her bed. Looking around the familiar space, she smiled, because she realized she could start everything anew.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Early the next morning, Diana was woken up by the sound of her phone ringing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She picked it up and saw it was Steven calling, reminding her about their divorce paperwork.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She quickly asked, "Steven, are we going to the city hall?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="36.html">« Prev</a><a href="38.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
