"Alright."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie was ecstatic at his quick agreement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She personally went out with the maids and chefs to buy ingredients and</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">even hired a five-star chef to prepare dinner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, Jeff and Paula were also busy making preparations at home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale continued working with the racing team.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In Steven's office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His face grew darker after he answered Queenie's call. How did she know about his mother's condition after she had left?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Unless... she never really left. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Could Evan's information have been right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven stood up, his long fingers tapping lightly on his desk. His brows furrowed, his expression unreadable as if lost in thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">For all day, he couldn't concentrate on his work, with his mind preoccupied with the note Diana had left him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"May my husband stay healthy and never need this medicine again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">These words revealed her deep love for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had never been loved before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He protected Queenie well because she was like a ray of light to him in the darkness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was always partial to Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But she seemed to have done nothing for him in return.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's gaze grew darker. He pressed the intercom and called for Evan to come.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A few minutes later, Evan entered</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Gellar, what can I do for you?" he asked humbly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven glanced sideways at him, his voice low, "Is Diana here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan shook his head. "No, I asked around. It's said that she works as a designer who doesn't need to clock in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was all Nolan's mistake. If not for him, his company wouldn't have been in trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Their designers, to put it mildly, couldn't be more disappointing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven lowered his eyes slightly with frustration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Go prepare a gift. We're going to the Marsh Villa tonight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan was startled. "Is he going to visit Queenie?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It makes sense that one can't let go of his childhood sweetheart."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan left to prepare the gift.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven sat back in his luxurious office chair lazily, feeling drowsy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His phone rang from the desk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven straightened up slightly to glance at the phone, and finally picked it up to check the message.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was a photo of Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was standing by the sea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In a white dress with cascading hair. Under the bright sunlight, with the breeze gently lifting a few strands of her hair, she was smiling radiantly like the sunshine itself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her wife Diana Bishop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In a picture of serenity and ineffable beauty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, Owen sent him another message.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"This is Diana. I ran into her at the beach. She's here with this guy."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="102.html">« Prev</a><a href="104.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
