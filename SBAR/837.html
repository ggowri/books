I just tried to chase after my mom, but she ignored me, and I got a bit upset, so I cried."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie frowned, anger simmering beneath the surface as she thought, "That selfish old woman!" She said, "Heartless! Just like that, she can cut ties?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jean forced a smile but didn't respond. Inside, she was thinking, "You're the most heartless one here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jean headed over to buy the shoes she had been eyeing earlier, plotting in her mind. "This woman thinks she can toy with my feelings? Just wait; I'll deal with her in my own time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie followed her, her mind racing with suspicion. "Why do I feel like Jean has changed? But she's so naive; she probably doesn't even notice anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Diana had spent several hours at Lily's home, finally sealing a deal for a collaboration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily had also mentioned avoiding sending Mark to prison, knowing full well that direct confrontation would be more devastating for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana respected her decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was around eight in the evening when she and Luna finally headed home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her surprise, the villa was brightly lit, and Steven was already back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Diana stepped into the foyer, she changed her shoes and removed her down jacket, still holding the kiwi and cherries Lily had prepared for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She loved those little treats. Just as she set everything down, her phone rang&mdash;it was Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey! Alexander!" Diana greeted cheerfully, her voice bright with happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, with a voice like that, you must be in a good mood," he replied. "I really am! Did you need something?" she asked, genuinely curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Actually, yes. The design sketches you sent over? Our team unanimously decided to make six of them limited editions. The others are already in production. Diana, your talent is simply incredible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana let out a sigh of relief. "Thank you, Alexander. This call will definitely help me sleep better tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, I stopped by your place earlier. Where were you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh... I haven't been staying there lately. Is there something urgent?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not really, just about the designs. Oh, and I brought you some crabs, so don't forget to eat them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, thank you so much, Alexander! Let me treat you to dinner sometime soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sounds good! I'll give you a heads-up when I'm free. Take care and get some rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana hung up, still smiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as she looked up, her smile faded when she saw Steven standing across from her, his expression gloomy and brooding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're back," she said coolly, her tone flat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why didn't you answer my calls?" he asked, his voice low and tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glanced at her phone, noticing the missed calls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, I had a busy evening and had my phone on silent. Did you eat dinner?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head. "No."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, Steven felt a wave of disappointment. In the past, whenever he came home, or Diana returned, the first thing she would do was check if he'd eaten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, even if she wasn't home, she didn't bother to ask how he was doing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana checked the time and frowned. "You haven't eaten yet? What's going on with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling exhausted, she tossed her jacket onto the sofa. "Let me whip up something for you. Just wait here a moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," Steven replied, though he felt a pang of sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had expected Diana to have dinner ready, thinking she would be waiting for him. Steven had left work early, around six, hoping to get home in time for a meal together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Steven stepped through the door, a sense of unease washed over him. The house, usually a sanctuary, felt cold and unwelcoming. The darkness that enveloped him mirrored the turmoil inside, leaving him feeling more lost than ever.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="836.html">« Prev</a><a href="838.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
