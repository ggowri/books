Look, Olivia is running ahead of us!" She was full of joy, so different from the reserved and dutiful way she acted around him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This lively, carefree Diana tugged at his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">[Steven, I've never seen Diana this happy. You should let her go.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven caught Owen's message, his face darkening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">[You don&rsquo;t have a say in my marriage.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">[Didn't you see how happy Diana is now? And Queenie is the woman you love.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's gaze grew even colder. Seemed that he himself was the only one in the world who failed to figure out his true feelings for these two girls.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ignoring Owen's further comments, he fixed his eyes on Diana's radiant smile, his emotions unreadable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tobias had some time off, and decided to take Diana out for fun.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Olivia was also free, so the three of them went to the seaside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Both Diana and Olivia loved the ocean, so Tobias brought them along to enjoy the beach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana had loved riding on Tobias' back in the waves since she was little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even now, she was still full of childlike joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Owen was also on vacation so he bumped into Diana at the beach.And Diana's sweet smile impressed him so much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He couldn't help but record a video and send it to Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Owen didn&rsquo;t think himself a gentleman, but he would never make the same mistake as Steven had done&mdash;marrying Diana but still being obsessed with Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What a scumbag!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie was demanding, but in the eyes of Steven, she was perfect. Steven saw Queenie humiliate Diana, but did nothing to stop her. Obviously, that was only because he didn't love Diana that much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Though not interested in most women, Owen still felt that Steven was going too far.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Due to her deep love for Steven, Diana often cared about Steven&rsquo;s whereabouts. After he had a car accident, Diana spared no effort to take care of him. If not for her, Steven wouldn't have recovered this soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Yet, everything had changed since Queenie returned. Every time she got hurt, Diana would be accused of being the culprit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And everyone could see that Queenie wasn't the type of girl willing to face difficulties together with Steven...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Owen watched the three of them from afar. Olivia's dazzling smiling face caught his attention. Owen's eyes flickered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His phone vibrated. Owen turned to his phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">[Where are you?]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Owen knew immediately what he wanted.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="103.html">« Prev</a><a href="105.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
