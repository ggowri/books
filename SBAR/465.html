It seems Frank might be after Elsie. I'll check in with Diana later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie replied, "Eric, I really feel for Frank. Diana and Paige ruined his wedding. Diana just can't stand our family, and she's done everything to harm Gale and Frank."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, Queenie, just hang tight. I'll definitely find Frank. I know you care about him; after all, he's been the best for you. If something happens to him, you'll lose someone who loves you," Eric said before hanging up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie, who was on the set, suddenly sensed something off about Eric's tone. Why did he sound a bit sarcastic?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced around to make sure no one was listening and then called Felicity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felicity answered, "Ms. Marsh, how can I help you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie said triumphantly. "Felicity, get the funds ready. We're going to acquire Paula's company. In the next ten days, transfer 200 million dollars to her, and then we'll buy her company at a low price and win back the customers she lost before. The company will turn a profit in one year."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clients who had previously pulled out of their deals with Paula had been lured away by Queenie using another company. Now, as long as this company acquired Paula's, all those partnerships would revert to Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything Paula had toiled for would be snatched up by Queenie at minimal cost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had already contacted Elsie and learned that Frank was dead. If Queenie could frame Diana for it, she would be finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this period of being with Jace, Queenie had received several more investments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie didn't expect Steven to help her, but she needed to ensure he was on her side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felicity replied, "Ms. Marsh, I'm all set."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie said, "Great! Go negotiate with her. We'll offer her a billion dollars. She won't be able to refuse&mdash;she's already sold the building, but that won't cover her losses. What she doesn't know is that all that money ended up in my pockets. Thanks to that stupid Paula, we've made a fortune so soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felicity was thrilled. "Ms. Marsh, buying her company for a billion dollars will be a humiliation to her, but she won't be able to fight back. That money will eventually land in your hands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felicity's ambitions had grown, fueled by Queenie's success. With each victory, she became bolder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! I'm shooting and will be back in a few days. You handle the talks with her during this time," Queenie instructed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felicity assured her, "Don't worry, Ms. Marsh. I'll manage everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie added, "Good! Eric is back. Give him 100 thousand dollars and make sure he's out of the way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Marsh, we need to move quickly. Paula will catch wind of our plan soon. If your brothers find out, things will get complicated," Felicity cautioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie also sensed something was off about Eric's earlier comments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Gale and Frank's incidents, everyone would start feeling uneasy. She had been framing Diana, and now Paula and Steven were losing trust in her. But controlling Paula was difficult. Plus, Jeff had been acting crazy lately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of thought, Queenie said, "Felicity, Eric isn't useful anymore. Aside from complicating things for Diana, he doesn't serve a purpose. Get rid of him; I can't let him ruin my plans. He's too stubborn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Felicity asked, "Ms. Marsh, how do you plan to deal with him?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="464.html">« Prev</a><a href="466.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
