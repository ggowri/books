"Of course I want her to be happy, but she's too cruel.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"All these years, she's been bullying Queenie. It's because she knows you like Queenie, so she's been jealous and plotting against her. Take tonight, for example. If she had just explained from the start that she was the one who saved the old lady, Queenie wouldn't have had to suffer such grievances."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven frowned, staring at him. Evan's words echoed in his mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Her family doesn't care about her. When something goes wrong..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven paused, realizing that he, too, always assumed everything was Diana's fault.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Never did he try to find out the truth. Every time Diana did something, it made him furious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, you've suffered over the years. Diana is a country girl with no education or job. Now that you're divorced, I don't have to feel guilty anymore. I just want to see you live happily with Queenie," Jeff spoke with deep sincerity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula couldn't help but wonder why he was insulting his own daughter like that?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was affected by what Diana had said, and couldn't help but think about what he was implying.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula, fuming, said, "What are you talking about? Diana is our own daughter! If it weren't for the mix-up at birth, she'd be just as successful. How can you talk about your own daughter like that?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Paula stood up and went upstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff frowned&mdash;she wasn't like this before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he was running out of patience. He squinted his eyes slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his daughter marrying Steven, he'd have more leverage.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's face fell as he turned and left.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was taken aback.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff frowned again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie, upset, said, "Dad, you're pushing him too hard! Steven isn't like other jerks. He's been good to me all these years because I saved him. If I hadn't saved him, he probably wouldn't even look at me now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff, equally anxious, said, "That's exactly what I'm worried about! If he finds out it was Diana who saved him, then there'll be no chance for you two."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I just want you to get married soon. Once you're married and have kids, he won't ever think of leaving you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie curled her lips, stood up, and said, "Dad, this can't be rushed. Let's wait a bit longer. Oh, and make sure Mom takes her supplement."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff frowned without saying anything.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a moment of silence, he nodded lightly. "I know."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff stood up and went to the kitchen, taking Paula's supplement upstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula had just finished her bath, and seeing Jeff enter, she felt guilty. She shouldn't have doubted him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Paula, you've been so tired lately. Take this; it'll help you sleep better tonight, so you'll have energy to work tomorrow. The company's depending on you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula smiled gently, took the pill with water.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Jeff watched her finish it, a strange glint flashed in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula didn't notice; she was just thinking about how to make it up to him later.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She placed the bowl aside, turned to her bedside drawer, pulled it open, and took out an expensive tie to hand to him. "Honey, I bought this tie for you a few days ago. It is very expensive, so take good care of it, okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff happily took the tie, knowing she was trying to make up for her guilt. He knew her too well.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Paula, I have so many ties. Why waste money on more? Use the money to buy yourself clothes or take better care of yourself. Love yourself more."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff had a way with words and knew how to please women.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula was touched. Diana's wild accusations couldn't be true. How could the Jeff who always loved her possibly cheat on her? How could he do anything to betray her?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="35.html">« Prev</a><a href="37.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
