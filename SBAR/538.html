I'm going to be away for a couple of days. When I come back, I want to go abroad with you to discuss a cooperation. With the strength of the Farley family, we can negotiate it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After the negotiation, you will be the agent and I will be the sub-agent. We will each be in charge of our own regions. This will make me more money than if you gave me shares."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would not do such a thing as to put herself in a dilemma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Farley family was already in deep trouble, and the struggles among these family groups were bloodless but crazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I really can't do anything about you. Then, I'll wait for you to come back and contact me. I'll wait for your good news, and I won't miss any profitable business."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled lightly, "Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hung up the phone, and then she called Althea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, it's snowing on the island. Is it snowing over there, too?" Althea's voice sounded very happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked out the window and saw heavy snow falling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Althea, it's snowing here, too. The snow scene is beautiful. How are you feeling recently?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, my waist has been sore these past a few days. The doctor said I could give birth at any time, but my mother is overseas and can't come back. It's snowing heavily over there and the airport is closed. I'm a little worried." Her voice was full of worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said, "Don't worry, and I'll </span><span>be with</span><span> you tomorrow. If your waist aches, it means you're about to give birth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's great, Diana. I feel much more at ease now </span><span>that you will come</span><span>," Althea said with a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew that the joy of being pregnant and becoming a mother for the first time would make people very happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Althea, don't worry. I'll come over tomorrow. Have you bought everything you need?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Diana. I have everything I need except you," Althea said jokingly with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She really needed someone to be with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a single mother and might encounter various problems during the process of giving birth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea would be questioned by others, and she was also afraid of giving birth</span><span>. These things made her</span><span> very nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana chatted with her for a few words, and then she hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was still early, so she went upstairs to take medicine. After taking the medicine, Diana looked at the snow scene outside the window and gradually felt sleepy. She lay on the bed and wanted to sleep for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The video of Samuel's arrogance was widely circulated on the Internet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was with Rita at this time. He glanced at the news and sneered, "Grandma, this brat is spoiled by his mother. He speaks and acts arrogantly and lawless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rita sat elegantly on the sofa, her silver hair slightly curled and adorned with green jewels. She looked extremely noble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Rita looked at him with a loving smile. "Cecil, if you hadn't met Diana, you would be as lawless as Samuel, bullying others all day long, relying on your few stinky money to not take others seriously."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now you see it, if you hadn't met Diana, you would have been used by Queenie and become the person like Samuel. Queenie came up with another plan when one plan failed. If Diana hadn't found out her motives in advance, we would have been in a mess by now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil knew that all of this was the credit of Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was very confused and looked at Rita, asking, "Grandma, why doesn't she want the Farley family's shares?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana seemed to be very eager to make money, but if he gave her what she needed most, she would not accept it.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="537.html">« Prev</a><a href="539.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
