"Mr. Gellar, that's hard to say. We still don't know who this guy is, and Ms. Bishop is being pretty tight-lipped about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A flicker of sympathy crossed Evan's face. It seemed like Steven was finally coming to terms with the reality of his situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, Diana arrived home and received a message from Olivia saying she wouldn't be back tonight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana quickly typed back: [Olivia, stay safe out there.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In her previous life, Olivia was safe and sound; however, she did spend some time abroad. Diana, who was inseparable from Steven, never found out about Olivia's circumstances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, the Marsh family had no knowledge of Olivia, so naturally, she knew little about Olivia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Olivia replied: [Don't worry about me. Just making some cash.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana couldn't help but smile at that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With Tobias and Leopold still out, she flicked on the lights in her room, grabbed some clothes, and headed for the bathroom to shower.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After freshening up, she slipped into a white silk loungewear set and made her way to the study.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sitting at her desk, Diana pulled out her notebook and began sketching a relationship map regarding Queenie's next moves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She mused, "Harry's in prison now; so what's next? Where's that boy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In front of the Marsh family and Steven, Queenie played the part of a delicate flower, but if she hadn't been given a second chance at life, Diana wouldn't have realized just how formidable Queenie truly was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A straight-A student, a perennial winner of piano competitions, and a sensation at university parties&mdash;she was a force to be reckoned with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie was also savvy in finance and had even started her own company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula had groomed her well, and with the resources at her disposal, Queenie was on track to become a top-tier millionaire&mdash;rivaling Alexander in every way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, Steven was poised to fall victim to his own naivety and the harsh truths he had yet to confront.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That day, when Queenie and Steven had their explosive fight, something had felt off about him, but Diana hadn't been able to pinpoint what it was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana glanced at the calendar, her expression turning serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil hadn't contacted her lately, and his family's company was beginning to show signs of trouble, though it wasn't too severe yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Farley family still hadn't identified the root of the problem.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie's secret company, funded by the pocket money Steven had given her, was growing stronger with each passing day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had plenty of reasons to cling to Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana organized her thoughts about the key players involved, focusing on Jace's upcoming birthday party.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, she sprang to her feet and dialed Luna's number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Ms. Bishop," Luna answered, her voice cool and respectful as always.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Luna, I need you to keep a close eye on Queenie leading up to Jace's birthday party. Track her every move and report back to me daily. Who she meets is crucial, and I want photos of everyone she interacts with&mdash;no exceptions."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna hesitated, sensing the tension in Diana's voice. "Ms. Bishop, you seem on edge. Is something wrong?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="164.html">« Prev</a><a href="166.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
