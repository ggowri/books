Yanson's voice was full of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people around him couldn't help but burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen couldn't believe what he was seeing. Yanson was acting like a complete fool, and it was so embarrassing. If it were up to him, he would pretend not to know this guy at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd known Diana for years, but he'd never seen anything special about her. She was just a regular person to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, something about this situation had him curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to George and Queenie. "Queenie, is what Joshua said true? Is Diana really all that talented?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had seen Diana's abilities up close. She didn't want to admit it, but she knew deep down that Joshua wasn't lying. "Owen, I don't know if it's true or if she's just playing for attention. You know how she likes to spin stories."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen frowned. He'd underestimated Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought she was just some master manipulator, pulling the wool over everyone's eyes, even Joshua's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph. Diana's playing a long game. She's not getting away with this. She's cost my family a lot, and I won't let her off the hook."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word to George, Queenie, or Yvette, Owen stormed after Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George and Queenie exchanged a look, both of them wearing a mischievous grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson noticed their expressions and couldn't shake the feeling that something was off about Steven today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the two of them walked ahead, Yvette shot George a playful look, batting her eyelashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George gave her a sharp warning glance, but she only smiled and looked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's eyes narrowed. She couldn't help but wonder if the woman George was seeing was standing right in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She kept her thoughts to herself, but one thing was for sure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen would find a way to bring Diana down. And she and George would be more than happy to watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After chatting with a few important partners, Diana followed Joshua to a private lounge for dinner. He and Dalton had some business to attend to, leaving her to relax for a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna stayed by her side, but there was a puzzled look on her face. "Diana, Owen looks like he's about to do something crazy. Aren't you worried?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana casually picked up a small cake and took a bite before replying coolly, "Why should I be? Owen's a fool. He's just a pawn in Queenie's game. If he ends up with nothing, it's his fault. Queenie could even swallow up someone like Jace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Owen and Yanson? They don't even compare. In three months, Queenie will have Owen stripped of everything. And he'll probably thank her for it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew Queenie's ambition very well. Owen and Yanson were just stepping stones in her plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna still wasn't quite following. "But Diana, why warn Cecil and not Owen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes narrowed slightly, a small smirk playing at her lips. "Because Owen's not worth my time. He and Yanson are different from Cecil. Cecil's bad, but at least there's some good in him. These two? They're beyond saving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Owen's got a few profitable subsidiaries, but trust me, they're about to be Queenie's property. Just wait and see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen was headed for a downfall, and it wasn't going to be pretty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna didn't even feel sorry for Owen anymore. "But what about Queenie? She's the one who stole your designs, and now her line's a hit. She's raking in the money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes sparkled with amusement as she took another bite of cake, looking absolutely stunning under the soft lighting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Luna, grinning mischievously. "You're so eager. Don't worry about Queenie. We don't need to do anything. Just wait.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for her little success? This is her one shot. After this, there won't be another."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right, I'm waiting!" Luna said, her excitement palpable. "By the way, this marbled steak? Mr. Turner had it specially made for you. You should eat up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stared at the steak in front of her, feeling grateful for Joshua's thoughtful gesture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She picked up her knife and fork, cut a piece, and took a bite. It was delicious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna sat down and asked again, "Diana, why is Yvette here? What's her angle?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana furrowed her brow slightly but didn't seem too concerned. "It's nothing. She's part of the plan. I'm just waiting for her to make her move. But honestly, Owen and Yanson are going down first. They're the real fools in all of this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once Queenie takes them down, we'll only grow stronger. By the time she tries to turn on me, it'll be too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She might be good at scheming, but we're not stupid. We won't just wait around for her to attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, she's already got her hands full with the Foliot family. Their whole situation has turned into a mess. Mark's company was taken over by Jeff, so their family's been dealing with all that chaos lately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana chuckled, "Ah... this steak is amazing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Luna, you should eat, too. It'll get cold if you leave it too long."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna smiled and took a bite of her steak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, she grinned. "Wow! Mr. Turner knows how to treat us. This is top-tier marbled steak!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike Diana, Luna had a body that easily put on weight. She didn't dare eat too much, so she was careful with her food choices.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two women were happily eating their dinner, completely unaware of Owen standing just outside the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen was about to push the door open but froze, his hand suspended in mid-air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe what he was hearing and thought, "Queenie plans to target my company?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How is that possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind immediately went to the Foliot family, and a chill ran down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked over at Diana, who was laughing and eating, her smile as beautiful as ever. Seeing her like that, he suddenly felt a strange distance from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had said before that he was different from Cecil and that he was a born troublemaker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never had a good impression of Diana, and she didn't think much of him either. To her, he was just another bad guy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd heard about Cecil's situation, but he never paid it much attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, listening to Diana and Luna talk, he couldn't help but feel uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had already played her games with Cecil, the Foliot family, and some small businesses. He had assumed it was just her usual business tactics.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he realized that Queenie had gotten close to Jace because she had saved his granddaughter. That was why he had taken a liking to her. And now, she had turned around and taken over his entire company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also heard that Jace had fallen ill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a while, he had suspected that Queenie wasn't as innocent as she appeared. But after being led astray for so long, he didn't want to believe she could be that ruthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen abruptly turned and left. He couldn't let Queenie manipulate him. His company's position was built on its partnership with Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he turned, he almost bumped into Queenie and George.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, Steven, how about we all grab dinner together?" Owen said, his eyes narrowing as he concealed his usual arrogance. He just wanted to get a better read on Queenie's true intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had warned him before, but since he had always dismissed her, he hadn't taken her words seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's expression darkened when she saw him standing there. It seemed like he hadn't come to cause trouble for Diana after all.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="950.html">« Prev</a><a href="952.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
