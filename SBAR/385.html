"Diana, what's wrong with him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shook her head. "Who knows? Let's just get him to the island's hospital for treatment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige quickly tidied up, and together, they lifted Frank onto the speedboat, laying him flat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana handed Frank a pill. "I just gave you something to stop the bleeding. It's going to take another hour to get back. You'll have to hang in there. Whether you survive or not depends on you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank smiled faintly, "Diana, weren't we out here with Mom? Why are it just you two? Where's Mom? Where's Gale?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana stared at him in confusion. "What are you talking about, Frank? When did I ever go on a trip with you? Stop pretending you have amnesia. Once we reach the island, call your family to come take care of you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking into his bewildered eyes, Diana grew even more puzzled. She thought, "What is going on with him? Had he suffered such a severe mental and physical blow that it caused him to lose his memory?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige, equally shocked, thought to herself, "This guy's acting really strange. Something's definitely not right."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, do you remember? The year you were found and brought back home, Mrs. Paula Marsh took all of us out to another island. It seems like Frank's memory is stuck in that time," Paige said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She remembered vividly that outing with Frank. He had once held a place in her heart, much as she hated to admit it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But for Diana, those memories were too distant, spanning two lifetimes. She couldn't recall much of it at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were so few good memories, and all she could think about were the times they had bullied her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she navigated the speedboat, Diana cast a closer look at Frank. His expression was still one of dazed confusion, and it didn't seem like he was faking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, you just got back home, right? How about I take you out for something good to eat?" Frank said, smiling, though his head was spinning. He wondered, "Did I really fall into the ocean?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">My leg is throbbing in pain."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then he glanced over at Paige, thinking, "She looks thinner now, prettier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And she's dressed so seductively. Who is she trying to attract?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And Paige, your omelet are the best. Make sure to bring me some tomorrow morning, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige was furious. She glared at him fiercely. "You still want me to make you an omelet? Dream on! Be careful, or I'll make sure you choke on them! You're delusional.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And don't think that just because you've lost your memory, you can erase all the harm you've done to me. We ended things a year ago."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank froze, and an inexplicable wave of sorrow welled up in his chest, making his whole body tremble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't shake the feeling that Paige's eyes were suddenly so unfamiliar to him.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="384.html">« Prev</a><a href="386.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
