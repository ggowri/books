From the beginning, I knew you were scheming against Ms. Barnes. How could a father treat his daughter so badly?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I did some investigation and happened to find out that Amelie is your mistress. That&#x27;s how I discovered your affair, and out of goodwill, I informed Ms. Barnes.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">In her previous life, she had also figured it out. She had considered telling Paula, but Paula&#x27;s attitude toward her had been so terrible that she knew she wouldn&#x27;t believe her. She was too emotional. She didn&#x27;t just suffer losses. She lost her life!</p><p style="text-align:left;">Only after being reborn did she understand everything. Looking back, her previous life had been so foolish.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;What?&quot; Jeff was shocked. If Paula had never known, all his plans would have succeeded.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He screamed inwardly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">If Paula hadn&#x27;t known, he would be living happily now.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He staggered back a few steps, his face darkened. &quot;Diana, so you&#x27;re the one who ruined my plans? How could you be so bad?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He had wondered why Paula had suddenly changed, and now he realized. It was because she found out about his affair with Amelie and the existence of his biological daughter.</p><p style="text-align:left;">That was Queenie. He had thought he had succeeded in his scheme, but in the end, he was the one who had been schemed against.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana looked at him. He was enraged and disbelieving. She revived at Queenie&#x27;s birthday party. If she could choose, she wished she had revived before she met Paula and them.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She could have lived a carefree life abroad with her grandfather.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She would never have met these people or had any ties to Steven.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She wouldn&#x27;t have gone through this pain.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Yes! I ruined your plans. From the beginning, my goal was to make you lose. When you asked me to sign the severance agreement, I signed it without hesitation.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;From that day on, Ms. Barnes knew about your affair with Amelie. At first, she didn&#x27;t believe me and insulted me with the harshest words.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Later, you couldn&#x27;t control yourself and went to meet Amelie, showing your affection for her publicly. Ms. Barnes saw the truth and realized you were scheming against her company, her everything, even her four sons. Only then did she believe me.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;That&#x27;s when all the plots started, like the money in the billions. Ms. Barnes didn&#x27;t deceive you. She owed that much money. You were the one who was afraid to pay it back, and that&#x27;s how you fell into her trap.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;She still has 600 million dollars left unpaid, and your company is worth about the same amount. Why don&#x27;t you just pay it for her?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jeff&#x27;s body trembled, and his eyes widened in disbelief. A wave of fear immediately spread throughout his body. &quot;What do you mean by that? Six hundred million dollars?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He thought, &quot;Is it true that Paula owed money?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana looked at him, surprised that he believed her lies.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Not only had Paula&#x27;s company not collapsed, but it was thriving. It was something Jeff could never reach.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Diana, speak up! What did you mean by that earlier?&quot; His face was hidden in the shadows; his unsteady body looked even weaker.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana knew his time was up.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The medication he had been taking for Paula had been consumed by him, and soon, he would suffer a stroke, with all his basic needs requiring assistance.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana sneered but said nothing.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jeff panicked, feeling unsteady on his feet.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Grace anxiously held him up.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She had just started enjoying the life of a wealthy woman, and Jeff couldn&#x27;t go bankrupt now.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She was still dreaming of having a son with Jeff to inherit his vast fortune.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She whispered to him, &quot;Jeff, don&#x27;t get so angry. The doctor said your health can&#x27;t handle it. If you get angry, you might faint, and after fainting, you could suffer a stroke.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jeff knew his condition. He furrowed his brows, took a deep breath, suppressed his anger, and looked at Diana. &quot;Diana, you... you&#x27;re really... I never imagined that all my plans would be ruined because of you. You&#x27;re so evil.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Hearing his words made Diana feel exhausted. She sighed and replied, &quot;Mr. Jeff Marsh, who could be more evil than you? You didn&#x27;t even spare your sons, raising them to be useless just to favor an illegitimate child.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Aren&#x27;t you the one who wanted me dead?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jeff choked. That was the decision he regretted the most.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His four sons, no matter how unworthy they were, were still more filial than Queenie.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Especially Gale and Frank, who were very good to him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Dylan was returning soon. He had been calling him, hoping Dylan would stand by him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A father would never harm his child.</p><p style="text-align:left;">If it weren&#x27;t for the manipulation of Queenie and Amelie, how could he have treated his sons like that?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Thinking about how Gale was now disabled, Frank was missing, and Eric&#x27;s career was ruined, he regretted it to the core.</p><p style="text-align:left;">If he had stayed with Paula, he would still be living a privileged life now.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He glared at Diana like a demon from hell. &quot;Diana, just wait! I won&#x27;t let you off.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana sneered. How could he still threaten her at this point? He was addicted to threatening others.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mr. Jeff Marsh, the day Mrs. Foliot went on her trip is the day you&#x27;ll lose everything. I just heard that Mrs. Foliot took her parents on a trip.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jeff was speechless.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He pressed his lips, eyes full of hatred, then quickly left, heading straight for the company.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He wouldn&#x27;t allow anyone to take his company away.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Let&#x27;s go.&quot; Jeff grabbed Grace&#x27;s hand and left.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Grace gave Diana a provocative wink.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana didn&#x27;t say anything.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She shook her head and laughed, thinking, &quot;It won&#x27;t last long before she regrets it.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander watched her smile, feeling a deep ache for her. &quot;Diana, these people must have made you suffer a lot before, haven&#x27;t they?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana shook her head. &quot;No, Alexander. Though there were moments of sadness, it&#x27;s just part of life. My mother made me realize that people closest to you can hurt you without hesitation.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana didn&#x27;t say more, but Alexander knew she must be hurting deeply.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She had been an orphan from childhood. He had been raised abroad since he was young, with no different fate than an orphan. He knew that feeling. Lonely, helpless, always hoping for a mother&#x27;s love, but always disappointed again and again.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A mother, for the sake of power, could abandon her child without hesitation.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His mother was the same.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He had never felt the warmth of family.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander stood up, looked down at her slightly pained expression, and smiled, &quot;Diana, shall we go for a walk?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="1002.html">« Prev</a><a href="1004.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
