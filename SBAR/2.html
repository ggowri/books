If it were in the past, Diana would definitely beg to stay, which would get Jeff to hate her even more. But this time, she actually agreed?!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, please don't sign it. It's all my fault. I took your identity and position, which made you unhappy and attacked&nbsp;me. Diana, I really won't hold you accountable. I forgive you. Please don't leave us, okay?" Queenie squeezed some tears out.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana looked at her teary look, which was the most disgusting fake sympathy she had ever seen.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She let out a relieved chuckle, "Queenie, isn't this exactly what you want? I've agreed to divorce Steven and to leave the Marsh family. Isn't this your dream come true? Or wait, you keep saying you&rsquo;re sorry for taking my place, so why haven&rsquo;t you left if you&rsquo;re truly sorry? You talk big about leaving every time, but you never do. So what's with the tears now?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie choked, realizing that Diana had changed. When did she become so calm and smart?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing that Queenie was speechless, Diana turned to Jeff again. "Mr. Marsh, back then, Steven had a car accident and became blind, so Queenie broke their engagement and fled abroad. You had to bring me back and married me to Steven on her behalf. I agreed to do it because I wanted to&nbsp;repay your kindness in raising me. Well, consider that debt paid in full now."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jeff breathed a sigh of relief after hearing that, for Diana didn't expose the secret they had kept back then. He was almost scared to death when she started talking about the accident years ago.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie also felt relieved.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana took the severance agreement but didn't read it because she had read it in her previous life.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She signed her name without hesitation.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was the biological daughter of the Marsh family but was never acknowledged because she grew up in the countryside and they thought she was not presentable.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Marsh family claimed that she was just an adopted daughter.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There were two copies of the severance agreement. Diana kept one copy for herself, put it in her bag, and sent a message to Tobias Bishop at the same time.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">[Tobias, I want to go home. Queenie from the Marsh family framed me. I want evidence within 20 minutes.]</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She could leave, but before leaving, she had to give Queenie a significant gift.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The guests sitting not far away were still discussing how vicious she was.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana just felt that her heart had become numb from the pain.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She handed the other signed severance agreement to Jeff. "Mr. Marsh, please keep it!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jeff took it and frowned at her cold expression. She didn't care at all, but he felt a little panicked somehow.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana looked at Steven and saw that he was still holding the divorce agreement.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She fainted just now because Steven slapped her twice to avenge Queenie, knocking her unconscious.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It had been three years, and she had almost forgotten that she could have used her combat&nbsp;skills to defend herself. And if she wanted, she could easily kill a grown man.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, you are such an idiot!" she thought.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana accepted the divorce papers from Steven and gazed at his attractive, noble face, a product of his esteemed Capitole lineage. Queenie's relentless pursuit of him was understandable.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She gave a sad smile. She swore this was the last time she felt sad over this man.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Steven, in the past two years, I have taken good care of you. I have never done anything to let you down. I am not guilty."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven was stunned, thinking of her meticulous care f him over the past two years.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Looking at her sad smile, he felt inexplicably irritated.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But she was too vicious and hurt Queenie again and again. He felt sick just by looking at such a nasty woman.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, you'd better keep your word and stop playing games. The last few times I asked for a divorce, you came up with different excuses. And this time, you've gone too far. Because you've taken good care of me these past two years, I'll let it slide this time, for Queenie's sake."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana sneered, and tears streamed down instantly. She felt so much pain. But how could she shed tears for such a scumbag?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You don't need to pity me. You have never loved or trusted me. A scumbag like you is very suitable to be Queenie's lapdog. Since you two love each other so much, I&rsquo;ll do you a favor and get out of your way."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven was enraged and ready to scold Diana when he saw her actually pick up the pen and promptly sign the divorce agreement!</p><div class="pagination"><a href="1.html">« Prev</a><a href="3.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
