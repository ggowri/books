No matter who I follow, I am your daughter. But she is my biological mother. I will always be with you two and take care of you when you grow old."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She maintained a neutral attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She no longer dreamed of a happy family of four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Jeff had Mark's company, he would get richer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But without Mark, Amelie was nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was a scumbag. After Amelie got together with Mark, he had an affair with his assistant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two were living together, but his mistress was after his money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie gave a mocking smile. Her family was rotten to the core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff did not force her. He glanced at Amelie and said, "Amelie, our relationship ends here, and the divorce certificate has been given to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie still refused to let him go. She ran over and grabbed Jeff by the collar, glaring at him and yelling, "Jeff, how can you be so cruel to me? I've been waiting for you for so many years..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff interrupted her painfully, "Yes, I know you have been waiting for me for so many years, so I divorced my wife and married you without hesitation. But how did you treat me? Even the son is not mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelie, you made me a joke, and you made me an incompetent man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Jeff spoke, he pushed Amelie away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her eyes, he was a waste. He would not stay with a woman who cared about money instead of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was thrown to the ground mercilessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She watched Jeff walk away proudly with his back straight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie cried loudly, "It's gone. Everything is gone. Jeff should die. He divorced me. How dare he divorce me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of Mark's property was gone. She had thought that his property would belong to her and her son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, all efforts were in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie had never dreamed that she would end up like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she had known this would happen, she would not have asked Jeff to divorce Paula, whose money could support them for the rest of their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now she was punished for her greediness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie used to have millions of pocket money a month, but now she had nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She used to be spoiled and could buy whatever she wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her children were sweet, and Jeff doted on her. That kind of life was pretty good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, she had no money; she was old and ugly, unable to find someone like Jeff who could provide for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie stood up quickly and endured the pain in the scratches on her palms, taking Queenie's hand and saying, "Queenie, go to see your father. I don't agree to the divorce. If he wants to divorce me, he has to give me half of his property. Otherwise, I will go out and tell everyone that he is ungrateful. I have been his secret mistress for so many years, and he can't treat me like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie looked at the mess in front of her and felt helpless. She broke free from her mother with a glint in her eyes. "Mom, Dad has found a new girlfriend. If you hadn't betrayed Dad, and Noah was his son, you wouldn't have ended up like this. Mom, you can be greedy, but you must not mess around with your children.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Noah was Dad's son, he would dote on you like before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was telling the truth. At least, Jeff would appreciate Amelie's effort over the years. He was angered by her cheating. Noah was not his son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was taken aback, looking at Queenie, who was as selfish and vicious as her father. She was devastated. "When I was pregnant, I didn't know whose child it was. After the child was born, he didn't look like your father, so I sent him abroad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Queenie, you are his daughter. I didn't lie to your father about that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie frowned. At this moment, she wished she was Paula's daughter. In that case, </span><span>she would be the happiest little princess in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was her wishful thinking. It was impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie broke down and yelled, "Mom, stop struggling. You're not married to Mark. His bankruptcy has nothing to do with you. As for Dad, if you want to go back to him, beg him yourself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to spend the New Year with George instead of staying with you. I've brought you some gifts. Ask Noah to stay with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie took George's hand and turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, don't you care about me anymore?" Amelie was feeling uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without money, she felt insecure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie looked back at her. Amelie looked ferocious, and that disgusted Queenie. "Mom, I won't leave you alone. I'll take care of you when you grow old."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apart from that, she couldn't give her mother anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie watched them leave, feeling helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had pinned all her hope on Mark, but Queenie schemed against Jace, and Mark lost everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie collapsed and screamed, unable to accept this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her later years, she should have been wealthy, glorious, and surrounded by sweet children, but now, she had nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily watched the show through binoculars. She filmed everything and sent it to Paula. Following that, she got out of the car and knocked on the door with two bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie thought Queenie had come back to see her, so she quickly opened the door. When she saw Lily, she felt frightened. "Why, it's you. What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily said, "Amelie, Mark lost his company, and your plan failed. You and your son are left with nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My two children treat you as their mom. Please take good care of them. After all, you tricked them to side with you, so you have to look after them till the end. Those two children are nuisances. From now on, enjoy your brilliant life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was taken aback. Thinking of Jean's bad temper, she said angrily, "They are your children. You don't care about them. Why should I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't you treat them as your children before? Why are you saying such things now? Were you pretending to be sincere before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, of course. Which woman can treat other's children as her own? Your children are stupid. I said a few words to please them, and they treated me as their mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They drove away their mother, who treated them so well. Do you blame me for their silliness?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelie, we abandoned our mother for you. It turns out that you pleased us to make our dad divorce our mom so that you could marry him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Jean's sharp voice was heard, Amelie was stunned. She looked at Jean behind Lily. Why did she come?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="945.html">« Prev</a><a href="947.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
