With a smile, he said, "Sir Bishop, I'm not sure if they'll be a perfect match, but I know you're here to boast about your granddaughter's beauty."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, who doesn't have a precious child these days? Diana is our treasure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course, I want her to live well. Now, your boss is asleep. Just hold his hand and sign it. It's his hand that's signing, after all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan was on the verge of tears, suddenly understanding why Steven had fainted. Leopold was a tough nut to crack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sir Bishop, that won't work. Mr. and Mrs. Gellar have already signed the divorce agreement, but they just haven't completed the formalities."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Leopold narrowed his eyes. "Fine, I'll find some people to tie him up and drag him to complete the formalities."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could he suggest such a thing?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sir Bishop, Mr. Gellar has fainted. Please let him be. I'll try to persuade him when he wakes up, okay?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We can't exactly drag an unconscious person down to get divorce. Mr. Gellar might not even make it alive at this rate."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If they actually went through with it, Evan would be in a world of trouble once Steven woke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tell him to finalize the divorce as soon as he wakes up. If he dares to delay any longer, don't blame me for being ruthless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I only recognize Alexander as the right husband for Diana. His grandfather and I get along well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Leopold turned and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan sighed in relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Gellar, are you okay?" Evan called out twice, and Steven awoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan breathed another sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's eyes reddened with emotion. He jumped to his feet as he went to search for Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan could only follow him. Throughout the journey, Steven remained terrifyingly silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan noticed Steven's distress. What on earth was Steven planning to do next?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana might have saved Steven multiple times, but it couldn't hold a candle to the one time Queenie stepped in to save him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alas! Usually, an old flame couldn't outshine new love, but in their tangled web of relationships, the tables had turned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana had all the design drawings ready and was scheduled to meet Alexander that evening. She smiled due to her flourishing career.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was genuinely happy, and when she was busy, she didn't dwell on anything else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Laughing, Diana placed the design drawings in the safe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She sat down, ready for the meeting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The moment she turned on her computer, the door was kicked open.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana frowned. Her gaze chilled over as she realized the person barging in was none other than an enraged Frank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had arrived so quickly. Diana wondered what lies Queenie had been crying about to him this time.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="267.html">« Prev</a><a href="269.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
