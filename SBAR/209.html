She hadn't eaten anything at the banquet and was feeling very hungry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jeff, let's see who ends up going crazy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amusement flashed in Paula's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Starting tonight, she was determined to make Jeff live in immense pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she reached the kitchen, a well-prepared dinner was already set on the table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She sat down to eat, thinking about the night's events. Queenie was always scheming against her daughter, and now that she had climbed up to the Foliot family, she'd likely become even more arrogant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But managing the company had exhausted her, and her four sons were useless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had to take it step by step. Only by securing the company could she protect her children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It didn't matter if they were spoiled; she'd teach them one by one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Gale, that fool, didn't believe her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, this is how it felt to not be trusted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her daughter had endured so much, yet no one was willing to listen to even one word of explanation from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now it was her turn. Her children's distrust made her feel cold all over, with her heart aching sharply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie, you wretched woman, you made me lose my daughter. I will make you lose your whole family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula's eyes were filled with coldness. Halfway through her meal, Jeff returned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Paula, Paula, let me explain. Tonight wasn't what it looked like," Jeff said, looking guilty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at Paula with a face full of guilt. "Paula, I was set up." Sticking to denial was his best move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula's cold eyes fixed on him indifferently. "Jeff, I never thought you'd be interested in women in that setting. You haven't shown any interest in me lately. It's because you've got a mistress outside."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula wasn't angry or upset. After knowing she'd been deceived for over 20 years, she had cried her heart out for one night. Since then, discussing the matter hadn't caused her any pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her gaze was so calm that it made Jeff panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Paula, no, really, I didn't. I was truly set up tonight. After entering, I smelled a faint floral scent, so I wanted to check it out. I didn't know there would be a woman inside."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if you didn't know, you were conscious. If you didn't want to, you wouldn't have been forced. Jeff, starting today, you'll move to the opposite house. You're filthy now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had been dirty for so many years, lingering around her. It was utterly disgusting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Paula..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula looked at his slicked-back hair, greasy face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How had she endured this man for so many years?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps it was because she had been lost in his sweet words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With her status, she had few friends, and regular men treated her only with respect.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only bold men dared to speak sweet words to her. The dullness of life and lack of romantic experiences had made her fall for this man's lies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her tone was very calm. "I don't want my sons to know about this. After all these years, I won't divorce you, but you have to move to the opposite house."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing this, Jeff breathed a sigh of relief. At least there was still room for maneuver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, okay, Paula, I know I've wronged you. I'll move over tonight. From now on, I'll be with you every day. I truly mean it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula laughed angrily. "Truly?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He and that woman had called each other husband and wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To him, she had been nothing but a stepping stone on his path to riches. Tonight was just the beginning of his nightmare. By tomorrow morning, she would make sure he realized that he was the one going crazy.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="208.html">« Prev</a><a href="210.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
