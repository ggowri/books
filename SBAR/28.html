Naturally, I need to reset his bones. If I don&#x27;t fix them within ten minutes, he will be disabled.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Rita felt a slight sense of relief.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In her mind, Cecil had a good personality, but he hated scheming women so much that he treated Diana like this.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She believed after today&#x27;s lesson, Cecil might become wiser.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cecil was stunned, not expecting that his hands could be repaired.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He remained silent, trembling with pain, and stared at Diana.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He could feel the weakness in his hands, and if he became disabled, he would rather die.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana rubbed the bone seam on his wrist with cold and calm eyes. With a click, she reset Cecil&#x27;s hand bones.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Then, she fixed the other hand in the same way.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her skill left everyone astounded.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In their eyes, Diana was simply crazy.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was such a good opportunity. If she had chosen to back down, she could have enjoyed a lifetime of glory and wealth.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But she chose to offend Cecil.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cecil moved his hands. There was some pain, but they had regained strength.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Hold crap. This is incredible. I have strength in my hands again!&quot; Cecil exclaimed, rubbing his painful wrist with surprise, a smile gracing his swollen face.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana stood up coldly and looked at the shocked Queenie. &quot;Queenie, now you should beg Cecil to spare you. After all, he suffered because of you.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie&#x27;s eyes shimmered with murderous intent, and she wished she could tear Diana apart.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She couldn&#x27;t believe this was happening. How could everything be out of her control? Rita wasn&#x27;t supposed to wake up at this time.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Why did things suddenly twist?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Where did Diana find the video?</p><p style="text-align:left;">According to her plan, there was no way Rita would wake up at this time.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After Diana finished speaking, she approached Rita and whispered, &quot;Madam Farley, I apologize for what happened tonight. But if I didn&#x27;t take action, your grandson&#x27;s future could have been even more ruined. We were both poisoned by the same drug. I developed the antidote, and you have the ingredients of the poison. By investigating them, you can find out who bought it. The person behind this wants to seize control of the entire Farley family. As for their identity, you need to investigate yourself.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Rita narrowed her eyes slightly and expressed her gratitude. &quot;Ms. Bishop, thank you so much. If you need any help, please let me know.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana&#x27;s courage had truly impressed Rita.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana smiled. She wanted no further involvement with the Farley family. In the future, the family would fall into the hands of Queenie&#x27;s brother, and Cecil would meet a miserable end.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was only on the day of Cecil&#x27;s death that he would realize that Queenie, whom he had cherished and cared for, was the greatest devil.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Unfortunately, it would be too late by then.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He would only realize how foolish he had been when Queenie disclosed the truth to him at the moment of her killing him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana left indifferently.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As she arrived outside the banquet hall, Steven stood in front of her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana looked at him with a frown.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven said, &quot;Diana, let&#x27;s talk.&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="27.html">« Prev</a><a href="29.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
