He only schemed against others and repaid kindness with enmity. He wouldn't see Diana's efforts.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha..." Queenie laughed. She stared coldly at the wind and snow outside the window with tears in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lost all her money, but Diana and Cecil made a fortune in stocks as if all the good luck was on Diana's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's eyes became more and more gloomy, thinking, "Diana, you can't escape. You are just my stepping stone."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She picked up her phone and sent a message.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Go check where Diana is. Find a few people to teach her a lesson. Remember to send me the photos.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the reply, Queenie put down her phone and went to sleep peacefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Diana, Althea, and Paige finished their lunch, they returned to the hotel. Althea fed the baby, and then they went to the sixth floor to watch a movie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would take them three days to complete all the projects in this building.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They watched a reality-themed movie that had recently been released. It was very touching, and they watched it for two hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing the movie, Diana still had half a bucket of popcorn in her hand. She smiled and said, "I haven't watched a movie for a long time. I was so busy watching it that I even forgot to eat popcorn."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea felt sorry for her. "Before, you were always taking care of Steven and had no time to dress yourself up. But you are still very beautiful without dressing up."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was a little overwhelmed by Althea's praise. It was dinner time, and Paige suggested eating barbecue and going to the spa.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was happy. "Okay, we are here to have fun. We could do whatever we want in these three days."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course. Over the past year, I have been working and learning every day. I will relax myself for these three days." Paige hugged Althea and leaned on her arm. "Althea, I have been very hard during this period."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why she asked them to come out and play together.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Paige had lost a lot of weight, Althea felt sorry for her. "Paige. Diana. You both have lost a lot of weight. You must eat well and don't ruin your body because of a man."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana and Paige were both stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige laughed. "Althea, do we only live for men? I have long forgotten the hurt from Frank. It is a terrifying thing when two people who don't like each other are forced to be together. I understand this now.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will no longer cry because of emotional matters. I'm busy with work, so I've been losing weight slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, let's not talk about men for these three days. Let's just have fun on our own."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them went to the food area while chatting.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far away, under the bright lights, Steven watched the three women leave. He was wearing a black shirt and black pants, which made him look more majestic.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked Evan beside him coldly, "Where are they going now?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="767.html">« Prev</a><a href="769.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
