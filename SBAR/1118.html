Diana wouldn't even call her "Mom" anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back when Diana was willing to call Paula "Mom," Paula never once acknowledged it and constantly criticized her for being uncouth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now that Paula was facing her own punishment, she finally understood how much pain Diana had endured back then.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula let out a bitter laugh. This was the punishment she deserved, but it was excruciating. "Diana, I just wanted to see you. Knowing you're happy with Steven puts my mind at ease."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stared at her intently. Paula's words meant nothing now&mdash;back then, she truly hadn't wanted Diana. "Mrs. Paula Marsh, if there's nothing else, I'll be on my way."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana turned and walked toward the company entrance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven didn</span><span>'</span><span>t spare Paula a single glance and walked away without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula watched their retreating figures, tears streaming uncontrollably down her face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had come today seeking forgiveness, but when she saw Leopold, something about him felt familiar&mdash;like she</span><span>'</span><span>d seen him somewhere before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t shake the feeling that Leopold genuinely cared for Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wondered, puzzled, "Was it really just a whim of Jeff</span><span>'</span><span>s to switch the two children back then?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling uneasy, Paula called her assistant to pick her up and headed straight to the care facility where Jeff was staying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since becoming paralyzed, Jeff had been living in a constant state of misery, wishing for an end.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His hair was nearly all gone, and his mind was barely lucid.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when he saw the radiant Paula, he grew excited, struggling to sit up.</span><span> </span><span>"Paula."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula looked at Jeff's pitiful state and let out a cold laugh. He deserved every bit of this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing him so pathetic only filled her heart with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff was clearly struggling with this life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His hair was almost completely gone, and what little remained had turned white.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was the picture of utter misery.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula demanded, "Jeff, when you swapped Diana and Queenie back then, was it your choice or did someone put you up to it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Leopold earlier suddenly reminded Paula of Diana's biological father.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even after all these years, that man's striking features were still etched vividly in her memory.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff shook his head blankly. "Paula... I don't remember. I was wrong... Please, take me home. Living here is worse than death."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He truly regretted it. This place was pure hell, and he couldn't bear to stay another moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula said coldly, "Jeff, your memory isn</span><span>'</span><span>t that bad. You couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t possibly forget something as big as swapping babies. Tell me the truth about what happened back then, and I</span><span>'</span><span>ll get you a better room."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff was stuck in the worst room of the nursing home. Queenie, trying to save money, had dumped him there to fend for himself. Yet, he stubbornly clung to life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, Jeff wanted a better room. Even a small improvement would make a world of difference.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He deeply regretted it now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t betrayed Paula back then, he</span><span>'</span><span>d be living a free and comfortable life, with Paula buying him new designer suits every season.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff's eyes brimmed with tears. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Paula, I... I really don</span><span>'</span><span>t remember," he stammered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He truly couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t recall the details from back then.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All he remembered was deliberately swapping the two daughters, giving Queenie a life of luxury and wealth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had no other significant memories.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff shook his head in agony, drooling slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Paula, I really can</span><span>'</span><span>t remember. For the sake of our marriage, please help me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula felt a wave of disgust, her heart sinking with disappointment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Coming here had been a complete waste.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you don</span><span>'</span><span>t know, then pretend I was never here. Want a better hospital room? Go ask Queenie," Paula snapped before walking away without looking back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Behind her, only Jeff</span><span>'</span><span>s regretful sobs remained.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Stepping out of the care facility, Paula stood by the roadside, gazing at the blooming tulips across the street.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But a burning question lingered in her heart. She needed to know&mdash;who was Diana</span><span>'</span><span>s real father?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula took a deep breath, got into the car waiting for her, and drove away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment Paula left, Queenie received news that Paula had visited Jeff.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Queenie was in her office, celebrating the acquisition of the King Group with Mario.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a surprise gift from Mario, and Queenie couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t be happier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were tangled in a heated embrace, passion filling the office.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie leaned against Mario's chest, her expression darkening as she read the message from the care facility.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Does Jeff still have any value to us? Why would Paula go see him?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario swirled his glass of red wine, downed the rest in one gulp, and murmured, "Probably something else."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie let it go and turned her gaze to Mario. Seeing his satisfied expression, she couldn't help but ask, "Has Steven been investigating our company?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Steven's level of caution, he</span><span>'</span><span>s bound to dig into who acquired the King Group.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario let out a cold laugh, his tone dripping with arrogance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, Steven's been swamped with meetings since he got back. He doesn</span><span>'</span><span>t have time for this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides, a small company like the King Group isn</span><span>'</span><span>t even on his radar. He wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t bother investigating. Our people say the couple</span><span>'</span><span>s been really busy lately. But here</span><span>'</span><span>s some good news&mdash;Alexander went to see Diana today."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander has feelings for Diana."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jealousy burned fiercely in Queenie</span><span>'</span><span>s heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought bitterly, "Even Alexander has a thing for Diana. She</span><span>'</span><span>s ridiculously lucky."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her good mood vanished instantly. Queenie snapped, "Is Dylan's friend all set up?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was determined to destroy Diana completely. There was no way she</span><span>'</span><span>d let Diana be happier than her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario thought of those greedy fools and sneered. "Once they take care of Diana, we</span><span>'</span><span>ll send them in to keep Dylan company."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I</span><span>'</span><span>ve already given them instructions, but they just can</span><span>'</span><span>t seem to find the right opportunity."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie stood up and said, "Let</span><span>'</span><span>s go. You</span><span>'</span><span>re coming with me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario asked, "Where to?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie flashed a wicked smile. "You</span><span>'</span><span>ll find out soon enough."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario didn</span><span>'</span><span>t press further and followed her out...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That afternoon, Steven and Diana returned to the Gellar Manor. As they reached the door, bursts of laughter echoed from inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They exchanged a glance. Diana frowned in confusion, "Since when were they this close?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had no idea Leopold already knew Edward and Helen&mdash;and had even schemed something with them behind the scenes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven shook his head, signaling he was just as clueless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana snapped, frustration bubbling up. "Steven, did you never bother to dig for the truth back then?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven frowned, his voice low. "Diana, back then, I was barely surviving. I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t have the luxury to chase the truth."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1117.html">« Prev</a><a href="1119.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
