There was something charmingly innocent about her, untouched by the complexities of romance.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Just then, Diana&#x27;s phone buzzed. She glanced at it and saw that the cake she ordered had arrived.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Standing up, she said, &quot;Mr. Gellar, you can go ahead. I have something to take care of.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Hearing her formal address felt strange to him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">When she used his name, it didn&#x27;t bother him, but hearing her be so distant made him frown.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Where are you taking the baby?&quot; he asked as he rose.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I ordered a small cake and I want to pick it up. It&#x27;ll be here any minute, so you can go do your thing.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The cake could only be delivered to the lobby, not the top floor.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Wait here. I&#x27;ll get it for you,&quot; Steven offered.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;No, no, no, it&#x27;s fine. I&#x27;ll get it myself,&quot; Diana insisted, grabbing her bag and hugging Harlan as she headed out.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He felt a surge of frustration. &quot;Diana, why do you insist on opposing me like this?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">As she reached the door, she turned back, giving him a bemused look. &quot;You&#x27;re really impossible. I&#x27;m not bothering you. I just don&#x27;t want your help.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He scoffed, &quot;But I&#x27;m your husband.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She retorted coldly, &quot;You didn&#x27;t act like my husband when I needed you. Now that I don&#x27;t need you, you want to play that role again? It&#x27;s too late for that.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">With that, she turned and walked out, leaving him feeling helpless and a bit heartbroken.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven thought back to the times he hadn&#x27;t trusted Diana, and a wave of sadness washed over him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It hurt to realize that the person he cared for didn&#x27;t believe in him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He followed her downstairs in silence, pressing the elevator button for her without a word.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana assumed he was going down for work and didn&#x27;t question it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She had her period and was craving sweets, so she&#x27;d ordered takeout.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Like many girls, she had those days each month when all she wanted was dessert.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But when they reached the first floor, Steven took the delivery bag from the delivery guy without hesitation.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana looked at him, puzzled. &quot;Aren&#x27;t you supposed to be working?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven smiled lightly, &quot;Didn&#x27;t I just say I finished my work? I just want to spend time with you. It&#x27;s not easy to carry the baby, so I followed you to get the takeout. Are you getting it now?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Realization dawned on her, and her cheeks flushed. &quot;Sorry, I misunderstood.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">As a chilly breeze swept through the lobby, Diana instinctively turned to head back inside, concerned about the baby getting cold.</p><p style="text-align:left;">While waiting for the elevator, she suddenly spotted a familiar figure and instinctively pulled Steven into a nearby corner.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;What&#x27;s wrong? Who did you see?&quot; he asked, his voice low.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Shh! Just be quiet,&quot; she whispered urgently, her eyes focused ahead.</p><p style="text-align:left;">At the elevator entrance stood two familiar faces.</p><p style="text-align:left;">They were Amelie and her lover, Mark.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="790.html">« Prev</a><a href="792.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
