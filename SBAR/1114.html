He had waited for every man around Queenie to fall, just for this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the mask, he let out a mocking smile and said coldly, "Yvette, your pathetic look truly amuses me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvette wanted to know who he was, but with the voice changer and the mask covering his face, she had no way of guessing his identity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario walked closer, his eyes fixed on her beautiful face. She was stunning, but her actions were despicable. Yvette</span><span>'</span><span>s family deals relied on her sleeping with countless men.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario slapped her hard across the face, and tears streamed down Yvette's cheeks from the pain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "Who the hell is this bastard to dare treat me like this?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though her face stung with pain, she still felt a sense of unreality. It was as if being dragged here was just a bad dream.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvette sobbed loudly, pleading with Mario to rip off the black tape. But Mario had no interest in hearing her voice.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He walked over and grabbed her chin, his grip firm. His eyes drifted to her legs, and he chuckled. "Yvette, you</span><span>'</span><span>re shameless. Stealing my business? You</span><span>'</span><span>re just asking for trouble."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"All your business comes from selling your body," he sneered. "I've been following you, taking plenty of photos and videos. The moment I release those, your family is done for."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the mask, Mario wore a wicked smile. That greedy expression sent a chill down Yvette's spine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Such a shame," Mario said, his tone dripping with mockery. "You're so beautiful, yet your private life is so filthy. Even the ugliest men have been with you. And as for the King family, they</span><span>'</span><span>re mine." He waved his hand, and a few burly men stepped into the room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario let out a cold laugh. "Yvette, I heard you enjoy being with multiple men at once. The ones I</span><span>'</span><span>ve brought for you are top-notch. Enjoy yourself." He leaned in closer, his voice dripping with malice. "In three minutes, everything you</span><span>'</span><span>ve done will be exposed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvette couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t understand who she had offended.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With George captured, everything now rested on her shoulders.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Business was tough these days, especially with Steven</span><span>'</span><span>s immense power. Landing big contracts was nearly impossible. If she wanted to grow the King family, she had to seek partnerships everywhere.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had followed George back then, and through Owen</span><span>'</span><span>s introduction, tried to seduce Steven&mdash;all because she still had hope in George.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If George had won, the King family </span><span>could</span><span>'</span><span>ve </span><span>risen even higher. But he lost. Now, she could only rely on herself. She had to hold onto the business she had now&mdash;no one else could take it from her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tonight</span><span>'</span><span>s deal was the one she was most satisfied with. She had spent three days entertaining the client. But she never expected the deal to be stolen, and worse, to be dragged here and held hostage. Now, she was at the mercy of these disgusting people.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvette's voice was drowned out by the disgusting laughter of several men.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked toward the door, pleading for help. But at this moment, no one was coming to save her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they really released those videos, those men</span><span>'</span><span>s wives would definitely find a way to kill her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvette was just a woman who wanted to survive. She had relied on her own skills and abilities to get where she was today. What was her crime?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if she was wrong, it wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t their place to hurt her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the dark basement, only Yvette's anguished cries echoed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario stood outside, listening to her screams, his expression cold. "Queenie, she seduced George back then. I've avenged you now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario texted his assistant, instructing him to upload Yvette</span><span>'</span><span>s video online and start preparing to acquire the King family</span><span>'</span><span>s company.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After arranging everything, Mario went home.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Diana woke up, it was a rainy, gloomy day outside. She hated the cold. As a chill crept in, she pulled the blanket tighter around herself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she stretched, her fist accidentally landed on Steven's face. Diana froze for a moment, then quickly turned to her side. She saw Steven lying next to her, now wide awake from the hit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her with a smile. "Good morning, darling!" His voice was deep and sexy, making Diana blush.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She sat up abruptly, staring at Steven. "What are you doing..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven cut her off with a grin. "Sweetheart, you promised to give me a chance. You can</span><span>'</span><span>t back out now. We</span><span>'</span><span>re married, and the first step to giving me a chance is sharing a room. Or do you want Grandpa and Grandma to find out we</span><span>'</span><span>re sleeping in separate beds?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought, "He</span><span>'</span><span>s full of excuses. On this island, in such a huge villa, only one room has a bed&mdash;clearly his deliberate arrangement. And now he</span><span>'</span><span>s using his grandparents as an excuse."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She smiled faintly. "Steven, since when did you become so good at these little tricks?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven raised an eyebrow. "Diana, you</span><span>'</span><span>re the one who told me&mdash;whether it</span><span>'</span><span>s chasing a man or a woman, you need a bit of strategy. I</span><span>'</span><span>m just doing exactly what you taught me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana froze. When had she ever said something like that?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She just let out a cold snort at him before getting out of bed to wash up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven watched her back, a carefree, charming smile playing on his lips. His gentle face reflected softly in the window glass.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Diana let out a startled scream. Steven didn</span><span>'</span><span>t even bother putting on his shoes and rushed to the bathroom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, what</span><span>'</span><span>s wrong?" Steven asked, his voice tight with concern as he looked at her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stared at the pink pajamas she was wearing, completely stunned. She whipped her head toward Steven. "How did I fall asleep last night?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her last memory of last night was on the couch, and then everything went blank.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So it was about the pajamas. Steven let out a quiet sigh of relief and said hoarsely, "Diana, you spent the whole day in the lab yesterday. You smelled like chemicals. After you fell asleep, I changed your clothes for you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then he added, "We</span><span>'</span><span>re married."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana pointed at herself and asked, "When did I fall asleep?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven glanced at her silently. She slept so well, she could probably fall asleep while walking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gestured to his own arms. "On the way upstairs, you almost tripped. You fell asleep in my arms."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana blinked, accepting his explanation. She really was exhausted yesterday.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She shot him a quiet glance. A question lingered in her mind&mdash;why did she feel </span><span>safe enough to fall asleep while climbing the stairs?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1113.html">« Prev</a><a href="1115.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
