He advanced, pressing her against the wall with an unyielding force, leaving her with no escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lowering his head, he captured her lips with a possessive bite before whispering into her ear, "Diana, Queenie betrayed me. Do you think I'll treat her the same way as before? Everything she took from me, I will reclaim, piece by piece. I have never been a good man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was rendered speechless. How could he have the audacity to say such a thing? "Steven, you thought she saved you and lavished her with the best in the world. Now, you think she deceived you and wants to take everything back. Is your kindness and love for others merely because they saved your life?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about firefighters? Every single day, they're out there saving thousands of lives."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's different, Diana," he countered. "That fire wasn't just a fire. It was murder."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shuddered at the word. Murder? She had always believed it was an accident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never delved deeply into why Jeff and Queenie had been there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do you know it was a murder? Why did Jeff and Queenie appear there? That day, I had something to do there, and my eldest brother was having an open-air barbecue, so I went there," Diana voiced the question that had been gnawing at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven recalled waking up in the hospital with Jeff and Queenie by his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hint of murderous intent flashed across his gaze. "I woke up in the hospital with Jeff and Queenie right there beside me. Jeff insisted it was Queenie who pulled me from the flames. At the time, I believed him without question. But then, your grandfather visited me. He told me it was you who saved me from that inferno. I had to know the truth, so I sent people to dig into it, but all the evidence had been wiped clean. Jeff and Queenie were my best leads. Someone had planned this to kill me, and they almost got away with it. But you were there. You saved my life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They exploited the chaos, manipulating Queenie into posing as my savior. They knew full well how much I cherish friendship and loyalty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop it," Diana interrupted with a sneer. "I've been with you for two years, and I don't think you're loyal. Don't use those words to define yourself. You don't deserve them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven merely smiled casually, acknowledging her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand traced her face, his gaze penetrating her slightly flustered eyes. She was still afraid of him. "Diana, I was wrong. I have caused irreversible harm to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana recoiled from his gentle tone and pushed him away fiercely. "Steven, the damage is done. In this life, I won't forgive you just because you're sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eyes caught the light with a predatory glint, his face twisting into an expression that toyed with her like a cat with its prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, I will make you forgive me one day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't call me that!" Diana warned coldly. How could he have the nerve to do that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before, you had the audacity to say I was unworthy. Now, I'm throwing those words right back at you, Steven. Are you worthy? No, you are not!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven gaped at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of anger raged in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain and anger overwhelmed his reason, making him want to strangle her neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he met her calm gaze, his bravado deflated like a punctured balloon. He remembered how, when he had hurled those harsh words at her once before, she had crumbled into tears.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="815.html">« Prev</a><a href="817.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
