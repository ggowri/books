It turned out that they were so evil.

Queenie would torture a proud man like Yanson slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She loved no one but herself, and everyone around her would be a stepping stone to her ascent to power.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yanson, if you didn't catch it, I'll repeat it. All cooperation between the Hastings family and me is terminated," Steven said word by word, his eyes deep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson didn't quite understand what went wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had humiliated Diana in the same way before, but Steven had never blamed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, for Diana, his decision to break with the Hastings family was serious.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson gazed at Steven intently, ignoring the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Steven strode away to chase Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie fixed her eyes on his back with sarcasm, wondering if Steven finally realized that he was wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, it was too late. Queenie found herself so amazing that everyone focused on her and spoke up for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana no longer loved Steven and would never forgive him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was aware that Steven's two friends, Owen and Yanson, were both fond of her, so they would always protect her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought she was really outstanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yanson, are you in pain?

Yanson couldn't accept it. Over the years, thanks to Steven, he had managed to expand the family business.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson slowly stood up and looked at Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said that Queenie was a thief!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before returning to the country, he heard from Owen about what had happened between Diana and Steven. She eventually signed a divorce agreement with Steven in a kidnapping staged by Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Assuming that Queenie orchestrated the kidnapping because of her desire to marry Steven, Yanson was still willing to believe that she was kind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He came back recently and actually knew about her family affairs. However, he couldn't change his habit of protecting her and bullying Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damn Diana, if she hadn't appeared, nothing would have happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yanson, thank you for protecting me. I am sorry that you fell out with Steven because of me." Queenie pretended to be guilty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she added, "Diana is just a troublemaker. As long as she is present, everyone will be unhappy. Yanson, don't be angry. Steven is furious now. Once he calms down, everything will be fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson ignored her and turned away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's kick was very powerful, and he endured the pain and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie gazed at his back and sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Paige was probably going to freeze to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And next, Queenie would have her moment of glory.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She walked towards the press gracefully and elegantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zion was waiting for her over there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trending topic about Queenie winning the 24th Fashion Cup was orchestrated by him to whitewash her and amplify her excellence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All her outstanding achievements, including her great academic performance, her piano awards, and her design awards, were brought to light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She became completely famous on this day.
