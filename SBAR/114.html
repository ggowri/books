But the sun seemed unable to warm him, and he was still very cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing someone sitting opposite him, Steven withdrew his gaze and looked at Tobias.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He sat upright, looking domineering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Compared with Steven, Tobias was more gentle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tobias spoke first, "Steven, you used to be Diana's beloved, but now she doesn't love you anymore. Let the past be the past. And you should both start a new life. I hope you take the initiative to get a divorce and stop hurting her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tobias' words hurt Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone was advising him to divorce Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Who are you to her?" Steven asked indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tobias said, "I am her unrelated brother. A few years ago, she fell in love with you. The Marsh family is her real family. Even if she is bullied, I can do nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Now that she has given up and returned to me, I will not let anyone bully her, including you, Steven."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sorry." Steven didn't know what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven only felt that he was a jerk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana had loved him for so many years, but he always thought that she was ignorant. In fact, it was Queenie who had been hurting Diana in another way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tobias said, "Diana doesn't need your apology. She just wants you to divorce her and stay away from her. She has nightmares at night and screams. She is afraid of you hurting her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"She's afraid of you, even in her dreams. Do you understand?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tobias stood up and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven punched the table, breaking his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana and his two companions played on the island for three days before returning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After another day of rest, she went to work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">During these days on the island, she drew a lot of designs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana came to the company today to look at fabric samples.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She asked Luna to get ready early in the morning. And after the examination, she planned to go to the beauty salon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She played at the beach these days and got a tan, so she made an appointment with Olivia to get a beauty treatment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Diana arrived downstairs at the company, she got out of the car. She looked pretty in the morning light.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana heard the familiar voice and felt annoyed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She turned to look at Gale. He was wearing a baseball uniform and a baseball cap, and looked at her with cold eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Gale Marsh, what's wrong?" Diana asked indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He said, "What did you do to Queenie? She has been unhappy these past few days. Come back with me and apologize to her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana interrupted him angrily, "Why are you looking for me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Go back and apologize to her. After all, it was you who stole Steven, so she is unhappy." Gale was firm in his attitude.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana took a deep breath and wondered why she knew such an idiot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She felt tired.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Get out!" Diana roared angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale was stunned and surprised. "Diana, you told me to get out? You are a junior high school graduate, but you came here to be the design director. You just want to seduce Mr. Watson. You have done such a disgusting thing, why do you still occupy Steven?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale looked at Diana with sharp eyes and contempt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana laughed angrily, "You should go to Steven. He was the one who refused to divorce. Also, Nolan is not like you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale didn't understand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, what do you mean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana said, "It's very simple. Although Nolan is young, he is very talented and a rising star. His achievements in recent years are not achieved by hooking up with women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Besides, you only have Queenie in your eyes. You have never understood what kind of person I am. I live well just by seducing men? I have the benefit just by using any means to gain it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Gale, you are disgusting. Not only are you stupid, you are also garbage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Think carefully about what happened half a year ago. Who schemed against you?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="113.html">« Prev</a><a href="115.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
