Let's just wait for Diana to fish for us. Getting bitten by a moray eel would be no joke."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige was also scared; she was really frightened just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Farley, for safety, let's go fishing on the boat instead. I almost got bitten in the face by an eel that jumped out of the water just now. It was so scary, let's get back to the boat quickly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige was frightened, looking at Cecil with tears in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon seeing her teary face, Cecil felt that she was quite pitiful, so he said, "Alright, alright, let's get on the boat. I also find it very scary."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two men carried the lobsters onto the boat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan shook his head with a helpless smile because they were scared by a single conger eel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan really enjoys fishing. He stood leisurely by the seaside, casting his line. Not long after, he got a bite and happily reeled in the fish. Upon seeing that it was a grouper, he smiled with joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He felt that it would be truly wonderful if he could come here to relax once a month.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the past two years, even getting a good night's sleep has become a luxury for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven, on the other hand, had been swimming in the sea all along.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Watching Diana pull in fish one by one, he waited beside her for the fish to be hauled up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Steven felt a level of relaxation like never before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He hadn't felt this relaxed in a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Coming here was the right choice. At least he no longer had to be on high alert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana surfaced, holding a large squid in her hand, "Steven, quick, this squid is huge."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing the abundance of seafood, Diana was so excited that she even forgot her dislike for Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She came out to relax, not to argue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven looked at her rosy face and smiled, "Diana, do you want to take a break?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shook her head. "No, I've spotted a lobster den. Let me catch these few first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After speaking, Diana dived back into the water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven couldn't help but laugh as he watched her joyful figure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he watched her cheerful figure, he couldn't help but become gentle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana dived for three hours and finally got tired.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She got out of the water, looked at the dozen or so sea creatures, turned to Steven behind her and said, "Steven, I'll sell you ten of these. Remember to transfer me one million dollars."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana took off her glasses, revealing faint red marks on her eyes. Steven frowned and said, "Alright! When we get back, I'll have Evan transfer the money to you, plus an extra hundred thousand dollars. You're in charge of dinner tonight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was great to have money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She said happily, "Okay, I'll take care of preparing dinner. Now, I'm going to take a bath and rest for a while; we still have to go fishing again tonight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana boarded the boat with a light step.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven watched her back, then looked at his injured arm, his gaze darkening. She really didn't care about him anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the past, even if his finger was just slightly scratched, she would be worried for a long time and use the best medicine on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, Diana, knowing full well that the wound on his arm is deep, doesn't even spare it a glance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven sat on the beach basking in the sun, his gaze somewhat deep as he looked into the distance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan, noticing that Steven was in a bad mood, did not disturb him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the afternoon, the chefs brought by Cecil cooked a lot of delicious food, including grilled, boiled and steamed ones, and every kind of seafood was very delicious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven and Evan also boarded the boat to eat together.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="407.html">« Prev</a><a href="409.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
