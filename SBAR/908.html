"Mr. Gellar, I'll return the favor. What's yours is yours, but if it's not, don't dwell on it. You might end up losing sleep over nightmares!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew glared at her for a moment before storming off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He </span><span>did</span><span>n't </span><span>understand why Diana dared to</span><span> demand everything from the Gellar family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they were gone, Helen sank into the sofa, feeling a wave of discomfort wash over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she remembered the stipulations of the agreement. It wouldn't be settled quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the assets falling into Diana's hands had been orchestrated by Steven behind the scenes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Helen." Diana looked at Helen with concern, noticing how much older she seemed, her once straight back now slightly hunched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, Olivia, that brat came today..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Helen, I know," Diana quickly interrupted, wary of eavesdroppers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen sighed in relief at Diana's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused, "I found it strange. Just the other day, Steven was asking for Diana's forgiveness after the accident, and now he's suddenly set on marrying that crazy woman, Queenie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streamed down Helen's face as disbelief washed over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could a single accident lead to Steven being replaced by someone else?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Olivia hadn't asked what was going on, she pieced together the situation after listening for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused, "No wonder! I thought my divination skills had taken a hit, but now it all makes sense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. I'll do a reading for Steven," Olivia offered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, Helen nodded eagerly. "Olivia, I know your abilities. Please, figure it out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice dropped to a whisper, "I just hope Evan is still alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Helen. As of now, he should be fine," Olivia reassured her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sigh of relief escaped Helen. Evan had grown up alongside Steven, and if anything happened to him, Steven would be devastated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had shared countless sleepless nights, and Evan would break his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan must be okay. She virtually regarded him as her grandson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Andrew and the others exited the Gellar Manor, Andrew stormed over to Queenie, fury radiating from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, it's all your fault. You're a disaster waiting to happen! Were you so eager? You knew about the agreement, yet you still pushed George to get a divorce."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a swift motion, Andrew slapped Queenie across the face, and the sound echoed in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seething with rage, Queenie shot back. "I knew about the agreement, but I didn't know if it was real or not. I thought it was a bluff. No matter what, Steven is the rightful heir of the Gellar family, and everything should go to him. I didn't expect it to happen so fast! Why are you blaming me? You knew about the agreement, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What gives you the right to hit me? Just because you're incapable doesn't mean you can take it out on me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears of frustration welled in Queenie's eyes. It felt like they were ganging up on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time something went wrong, it was always her fault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what Queenie didn't know was that things were about to get much worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George stood there. His expression was gloomy and his lips were pressed. He possessed the same commanding presence as Steven, exuding an aura of power with every movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snapped, "Shut up! Both of you, just shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew and Queenie were both startled at his sudden outburst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a chilling smile, George turned to Andrew. "Dad, you've exposed me without any plan in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven's car went off the cliff, and he didn't stand a chance. And now, I'm left with nothing because that Helen handed everything over to Diana."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smirked. "George, we can force Diana to give everything back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George slapped her across the face. "Are you an idiot? How do you expect to take anything from her? Does Diana even have a weakness?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does she? She's already turned her back on the Marsh family. What could threaten her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's disbelief was palpable, but she couldn't shake off the sting of his slap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"George, you hit me!" Tears welled up in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold laugh, George replied, "Queenie, I warned you not to lose Paula's support. Your four brothers could easily take down Diana if they teamed up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what good would that do against Diana? You already have Steven's identity. With that, you could secure tons of investments and partnerships. In less than two years, you'd be firmly established in Capitole. What more do you want?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, Diana, even Madam Gellar and Sir Gellar can't touch your position now. Your dad still has Madam Gellar's company, and you have plenty of connections, plus your own business. Can't you manage on your own?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you hitting me? Why are you blaming me? I've loved you since I was seventeen, devoted myself to you. You wanted me to distract Steven, and I did just that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've done everything you asked over the years, stealing countless secrets for you. Thanks to that, your business abroad has thrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it weren't for the confidential information I provided, you wouldn't be where you are today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"George, why did you hit me? You can be angry and shout at me, but I can't accept you hitting me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fuming, Queenie turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the swirling snow, her figure appeared incredibly alone and filled with her deep sorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching her fragile silhouette, George felt a pang of regret. Queenie understood him better than anyone, and he quickly ran after her. They were each other's anchors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, I'm sorry. I messed up. Please don't be angry." He grasped her hand tightly, pulling her into his embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie leaned against him, sobbing uncontrollably. "Wah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George gently patted her back, speaking softly to soothe her, "It's okay, Queenie. Please stop crying. I was wrong. You can hit me if it'll make you feel better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he took her hand and slapped his face twice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's heart ached as she caressed his cheek, tears shimmering in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"George, don't do that anymore. I forgive you. Please don't hurt yourself. We'll find a way to get back what Diana took from us. She doesn't know anything about running a company. If her business fails, it'll become ours. Trust me, she's clueless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George smiled gently. His hand brushed her cold face, feeling a surge of compassion, "Alright! I believe you. I don't blame you. I was just so anxious that I took it out on you."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="907.html">« Prev</a><a href="909.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
