She had already asked Luna to sign up and went over to keep an eye on Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna was also a racing driver, but she didn't compete often.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana couldn't miss the opportunity with Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the day of the competition, she was still drawing the design drafts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After crying once, she suddenly had endless inspiration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By the afternoon, Diana had completed twenty-five designs, each of which she was pleased with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She stood up and stretched her arms. She had been sitting for several days, and her whole body was sore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she was in a good mood, smiling brightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana slept in the office for the past three days. This time, she was so careful that she even locked the design drawings in the safe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She yawned and walked towards the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was forty minutes later when Diana came out of the shower.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was about to go home to rest but received a call from the police. </p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why did the police contact her? She answered the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Excuse me, are you Diana Bishop?" A serious voice came from the other end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana replied, "Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Gale's car slid off the track during the race, and he was seriously injured. His legs were severely deformed. The technicians found that his car had been tampered with, but he claimed that you were the culprit. Ms. Bishop, please come and cooperate with the investigation. Because you two had a lot of conflicts, the first person he suspected was you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana laughed angrily. How could it be? She didn't remember this part in her previous life. How could she be set up as the culprit? Queenie and Jeff were pretty cruel and cunning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The police reached her because they had evidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana frowned. This matter was a bit tricky. Queenie was really scheming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana asked, "Where should I go?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The police said, "Come to the hospital now. Gale has been sent to the hospital near the race track."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana replied, "Okay! I'll be there right away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hung up and went downstairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie and Jeff came to watch Gale's competition and sent him to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a lengthy two-hour examination, doctors announced that Gale had broken both legs and that even if he recovered, it was impossible for him to race the car again. During follow-up treatment, he would be confined to a wheelchair for up to three years. Whether he could stand up or not was another matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale almost fainted hearing the news. A large scratch was still on his forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale realized that he was disabled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He closed his eyes dejectedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since it was the right time, Queenie added fuel to the fire, saying, "Gale, take a good rest and stop overthinking. The vicious woman, Diana, will meet her doom."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff said, "Gale, listen to me. Get treatment with peace of mind. I just asked the doctors. As long as you actively cooperate with the treatment, there is hope that you can stand up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I have already got in touch with a foreign expert. After your first surgery, I will send you abroad to recuperate. You will definitely be able to stand up in three years."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale closed her eyes. Diana's warning him not to participate in the competition crossed his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It turned out that she really intended to harm him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he remembered the recording Paula had played, and he instantly became irritated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was it Queenie or Diana?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He opened his eyes in anger, gazed at Jeff, and asked impatiently, "Where is Diana? I want to see her and ask her why she harmed me."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="224.html">« Prev</a><a href="226.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
