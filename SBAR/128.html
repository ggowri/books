Besides, she had completely given up on Steven. Now when she mentioned this matter again, her mood didn't fluctuate much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In this life, she would never give Steven the chance to hurt her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Okay, let's go. "</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana drove there herself. There was no traffic jam at night, and she arrived at his destination in half an hour.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the past, Diana rarely had time to go shopping at night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After finishing the day's work, she still had to prepare dinner for Steven and clean the house. Now that she thought these past few years had been frustrating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She lived a carefree life now. After getting out of the car, she looked at the buildings in the distance. The neon lights were flashing, and the colorful lights intertwined to create a strong sense of prosperity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She took a deep breath. She worked hard for her life, but Steven turned a blind eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now, she no longer had to work hard for their future, it was so relaxing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing Olivia getting out of the car, Diana calmed down. She walked over and took Olivia's hand, saying, "Come on, Olivia, let's go in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Olivia looked at the name of the mall and was confused. "Diana, why is this place called October Mall?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana smiled and said, "Because this is a mall owned by Steven, and Queenie was born on October 1st, so it's called October Mall."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Olivia stopped abruptly. She said apologetically, "Diana, I'm sorry. We shouldn't have come here. Let's go to another one."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana looked at her with amusement and said, "Why? We are here to spend money, not to do anything else. No need to change."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm afraid you'll be sad," Olivia said frankly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana shook her head and said, "I won't be sad, Olivia. People who are confused by love are fools, and fools are hopeless. So, I don't want to be a fool. Now I know what I want, and I am not living in confusion. I am now working hard to make myself richer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Olivia understood what she meant, and she pulled her inside. "Great, if you can't hold the sand, you might as well throw it away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yeah!" Diana smiled with relief, and the two took the elevator up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But they didn't notice that there was a tall figure following them.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="127.html">« Prev</a><a href="129.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
