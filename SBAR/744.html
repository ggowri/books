"Owen, you need to learn some respect. Don't speak badly of Diana again. She's remarkable. You don't know her, but you'll see it in time."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had always ignored Diana, never truly taking the time to understand her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, after finally setting aside his prejudices and genuinely getting to know her, he realized just how exceptional she was.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, the once-admirable Queenie had now become someone he found utterly repellent.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen noted the seriousness in his eyes and chuckled. "I haven't spent much time around her. Whether she's impressive or not has nothing to do with me. But since you're asking, I'll lay off."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven knew Owen could be stubborn in some areas. As long as he kept his hurtful comments to himself, that was enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good. And one more thing, Queenie's child isn't mine. I've done what I owe her. Keep my move here to yourself, and don't come here for work matters. I don't want anyone disturbing my life with Diana."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a blunt dismissal.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen's expression shifted slightly, and he gave Steven a long look before quietly leaving with a faint smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven turned and headed to the kitchen, planning to help Diana with dinner once she came downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hunger had already driven Diana down in her loungewear, ready to start cooking.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Steven there, she looked a bit surprised. "What are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven shifted awkwardly under her curious gaze. "I thought I'd help with dinner. Just tell me what you're making."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana gave him a strange look.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She laughed, asking, "Are you serious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven nodded. "Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just wanted to lend a hand. But when he saw her dismissive glance, he sensed she might reject his offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, Diana turned him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just leave. It's only the two of us, so it won't take long. I'm making ribs for you tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She waved him out of the kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not wanting to annoy her by insisting, Steven quietly stepped back, standing nearby as he watched her busy herself in the kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana slipped on a pink apron and set to work.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took out the ribs, washed and blanched them, then set them to simmer with spices.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While that cooked, she washed the vegetables, made two side dishes, and even started a soup.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her movements were swift and sure.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven suddenly realized how captivating every motion was, and a small smile crept onto his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After about forty minutes, Diana glanced back to see Steven still standing there. She thought to herself, "So stubborn."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't like him. Steven had never been one to step into the kitchen. He wouldn't even get his own water. She'd always taken care of it for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once, she'd been willing to do anything for the man she loved, but later, she learned he didn't actually need her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dinner's ready," she called, turning back to look at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven answered, "Alright!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped in to help set the table, and soon, they were eating together.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The food was comfortingly familiar, and Steven found himself eating a lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, he looked over at Diana and realized she truly wasn't as focused on him anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, whenever they ate together, Diana never looked at her phone, cherishing every moment with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she scrolled through her messages as she ate.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't seem to care if he'd had enough at all.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="743.html">« Prev</a><a href="745.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
