"Eric, why did Mom cut ties with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric sighed, "Because I can only spend money and not make any. To her, I'm a loser. Mom's company is in crisis, and she can't afford to give me any money right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I went to her this morning asking for some, but she refused and said some harsh things. I told her that you're an actress and that I needed to send you a million dollars a month for living expenses so you wouldn't get bullied on set."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, I had a fight with Mom because of you, and now she's severed ties with me. Maybe she doesn't want us to be burdened with this massive debt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The situation at her company is getting worse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie frowned, realizing how precarious Paula's company was. Now would be the perfect time to buy it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eric, I've invested all my money. Once I start making a profit, I promise to repay you. Okay? You love me the most. Ple</span><span>ase.</span><span>" Queenie said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric replied, "Yes, I love you the most, Queenie</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>B</span><span>ut I don't have much left. I need to support myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, she's not planning to pay me back?" Eric thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie continued, "Eric, our family finances are tight. Why don't you look for a job? Racing cars and motorcycles cost millions a month. If you don't have the money, you can't keep up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric was momentarily stunned, then he recalled that it was Queenie who had suggested he and Gale take up racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the time, Paula had been against it, saying it was dangerous and could lead to serious accidents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Queenie had insisted, "Oh, Mom, you don't understand. Guys on motorcycles are dashing. Gale and Eric both love racing. The men in our Marsh family are so cool!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, Eric and the others had been thrilled, grateful that their parents supported their dreams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he realized that Queenie had pushed them towards racing because she hoped something bad would happen to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale had already been in a serious accident once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric deliberately relaxed his tone, saying, "Queenie, you've taken 40 million in my name. I'm a little short right now. You have to help me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smiled. "Eric, I'll have my assistant transfer you 100 thousand dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric was very surprised. "That's it? I've treated you well, and this is how you repay me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie played the victim. "Eric, Steven used to give me pocket money every month, but after Diana found out, she threatened him. Now he won't give me anything, and I'm feeling the pinch. It's all Diana's fault."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Eric listened, tears filled his eyes. He had trusted Queenie's words and had lashed out at Diana without thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric was really foolish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression darkened, and coldness filled his eyes. "Don't worry, Queenie. I'll deal with her. She's just a worthless village girl. She's nothing compared to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie said, "Eric, even though Diana can be nasty, you shouldn't be too harsh on her. Frank was too cruel to her and ended up being punished. I still haven't heard from him, and I'm worried something might have happened. Frank has no enemies except Diana."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Eric, I'm really concerned about Frank. I haven't been able to reach him for days."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="463.html">« Prev</a><a href="465.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
