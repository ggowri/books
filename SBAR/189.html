"Why are you still here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing Diana awake, Steven finally felt relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You're my wife, and you're lying in a hospital. Where do you think I should be?" he asked, his voice equally hoarse, with a hint of anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana suddenly found him amusing. "Steven, can't you see that every inch of me despises you?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Just leave. I don't want to see you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After saying this, Diana closed her eyes, hoping to find peace in not seeing him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She couldn't understand where things had gone wrong or why Steven suddenly refused to divorce her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven stood up and said, "Get some rest. I have a meeting at the branch office this morning. I'll come back after and we can talk."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana opened her eyes and looked at him. "There's nothing to discuss other than the divorce. I know you were involved in last night's incident, but I can't catch the mastermind."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's brows furrowed. Damn, he really couldn't trace the mastermind behind last night's events.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She didn't trust him; saying more was useless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He let out a faint sigh and turned to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At the door, Steven ran into Cecil, who was carrying lunch. Cecil had changed into casual clothes, making him look even more dashing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Anger clouded Steven's eyes. "What are you doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil's charming eyes sparkled with a hint of a smile. "Mr. Gellar, can't you see the lunch in my hand? I know Diana won't eat what you bought. If I didn't come, Diana would be starving."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His words hit Steven right in the heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana truly wouldn't eat the lunch that Steven bought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">All Diana had for him now was hatred, and he could feel it intensely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Take it to her," Steven said, a trace of sadness in his eyes, as he strode away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil then carried the lunch inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hearing Cecil's voice, Diana slowly sat up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She smiled gently. "Cecil, you're here. How's your health?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil placed the lunch on the table. "Not bad. I can walk again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Relieved, Diana went to freshen up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven had arranged for her to stay in a deluxe VIP room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There were clean clothes prepared inside, which she didn't refuse. She washed up and got dressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She transferred some money to Evan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She then sent a message to Evan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">[Evan, tell your boss this is for yesterday's medical expenses and clothes. Thank you for last night.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After sending the message, she headed out for lunch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan received the message just as Steven got into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan transferred the money to Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven saw it, frowning at Evan, signaling him to explain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan explained, "Mr. Gellar, Ms. Bishop sent the money, saying it's for medical bills and clothes. She also thanked you for last night!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's gaze darkened. "Do you accept it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan nodded. "Boss, ever since Queenie came back, you said not to care about Ms. Bishop's well-being and that I must report all her messages and actions to you to avoid upsetting Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"And you also said Diana doesn't deserve to use your money, so I just..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Drive," Steven ordered furiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The anger that had been building up all night finally erupted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan, however, was pleased. Finally, he felt a sense of inexplicable relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Stay strong, Ms. Bishop. You must stand firm. Let that jerk be stuck with his mistress."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's handsome face grew even colder. Those words were spoken in anger after Diana mistreated Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He never expected Evan and Diana to remember, while he himself had forgotten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Thinking of Diana's attitude, Steven grew even more anxious. Diana truly didn't love him anymore.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="188.html">« Prev</a><a href="190.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
