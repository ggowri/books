"Steven, this is the last time Grandpa and everyone in the Bishop family will trust you. If you betray Diana again or hurt my Diana one more time, I'll personally step in and cut off whatever's between you two."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Watching you bully my precious granddaughter before&mdash;you have no idea how much it hurt me. If your grandfather hadn't held me back, telling me to wait a little longer, and if my granddaughter didn't care for you, you wouldn't be this lucky today. You really got on my nerves, kid."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold felt both angry and heartbroken. Thinking about all the pain his granddaughter had endured made his chest tight with emotion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was deeply grateful for everything Leopold and his own grandfather had done. Without them, he never would have met someone as wonderful as Diana. He smiled gently. "Grandpa, it'll never happen again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Good! I'll call your grandfather and have them come over for dinner tonight. We'll have a family reunion. Now that Diana's having a baby, this child will be the heir to both the Bishop and Young families. You better take good care of Diana and the baby she's carrying." Leopold's tone carried a warning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled. "Grandpa, I'll take care of Diana."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold beamed. "Oh! Seeing you two so in love, and now with a great-grandchild on the way&mdash;I could die happy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grandpa, don't say things like that." Diana playfully tugged at his arm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold laughed, his eyes full of affection. "Alright, alright, I won't say it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold spotted Hubery. "Well! Isn't that Hubery? I thought I was seeing things."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hubery smiled. "Grandpa, I'm back."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold pointed at him. "You little rascal, it's good you're back, good you're back. Go inside and rest."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone headed inside together. Steven had been here twice before, but he hadn't realized this was where Diana had been living all along. Looking at the clean white minimalist decor, he found himself liking it&mdash;bright and simple.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At dinner, Steven's parents and grandparents all came. Steven's relationship with his parents had improved, and Diana felt happy seeing it. Steven had been so lonely as a child, but now he had so many family members around him. This long-overdue family bond had finally arrived despite all the complications, and everyone was happy now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's mother looked at Diana with a smile, taking her hands as tears welled up in her eyes. "Diana, thank you! Your persistence gave us our family back. From now on, I'll protect you&mdash;no one will be able to hurt you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tomorrow, if I have time, let me take you shopping for beautiful clothes and jewelry, okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now she could finally be there for her son and daughter-in-law alongside her husband, and she could fulfill her duties as a mother. Soon she'd be holding her grandchild. This kind of happiness was beyond her wildest dreams, yet here it was, becoming reality. She felt both thrilled and excited. It was because of Diana that their family had held on this long, that they'd brought the bad guys to justice, that they could finally be reunited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven suddenly spoke up. "Mom, let Diana rest tomorrow. We'll go to the hospital for a checkup the day after, then go shopping for clothes and jewelry. Or I can have people bring everything to the house for you to choose from."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I asked the doctor earlier&mdash;pregnant women get tired easily. Diana's been sleeping a lot today. She needs more rest."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's mother smiled at her son's caring words. "Steven, you've always been thoughtful. Seeing how well you and Diana get along now puts my mind at ease."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Diana's forgiveness, Steven's attitude toward his parents had softened considerably. "Dad, Mom, if you're free these days, could you help me pick out the menu for the wedding reception? I'll handle the other details."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew and Steven's mother both lit up with joy at his words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's wonderful, Steven! Dad can finally see you get married. Your grandfather, grandmother, and I have been waiting for this day for so long." Andrew couldn't have been happier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A slight smile tugged at Steven's lips, but his eyes found Diana. Leopold and the three Bishop brothers didn't look too thrilled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold shifted uncomfortably. "Edward, marriage is serious business for both families. Let's hold off until Diana has the baby. I don't want my granddaughter worn out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edward could read Leopold like a book&mdash;the old man was pissed. "You stubborn fool, I'm sitting right here! You think I'd let your granddaughter marry my grandson empty-handed? The Young family's putting up the entire Gellar Corporation as dowry. We're not cheating the Bishop family."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph!" Leopold huffed. "I'll throw in the whole Bishop empire as her dowry&mdash;that's worth more than whatever your Young family's offering."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edward laughed. "Alright, alright, let's not turn this into a pissing contest. When are you taking Diana back to see her father? With the Young family behind her and these three boys in her corner, we can definitely help sort out your family mess."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Bishop family fortune could rival small countries&mdash;exactly why he'd pushed so hard for his grandson to marry Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold's expression softened as he looked at Diana. "Diana, your father loves you more than life itself. He sneaks over to see you every Christmas. Would you want to go back and visit him?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's face lit up. "Grandpa, absolutely. Once we deal with Queenie, we'll head home."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold practically glowed with excitement. "Edward, you've always wanted to see my place, right? This time, bring the whole clan."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edward was over the moon. "Perfect! If I could visit your home just once before I die, I'd go out happy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's chest tightened, her heart hammering. Emotions crashed through her like a tidal wave. What the hell was her real identity?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That night, the Bishop and Young families celebrated together. But Steven and Diana still went back to their old villa. As husband and wife, they needed to live together&mdash;Steven wasn't budging on that. Diana had no choice but to follow him home.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When they got back, Evan and Luna were already there.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Boss, Mrs. Young, welcome back," Evan said with a grin.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled back. "Good to be back. There are presents for everyone in that suitcase&mdash;help yourselves."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sweet!" Evan's face lit up. "Thanks for the gifts, Mrs. Young."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven cut to the chase. "What's the deal with Queenie?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan's expression turned nasty. "After we bought out her company, she had nowhere to run, but she bolted anyway. Queenie's got nothing left now. With Mrs. Young back, we definitely need to watch her back."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana went still. That fast&mdash;Queenie had lost everything. In her past life, she would've been a business mogul by now, living it up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's eyes narrowed dangerously. If Queenie was going nuclear, she'd definitely target either her or Paula&mdash;one of them was going to get hurt.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing that Queenie was completely screwed, Steven's eyes went ice-cold. He looked at Evan, dead set on protecting Diana. "Find her. We're hunting her down and handing her over to the cops with all the evidence. We're not letting her walk away this time."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1171.html">« Prev</a><a href="1173.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
