He knew she was a bit tired, but they had to go to the scene now. "Diana, it will be over soon. Grandpa really wants to see you too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana saw through Steven's thoughts at a glance, but she didn't expose him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "Is it Edward who wants to see me? Clearly, Steven wants to use this opportunity to completely clear his name in public and distance himself from Queenie."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter what he did in the past, at least now, Queenie and George's matters must have nothing to do with him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana suddenly became interested. If he cleared his name and the company thrived, she would ultimately be the one to benefit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "Well, who would say no to money?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go, I want to see how surprised George will be when he sees you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing villains make a fool of themselves always lifts her spirits.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven instinctively smiled, his eyes full of her playful expression. "Alright. Can you get up?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana froze, her eyes wide open. "Are you treating me like a baby?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "Can I get up?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Is that something he should be asking me?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Do I look like I can't get up?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven leaned close to her ear and said in a deep voice, "Diana, your body is too soft. It always takes me a long time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's face instantly turned red, and certain images uncontrollably flashed through her mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hey......"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She rolled her eyes and quickly rushed into the bathroom to freshen up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was in a great mood. Looking at the bright spring sunlight outside the window, he seemed to see a ray of hope.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the crack slowly widened, a beam of light shone through.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man in her dream, was it him?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only his silhouette was there, praying for his wife and child to return.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He still remembered the dream being cold, with snow falling heavily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana moved quickly, finishing up in just a few minutes. Even without makeup, she still looked stunning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She just put on some lipstick, worried her lips might dry out in the strong March wind. Then, she smiled at Steven, "Let's go."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she casually put the lipstick back in her bag.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When they went downstairs, Evan had already prepared the car and was waiting.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, they no longer have to live behind masks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three quickly headed to Andrew's office.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, people were fervently discussing in the reporters' live broadcast room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A paternity test is being conducted on-site, fully supervised by reporters and relevant authorities, ensuring no possibility of fraud.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the assistance of relevant authorities, the paternity test was completed quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Steven and the other two arrived, they happened to catch the announcement of the results.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When everyone saw Steven and Diana arrive, they were stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A reporter suddenly thrust a microphone in front of Steven and asked, "Excuse me, are you really Mr. Gellar?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, George, standing opposite him, turned pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was stunned and, after a long pause, muttered, "How can you still be alive?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire room erupted, and everyone turned to look at George.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why would he ask that?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven took Diana by the hand and walked straight in without even glancing at him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan waved his fist at George provocatively.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if two identical people stood together, their temperaments were worlds apart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven appeared stern and composed, exuding a sharp aura, while George unconsciously became self-conscious in his presence. His eyes flickered, filled with timidity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing them arrive, Edward bypassed Steven and directly grabbed Diana's hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sweet pea, good girl. You've had a tough time these years."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was stunned. Apart from her own grandfather and three brothers, no one called her that. "Edward, do you know my grandfather?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edward shot Steven a glare, as if blaming him for not telling Diana anything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven pressed his lips together, staying silent, thinking, "What did I do wrong this time?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He clearly hadn't said a word.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When he accidentally met Andrew's gaze, Andrew was so emotional that tears welled up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven awkwardly looked away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edward said excitedly, "Sweet pea, we'll talk about this later. I'll tell you the whole truth."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana replied, "Alright."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anyway, she was already shocked enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were definitely hiding something from her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The discussion in the livestream chat got even crazier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>[Oh my god! They really look exactly the same! Their genes are terrifying!]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This comment instantly sparked a frenzy of heated discussion online.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many netizens chimed in, sharing their vastly different opinions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some netizens marveled at the extreme resemblance between the two.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>[Even if they're twins, they wouldn't look this alike. It's like they were copy-pasted.]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, many netizens focused more on the differences in their demeanor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>[Although they look the same, their demeanor is completely different. A double can never imitate the original.]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>[Steven's innate dominance is in his bones, George can't compare.]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>[You're right. A double might mimic the appearance, but the demeanor in his every move comes from long-term experience and inner cultivation, it can't be faked. Steven is amazing!]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Online discussions are surging, and the truth at the scene is about to be revealed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The answer at the scene is about to be revealed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George finally couldn't hold back and hysterically shouted, "Steven! How did you survive?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He then looked at Evan and said, "And you! Weren't you in prison?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan coldly explained, "That's right. I did go to prison, but it was my own plan. If I hadn't done that, I would have been your scapegoat long ago."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As for why Mr. Gellar is still alive, on the day of the car accident, I knew it was your trick. I stayed at the hospital and saw with my own eyes as you threw him, fresh out of surgery, into the sea to feed the sharks. Unfortunately for you, I arrived in time with my team and rescued him from the sea. That's how we survived."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, George looked at Diana with a complicated expression. "So you knew all along that I wasn't Steven?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at Diana with a complicated gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana blinked and happily replied, "Of course, from the moment I first saw you, I knew you weren't Steven. I didn't recognize you in the photo before. But the moment you stood in front of me, I knew clearly that you weren't Steven."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana grew angrier as she spoke. "Queenie kept using your photos together to provoke me, trying to force me to leave so she could rightfully marry Steven, then kill him and have you take his place."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I didn't expose Queenie and you because I was waiting for today to let everyone see the truth and your true colors."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George suddenly laughed, but he looked extremely unusual. "Diana, I thought you loved Steven. I took his place hoping you'd come back to cling to me, love me the way you loved him before. But why did you suddenly stop loving me?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1083.html">« Prev</a><a href="1085.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
