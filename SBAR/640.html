That's why Dad and I left you.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, Dad and I are sorry for you, but we have to consider our own safety."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Queenie could only put all the blame on Paula.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Paula was thought to be insane, her words would be mere nonsense.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula froze. She was still not prepared enough. If Queenie could prove that she had a mental illness, everything she had done before would be in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula immediately beat her chest and stamped her feet in great pain. "Queenie, you are lying. Your father and you left me because my company owed two billion dollars in debt. Afraid that the creditors would come after you, you forced me to get a divorce and cut off all ties with my four sons."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took out a letter of severance from her bag and showed it to everyone. "Everyone, look, this is the letter of severance that Jeff personally compelled my sons to sign. It was not until this moment that I realized that Queenie was the biological daughter of Jeff and this woman. To live happily with the mother and daughter, he didn't want my children.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jeff has deceived me my whole life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When a reporter came over, Paula showed the letter of severance to Jeff.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been just acting in front of everyone, even her two close friends, just for this letter of severance.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want her children to have anything to do with Jeff.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could she abandon her children? Yet, she was determined to trick Jeff into going to the extreme first.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then would her four children be joyful, reform, and behave themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone read the letter of severance in Paula's hand and glanced at Jeff with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he was overwhelmed with shame.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last night, he dreamed that he had fallen off a cliff. He had always believed in the imprecision of winter dreams, but this one really was an omen. At that moment, as a man who valued his face and his dignity, he felt as if he were being tortured.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A lady suddenly said, "I have never seen such a shameless person! What a wretch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah. He got involved with his ex-girlfriend, brought back their daughter for his wife to raise, and abandoned his daughter with his wife without her noticing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Therefore, he must have kept in touch with his mistress. This is pure marriage fraud. He is lying. He claimed that he was being stupid back then, but I think everything was calculated."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maeve Lopez was a good friend of Paula's. Upon hearing what had happened to her, as a witness to what she had done for her children, Maeve shouted, "Paula is so pitiful. We have all seen how she raised Queenie over the years. She even gave up time to cultivate her four sons and just wanted her daughter to be excellent. Everyone knows that Queenie excels at playing the piano, dancing, playing chess, and painting. It's all because of Paula's careful education.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But she is such an ungrateful person. Instead of appreciating everything her foster mother has done, she even calls her a psychopath.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paula previously borrowed 100 million dollars from our family. My husband found out that she was being tricked. However, she sold all her assets and paid off the debts during this period.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She is normal and not insane. I have been meeting her these past two days. She is in a very low mood, but her mind is clear. She has absolutely no mental problems. After being forced to divorce by Jeff and Queenie, she even worried about him because he was about to develop Alzheimer's disease."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This last sentence pleased Paula. Complaining to Maeve proved to be of help.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="639.html">« Prev</a><a href="641.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
