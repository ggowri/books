You spent billions on her, and she doesn't even know what you like to eat, haha..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hearing Evan's gloating laughter, Steven knew he was being teased.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He tiredly rubbed his forehead and stood up to get some water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven had insomnia that night, and the next day, he didn't look too well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">During the morning meeting, everyone in the conference room spoke carefully. They were afraid of saying something wrong and being kicked out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When it was Emma's turn, she presented the new winter collection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing Emma made him think of Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After listening to Emma's team's suggestions, Steven said, "Ms. Milton, last year's winter collection generated two billion in sales, and your designs are well-known. This year, let's push for 2.5 billion. I'll meet your requests, but you need to hit the targets."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After hearing that, Emma was full of confidence. She smiled warmly. "Thank you, Mr. Gellar, I won't let you down."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven didn't want to be disappointed either, knowing the competitor had already signed with the Powell Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Partnering with the Powell Group, Diana's designs were solid, and Nolan's company would likely surpass last year's revenue by half.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Meeting adjourned." His tall figure stood up, and he walked out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Emma was in a good mood, watching Steven's back as he left, feeling like she was getting closer to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was certain she could make Steven see her in a better light.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven and Evan returned to the office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie had already arrived, wearing a pink dress with her long hair down. It was a look Steven used to like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was holding a thermos. When she saw Steven, she smiled sweetly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Steven, I came to see you. I made some pumpkin soup for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan almost laughed when he heard that. She was really going for it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He quietly slipped away, not wanting to stick around for the drama.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie, smiling, reached to hold Steven's arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven subtly moved away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie froze for a moment, then asked in a hurt tone, "Steven, how can you ignore me just because Diana said a few things?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie never missed a chance to undermine Diana. She was insightful and knew how to play to men's emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She knew how to compete with Diana for Steven's attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was a risky move. If she won, she could live like a queen. If she lost, she'd only lose Steven, but the result would still be what she wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven sat on the sofa under the soft light, which cast a lazy and indifferent glow over him. He rested his chin on his hand and asked casually, "Queenie, do you really think it's just a few words? Diana is my wife. I've given you the privileges she should have, what more do you want? Hmm?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His voice had a seductive lilt, making it impossible to ignore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie coldly laughed inside. Of course, she wasn't satisfied. Everything Steven had should've been hers, so why should he keep it all for himself?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Steven, I never wanted to compete with Diana. I just want you back by my side. You were going to marry me, remember?" Queenie lowered her head, tears silently falling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's gaze darkened. Before he could respond, Evan suddenly burst in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan, slightly out of breath, said, "Mr. Gellar, bad news. Harry's mom brought reporters and is causing trouble for Ms. Bishop across the street."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="138.html">« Prev</a><a href="140.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
