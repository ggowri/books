Steven, it's you. You're here to defend Queenie again, but I have nothing now. Are you trying to deliberately frame me as a mental patient, send me to a mental hospital, and then secretly kill me?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Frank is missing. Please, don't harm me. I really have nothing left. Jeff tricked me into marriage and cut off all ties with my four sons. My company was also snatched away. I sold all my property. I am really penniless. Please, don't harm me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula sat on the floor sadly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It indeed confirmed the fact that she was a victim.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gazing at Paula, Queenie was surprised that a proud woman like her should reveal her weakness.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula became a complete victim. Queenie instantly understood why she got Steven involved.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he had something to do with her, Paula's words would be more convincing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven teamed up with her to plot against the Barnes Group and Diana. Without his help, how could she make it?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the circle was aware of Paula's affection for her, so it was very persuasive for Paula to play the victim at this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it because she had nothing that Paula's backbone was broken?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who had nothing were reckless. Queenie suppressed her shock, glanced at Paula, and said, "I think your mental illness is flaring up again..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, how dare you still claim that she is mentally ill? In my opinion, you are delusional. Paula is so pitiful, but you insist that she is insane and slander everything about her and her care for you. Queenie, do you think you are worthy of being a public figure?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maeve helped Paula up. Paula looked at Queenie and sobbed, "Queenie, I was wrong. I will never dare to make trouble in front of you or disturb your family of three. Please don't harm me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was in a dilemma.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula begged, "Please don't harm me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every word sounded like thunder in Queenie's ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never been so embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paula, please stop making things difficult for Queenie. It was you who destroyed my relationship with Jeff..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you have been living in the villa that Jeff bought for you. I checked the transfer date of the villa, and it happened to be the second year after Queenie's birth. You obviously knew I was his wife, but I didn't know you at all. How could I have destroyed your relationship?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone who knows me learns how passionately Jeff pursued me back then. He was single at the time, and so was I. How could I become the other woman?" Paula asked painfully. Amelie wanted to put the blame on her. It was impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, Paula's goal was achieved. Queenie could no longer take advantage of her connections.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Lily showed up and roared, "Amelie, you shameless bitch, how dare you come to my banquet? When you slept with my husband, did you ever consider whether you could face me with a clear conscience?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The banquet was held by Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She specially invited Paula.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula had previously sent her a video of Amelie having sex with Mark.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was frightened at the sight of Lily. She had been beaten by Jeff because of the video.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If her affair with Mark were to be confirmed now, she would lose face in this circle, let alone become a noble lady, and would also be a hindrance to Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was depressed. Why?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did things come to this?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="643.html">« Prev</a><a href="645.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
