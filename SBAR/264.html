"Queenie, Elsie and I are heading out. Mom abandons me, but don't worry. I'll be back to see you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was taken aback. Paula had disowned Frank? What had happened?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Frank, what did Mom say? Why is she done with you? Is it still about you and Elsie? But from her earlier demeanor, it seemed like she had agreed!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula's stance this time was unyielding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank nodded. His face was etched with distress. He was in the dark about the household turmoil and could do little to aid the company now. "Yeah, she doesn't agree. Mom only favors Paige, the ideal wife she chooses for me, but I don't care for Paige. Elsie's the one I love. Since I was a kid, Mom's been trying to dictate my life, my major, my wife, and everything. Only you and Dad support my choices.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom's canceled all my credit cards. You'll have to handle Dad's affairs for now. Once I've sorted out the wedding, I'll come back to help with Dad."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was astonished and thought, "Paula had frozen all his cards in a fit of anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was it genuine fury, or had she discovered something?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Frank, with all your cards suspended, how will you manage?" Queenie was anxious, unable to fathom Paula's thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was equally perplexed, not understanding his mother's behavior.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, her anger was linked to Diana and Elsie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry, Queenie. I've got an entertainment company that's been raking in money. Mom's using this to pressure me into giving up Elsie, but I won't."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie was elated because Frank had fallen deeply for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With confidence, Frank whisked Elsie away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie sat on the sofa, lost in thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula's resolute attitude had shaken her, but as long as Frank remained committed to loving Elsie, all was well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With Frank now deeply entwined in his relationship with Elsie, the way was open for Queenie to focus her attention on dealing with Eric.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wearing a strange smile, Queenie exclaimed inwardly that everything was unfolding as planned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Regrettably, the sole exception was that Cecil's father had emerged with just minor scratches, essentially unscathed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She cursed, "Damn it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How could he escape with just minor injuries from such a severe accident?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie pursed her lips. The Foliot family was her next target.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Foliot family would be easier to manipulate than the Farley family. Jace doted on Queenie and had no defenses against her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Access to his study would yield a treasure trove of business secrets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A victorious smile graced her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She muttered, "Diana, you never should have returned to challenge me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In the end, I would emerge victorious, and you would suffer a devastating loss."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, Diana's dual roles as a designer and a doctor left her seething with envy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could someone brought up in the countryside become a designer and a doctor?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The identity of her adoptive family was shrouded in mystery, presenting nothing more than an unremarkable backdrop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie thought, "It was all Dad's fault for not being ruthless enough to finish off Diana when he had the chance. Otherwise, I didn't have to deal with all this trouble now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Diana freshened up, she climbed into bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her phone rang just as she settled in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She picked it up, seeing Paige's name on the screen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It had been a while since they last spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank must have returned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sitting up, she answered the call with a smile, "Paige, it's been ages."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, I'm sorry. I've been swamped with work at the company, trying to get a handle on things. I've been so busy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana replied, "Congratulations, Paige. I've seen your company's financial reports; it's been thriving over the past two years."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana also pored over financial reports daily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really? I was so naive back then, not realizing how hard my parents worked. I've been learning from Dad every day for the past six months, and I'm getting the hang of it, but there's still so much to improve."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana knew Paige was a diligent girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, Diana couldn't help but ponder what the purpose of the call was this evening.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="263.html">« Prev</a><a href="265.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
