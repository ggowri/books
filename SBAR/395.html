"Does he need to feel guilty about this? It's a fact that he betrayed me. I can only wish them a long-lasting relationship. I am very tolerant and forgiving."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She glanced at the sea and saw a beautiful crescent moon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She took a deep breath to calm herself down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana desired to live a wonderful life in such a beautiful world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her smile was dazzling and charming, and she was incredibly striking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Paige, we will get better and better."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana turned to Paige.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige sensed her endless expectations for the future, which seemed to cheer her up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah!" Paige excitedly took her arm, and they headed towards the beach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She took Diana there for a barbecue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The grilled oysters were delicious, and the grilled squids were very tender.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After dinner, Diana even took one portion back home for a midnight snack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She got inspired today and would draw design drafts later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she had a habit of finding something to eat at night. Perhaps it was the loneliness that overwhelmed her when she was alone.&#8203;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige and Diana walked back through a coconut grove. The street lights were so dim that the path was a little dark.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige comforted her. "Diana, there are many men in the world. Although Steven has betrayed you, it doesn't matter. You can find a better man in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, don't meet Steven again. You are beautiful. He doesn't deserve you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana grinned. Deep down in her heart, she was eager to stay away from Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven loves Queenie. We all realized how important she is to him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige laughed angrily. "I always feel that Queenie will finally disgust him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Diana was alone and powerless now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She couldn't deal with Queenie, who was scheming and shameless, but those men believed her tender pretense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, not all men would fall for her tricks, and she would meet her nemesis one day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked at Paige's angry face and said nothing. She was just waiting for Queenie to make a scene and force Steven to get a divorce.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#8203;Knowing that he was reluctant to divorce, Queenie would try to persuade him and find opportunities to get him to part ways with her. Now, Diana only had to wait patiently for Queenie to make her move. It would be soon. In order to marry Steven, Queenie would definitely drug him and have the reporters intervene. In her previous life, she had done such things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This time, as long as Diana didn't attend the banquet, Queenie's plan would succeed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige was right. There were thousands of excellent men in the world, and Diana didn't have to be obsessed with Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Besides, he was a bastard who was devoted to another woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was always aware that a forced marriage would not be happy. Steven liked Queenie, so it was not suitable for him and Diana to be together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Edward insisted on marrying Steven to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After living two lives, Diana still didn't understand why.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven preferred the hypocritical Queenie. How weird! Why did he fall in love with such a bitch?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Diana couldn't imitate her, nor would she mimic another woman to please him. In front of him, she was always herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had a clear conscience during their marriage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Steven...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey! Ladies, what a great night! Would you like to have a date?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#8203;Suddenly, four men rushed out of the coconut grove and surrounded Diana and Paige.&#8203;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="394.html">« Prev</a><a href="396.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
