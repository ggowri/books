After letting it go, she could talk about the things between Steven and Queenie very easily. She still felt pain, but she could face it with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought that in a person's life, there would be a memory that he could never forget.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But sometimes, the world was perfect without that person.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana still hoped to meet a man who loved her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing these words, Steven felt difficulty breathing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood at the door, listening to what the three people said with cold eyes. If he hadn't come, he would never know that in the eyes of others, he regarded Queenie as a treasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Diana believed that firmly in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was very upset. Was Queenie too cunning, or was he too stupid?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan saw Steven's gloomy face. Steven originally wanted to have an encounter with Diana, but he didn't expect to hear gossip about himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He heard Diana say that she no longer cared about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan could see that Diana no longer loved Steven since the day she left.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked in a low voice, "Mr. Gellar, are you still going in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would be impolite to go in now because they would disturb Diana and her friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven didn't say anything, and he looked cold. He was a taciturn person and would laugh when he was angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Steven couldn't laugh anymore because his wife was about to leave him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, Alexander is very good. Why don't you consider him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige's voice successfully stopped Steven from leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, "I need to get divorced first. I plan to go abroad in the future. I'm still young. Maybe I'll date someone when I'm 30 years old."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea said, "When you are 30 years old, my son will be in elementary school. You will be a little old."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not old at all. I can start a new life at every age." Diana's voice was very happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven didn't listen to the rest of their words. He only remembered one thing. Diana no longer loved him and even wanted to leave this place.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face turned cold, with anger in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just at this moment, Mario called him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Steven hung up the phone, Mario called again.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned, his voice filled with anger. "What's up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, Ms. Marsh has fainted and is now in the hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven became angrier. "Why are you calling me? You should look for a doctor."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hung up the phone after he finished speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario was stunned and narrowed his eyes. Steven's voice was too cold, making Mario have a feeling of unease in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that Steven no longer doted on Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For so many years, Steven had always treated Queenie as a treasure. But now...</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie just woke up and saw Mario in a daze. She asked weakly, "Mario, will Steven come?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="765.html">« Prev</a><a href="767.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
