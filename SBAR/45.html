"Diana, but there was evidence every time you set Queenie up. How do you explain that?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven only became angry after seeing the evidence every time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was obviously gentle and kind, but why did she change when Queenie came back?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said she didn't love Steven anymore, and this sentence deeply stung his heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing such words, Diana just felt ridiculous and wondered why she was here arguing with him about such meaningless things.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wouldn't believe her!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at Steven, her eyes bright and honest. "Steven, I don't know when I've learned not to explain myself. Even when I feel helpless, aggravated, embarrassed, I have so much to say, you've never gotten to know me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at the night sky in the distance calmly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked over and just thought she looked incredibly exhausted and miserable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He too became incredibly sorrowful.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, I'll try to know you. We won't get divorced, and you need to stay away from Alexander, okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana slowly withdrew her gaze as she laughed in exasperation, thinking, "How could there be such a shameless man?" She smiled and asked rhetorically, "How would you explain that to Queenie?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How would you explain it to everyone? How will you explain to the Marsh family that you and I haven't gotten divorced yet? You wouldn't even dare tell everyone that I'm your wife. You stay with Queenie, so why don't you distance yourself from her?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was stunned, and he hadn't thought about it. Queenie had been with him since before, everyone thought they were perfect for each other, and he had never argued against it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing him silent and acquiescing, Diana continued to feel heartbroken. "Steven, I've only met one man as shameless as you. For Queenie's sake, you should divorce me. You love her so much, so you can't afford to let her be slandered by others."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her tone was calm, so calm that Steven panicked inside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, I..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Bishop, get in the car." Luna parked the car steadily in front of Diana, turned her head, and called her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without looking at Steven, Diana opened the car door and got in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven frowned and watched Diana helplessly as she left.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Forget it, I'll just wait until she figures it out on her own. She used to figure it out in a few days, so I will give her a little more time this time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was so busy every day after working with Henry that he didn't have time to comfort Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he felt terribly upset.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Evan returned from driving Queenie, Steven opened the car door and got in, asking Evan to drive him home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven leaned wearily against the car window, the words of Diana deafening in his mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt more and more irritated. He put the window down and thought about the way Diana had been appearing to dress lately, and it seemed that she wasn't as simple as they thought she was.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By the time they divorced, she chose not to take a dime of the property with her. He thought she was doing it for self-esteem and didn't want anything from him, but now it seemed not to be true, and she probably didn't really need the money.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The diamond necklace Diana was wearing at the Farley family's party seemed to him like he had seen it somewhere before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he couldn't remember where he had seen it before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of her talking and laughing with Alexander, a surge of anger couldn't help but surge into Steven's mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Besides, how could she know the language of Avernia?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt Diana was mysterious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked over at Evan and said in a hoarse voice, "Evan, go investigate Diana tomorrow. Use whatever you can to find out who she really is." </span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="44.html">« Prev</a><a href="46.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
