Who were you expecting to see standing here? Alexander?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana saw the displeasure on his face and nodded. "Yes, I was kind of hoping it would be him. He's gentle, kind, and considerate. Of course, I'd prefer it if he were the one standing here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eyes turned icy. "Diana, now that you've got Alexander to lean on, you've gotten pretty bold with your words."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew things weren't easy for Alexander either. The Powell family was in the middle of a fierce internal struggle. If she kept getting involved with Alexander and dragging him into scandals, it could really cause trouble for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not wanting to hear Steven's sarcastic tone, she asked, "How did you get in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She distinctly remembered locking the door when she came in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's lips curved into a mocking smile. He had managed to sneak a glance at the door code earlier and had simply let himself in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, don't you realize that Alexander is in the middle of a power struggle within the Powell family? If he gets caught up in rumors, things will only get tougher for him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was slightly taken aback. She knew this already, but when Alexander asked to see her, she hadn't given it much thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were friends, and she had no romantic interest in Alexander. She just wanted his help with business matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She resolved to be more cautious in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing has happened between us. But someone with a filthy mind like yours sees filth in everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glared at him, then left the study and locked the door behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave. I'm going to bed," she said as she headed to the room next door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven followed her. The last time he stayed over, they had shared a bed, and he had slept surprisingly well. He thought that having someone next to him would disrupt his sleep, but with Diana, he found it incredibly comfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Diana entered the room, she tried to close the door, but seeing Steven standing there made her angry. "Mr. Gellar, we're getting divorced. Please keep your distance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She moved to shut the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven quickly blocked her, his eyes dark and intense. He felt that she had become bolder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She used to crave his presence at home every day, but now it seemed like all she wanted was for him to stay far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This drastic change was hard for Steven to accept.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped inside quickly, wrapping his arms around Diana's waist. With a swift move, he pinned her against the wall and then gently pushed the door shut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes widened in alarm. "Steven, what are you doing? Let go of me. Don't touch me&mdash;I hate it when you touch me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She recalled seeing him with Queenie, their arms around each other, and the thought made her feel sick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at her fearful expression. Diana's eyes were filled with anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some reason, he found her to be especially endearing in this state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana," he murmured, tilting his head slightly, his eyes fixed on her face as he gently called her name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's voice was tense and urgent. "Steven, let go of me. Just let me go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The difference in their strength was clear. She struggled as hard as she could, but Steven didn't budge. His arms felt like iron bars, holding her tightly in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lowering his head, he lightly bit her lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears began to roll down her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She really, truly hated Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn't understand why, after she had chosen to step aside and let him be with Queenie, he still felt the need to torment her.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="593.html">« Prev</a><a href="595.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
