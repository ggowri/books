Those involved were sent to where they belonged, and a lot of money was made in the process.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Every time he took action, only he and his assistant handled it personally.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His assistant was an expert, capable of making the crime scenes appear as if they ended their life themselves.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Over the past decade, he had made a lot of money and had enjoyed everything there was to enjoy.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Those people died in accidents, so no one would be held accountable. Besides, he gave enough money to silence their families, but most of them were orphans without parents.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Aside from him and his assistant, no one else could know about it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Moreover, Queenie had never been to his office. It was always he who came to find her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His office was generally not open to just anyone. Even when hosting important guests, he would entertain them in the meeting room next to his office.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Watching his shocked expression, Queenie couldn&#x27;t help but sneer inwardly, &quot;He is nothing more than a murderer.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Beneath his gentle appearance, he hides terrible means.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She smiled, &quot;Zion, how do you feel about the big gift I gave you? You really shouldn&#x27;t have plotted against me. If you had just kept quiet and terminated the contract without causing any trouble, maybe I wouldn&#x27;t have reported you, and we could still cooperate. But you had to make me pay the penalty for breaching the contract, so now I have no choice but to send you to prison.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;How wonderful,&quot; she thought. &quot;Now that Zion is caught, I can take control of his company.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As for the people behind him, if I can reach out to them, I can work with them, too.</p><p style="text-align:left;">What he can do, I can do just the same.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Zion couldn&#x27;t believe a woman would defeat him. He stared at her intensely and growled, &quot;Queenie, you vicious woman! I don&#x27;t believe you know everything.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie let out a soft laugh, her gaze dropping slightly as she looked at him. &quot;Zion, if I told you I saw you in a dream, and that&#x27;s how I knew everything you&#x27;ve done. Do you believe me?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Zion was at a loss for words.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She leaned back gracefully in her wheelchair, her expression calm, but her smile full of smug satisfaction. &quot;Zion, isn&#x27;t it strange? I somehow knew everything you did in my dream, even how you used orphans without parents or people who died in accidents to run your shady business.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He shuddered, unable to believe her words.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She claimed it was a dream. What kind of logic was that?</p><p style="text-align:left;">There was no such thing as being able to foresee the future.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;It&#x27;s impossible, Queenie. Don&#x27;t think you can trick me. I can let you off the hook for the breach of contract...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Too late,&quot; Queenie interrupted loudly, her voice sharp. &quot;Zion, you&#x27;re like a venomous snake. If I let you go today, you&#x27;ll find a way to kill me tomorrow. So, I&#x27;m not going to spare you.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">If she let him go today, tomorrow would be her death sentence.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A person like Zion, determined to eliminate all threats, would be more ruthless than anyone else.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Instantly, an oppressive and terrifying aura surrounded him, and a strong sense of murderous intent came rushing at her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Queenie, if you don&#x27;t let me live, then let&#x27;s go to hell together.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He stood up abruptly, picked up the cup on the table, and threw it at her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Freeze! Put your weapon down.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Suddenly, a policeman appeared at the door.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Zion shrank as he saw the police enter. His eyes were filled with fear as he looked at Queenie, sitting in the wheelchair. She had no intention of letting him go. Whether or not he requested for the breach of the contract fee, she was determined to make him pay with his life.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Zion forced a bitter smile. &quot;Queenie, I&#x27;ve been running this gray business for ten years. Everything is going smoothly, but I never expected to be destroyed by your hands. In the end, the one who ruined me was you.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie smiled at him. &quot;Mr. Swift, you&#x27;re wrong. It wasn&#x27;t me who destroyed you. You destroyed yourself. If you hadn&#x27;t done those things, who could have ruined you?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He sneered, &quot;Queenie, do you think that after destroying me, you&#x27;ll be safe? The people behind me are something you&#x27;ll never be able to plot with. They will destroy you. Although I won&#x27;t live to see that day, you&#x27;ll be ruined by them. I am their living brand in the shady industry. You&#x27;ve smashed their brand, and what you&#x27;ll suffer from them will be a thousand times worse than the pain you feel now.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She didn&#x27;t doubt his words, but she also knew that things would take their course.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was still uncertain who would destroy whom in the end.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After she reported it, the police had already made all the necessary arrangements.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Zion Swift, you are under arrest. The evidence we found in your office is all here.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The police captain walked in steadily, his gaze fixed on Zion.</p><p style="text-align:left;">They never expected that the person they had been investigating for a long time, someone involved in illegal dealings with foreign countries, would be none other than the top agent who appeared on television every day.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Zion stared at Queenie with eyes full of hatred, as if looking at a dead person.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie remained unshaken. Compared to Zion, her cruelty was nothing, but she had no fear.</p><p style="text-align:left;">People sought through risk for fortune. Every person at the top has blood on their hands.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Zion was taken away, and all the crimes he had committed were made public.</p><p style="text-align:left;">[Top Agent Zion Swift Arrested for Organ Trafficking! Evidence Conclusive.]</p><p style="text-align:left;">As soon as the news broke, it was quickly trending on social media.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The comment section exploded.</p><p style="text-align:left;">[This news is insane! To think that Zion Swift, a top agent, would be involved in a heinous scheme, it&#x27;s absolutely shocking!]</p><p style="text-align:left;">[I&#x27;m in total shock! Zion was involved in such dark dealings. He must be severely punished to give the victims justice!]</p><p style="text-align:left;">[I used to admire Zion Swift. He had so many successful artists under him, but it turns out he was a devil in disguise, trafficking organs. He&#x27;s unforgivable!]</p><p style="text-align:left;">[Zion&#x27;s actions are a serious violation of both morality and law. People like him deserve the harshest punishment!]</p><p style="text-align:left;">The internet was buzzing with all kinds of opinions.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The whole day, the trending topics online were all about Queenie and Zion, making the internet quite lively.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Diana, something happened to Zion.&quot; Cecil rushed in from the door.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana, who was working, glanced up at the panicked Cecil and paused for a moment. &quot;Cecil, why are you so flustered?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Diana, Zion was arrested. Queenie reported him.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;What?&quot; Diana&#x27;s eyes widened in shock.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her eyes filled with deep surprise. &quot;Do you think she was reborn as well? If you can be reborn, so can she. Just like me.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cecil nodded slightly. &quot;Yes, she knows about Zion&#x27;s dealings. We can probably guess what kind of person she will become in the future?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He was a bit worried. It wasn&#x27;t about the losses he would face, but the malicious intentions from the woman.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He walked over to Diana and asked, &quot;Diana, what should we do next?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="987.html">« Prev</a><a href="989.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
