Let's have these tonight and try other dishes next time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I rarely came here to eat before. It was only after dining here twice that I realized such delicious food was hidden in a small alley."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, you'll find the food here really delicious."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled, "Cecil, you've changed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil used to be cynical, reckless, and would hit people when unhappy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now he has become much gentler. Although he still carries that unruly demeanor, he is more mature.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching someone grow, Steven also felt a sense of pride.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil said, "Steven, it's all because I met Diana. She saved me and rescued the Farley family."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Having a new lease on life, I won't repeat my mistakes."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil looked at Diana. She was chatting with Olivia, laughing happily, like a sprite in the night.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Her smile can light up souls struggling in the darkness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said gently, "I'm so proud she's my wife."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil punched his chest hard and warned him, "Steven, if you dare to betray her, I will never forgive you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "Cecil, don't worry. In this life, I will protect her and make her happy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil smiled, "I hope you can keep your word. Those who have hurt me are not trustworthy. Diana is giving you another chance. If you hurt her again, you're trash."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, life is too short. There are so many things we don't have time to do before it ends. That feeling is too painful."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When I was a teenager, all I knew was having fun. In my twenties, I only caused trouble. Now, nearing thirty, someone finally woke me up. It's okay to grow up slowly, but you must make the right choices."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven knew Cecil was talking about himself. After going through so much, he had now fully awakened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven patted his shoulder. "Cecil, Diana came back to save us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil thought the same. "Then in this life, we must protect her. Diana and Olivia are both kind girls."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was displeased. "Cecil, I'll protect Diana myself!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil smiled and walked toward the two girls.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the future, he wouldn't allow anyone to bully them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He would always protect the two most important women in his life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are you two talking about?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled and said, "We were talking about you. Why would you come to such a remote restaurant? I remember you used to..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil smiled and interrupted her, "Diana, I can eat anywhere now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Such a nice restaurant, Olivia brought me here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at Olivia and said, "Olivia, let's sleep together tonight."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No way," Steven, sitting beside her, refused.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana asked, "Why? Olivia is my good friend."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven whispered, "You're a married woman."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil hugged Olivia, looked at Diana, and smiled, "Diana, Olivia and I have other plans tonight."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia wondered, "He didn't mention any plans for tonight."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was curious and was about to ask but was stopped by Steven. In matters of feelings, she was sometimes quite oblivious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He whispered in her ear, "Diana, they're going on a date. Don't mess it up."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana wanted to say she wasn't messing it up; she just didn't realize they were a couple.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at Olivia and said, "Olivia, let's meet another day. Do you remember what you once told me? May we both meet the one who smiles as soon as they see us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia looked at Cecil.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil smiled at her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia, a bit shy, smiled too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The scene made Diana smile involuntarily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your dishes."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The owner looked at them, served the dishes personally, and left with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil bringing his girlfriend to eat seafood spread online.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The restaurant's business improved as a result.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The owner gave them free shrimp, which Steven and Cecil passed to Diana and Olivia.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two girls were very happy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the late-night snack, they each went home.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was very tired, put the diamond necklace in the safe, and went to take a bath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was very happy tonight, and also very tired!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven saw her forget to take her pajamas and laughed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn&rsquo;t remind her but took their pajamas and walked slowly toward the bathroom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana just wanted to rest quickly after her bath and didn&rsquo;t even realize she had forgotten to bring her pajamas in her rush.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After taking a bath, she realized she hadn&rsquo;t brought her pajamas.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A pink nightgown was handed to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana suddenly looked at Steven and said, "Steven, why did you come in?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She quickly grabbed the nightgown from his hand and put it on.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stared at her body, wanting to take her back to bed quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked, "Diana, why are you hiding?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was a bit shy. She was somewhat surprised by this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head and said, "No... nothing. Go take a shower. I'll wait outside for you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven heard her words and smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, Diana. I'll be right there. Don't fall asleep. There's a glass of milk on the bedside table. Drink it first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thanked him for preparing the milk for her, but she didn't feel like drinking it at the moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven watched her leave and gently said, "Diana, you are the angel sent to me by heaven."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1152.html">« Prev</a><a href="1154.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
