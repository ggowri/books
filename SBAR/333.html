Had Cecil told Rita everything?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Madam Farley, how can you slander me like this? Boo-hoo... Your grandson nearly assaulted me! Boo-hoo... Mr. Foliot, you have to stand up for me," Queenie cried.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Heh... Something happens, and you don't go to your parents or the police, but you come to Jace? Even if you get him to back you up today, I won't let this slide. You drugged my grandson, and I'll hold you accountable for what you did," Rita said firmly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rita's tone was unyielding.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was startled. Rita had ruined her plans.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Boo-hoo... Madam Farley, I was just changing clothes after a waiter spilled wine on me. Your grandson approached me while I was changing, and everyone saw it when they came in.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Besides, why would I seduce your grandson in such a place? If your grandson has no shame and your family has no shame, I still have my reputation to protect.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm young and wouldn't joke about my honor, especially with my movie about to start filming.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why would I do something that ruins my future? I know you're powerful, Madam Farley, and it's easy for you to target a woman like me, but I can't let you frame me. I was nearly assaulted."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie cried pitifully, placing Rita on a high pedestal and making her the target of everyone's attention.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Throughout her life, Rita had been shrewd but always straightforward. This was the first time she had faced someone as shameless as Queenie.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fine! If you want to talk about power, then let's have the police handle this," Rita said, instructing her assistant to call the police.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie, her eyes red with tears, shouted confidently, "Go ahead, Madam Farley, call the police! I'm the victim here. Let's see whether the evidence sways the police toward your powerful family or gives me justice."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If the police sided with the Farley family, the story of their abuse of power would surely trend online, putting the family in the hot seat. Big corporations couldn't withstand such gossip.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana remembered last year when a famous businessman was accused of harassing an employee. The news went viral, and the woman did a live stream. The company's stock plummeted, sales fell by 90%, and within a month, it declared bankruptcy. Diana had seen how terrifying rumors could be.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was imitating this strategy. Her schemes were vicious.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, the wealth of prestigious families was tempting, and everyone wanted a share.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jace and Queenie were likely working together for a piece of the pie.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked at Steven beside her, her eyes filled with rage. Was he part of this too?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven caught sight of her hateful gaze and felt his heart tighten. Remembering how she had hit her head hard, he crouched down and asked, "Does it hurt?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he finished speaking, he reached out to touch Diana's head.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was in pain but still pulled away. "Don't touch me. You're disgusting!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's eyes narrowed. Did she think he was dirty?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, you..." Steven started, but Cecil interrupted him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, Diana..." Cecil called out.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil had finally come to his senses.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's head was swollen, throbbing with pain.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Cecil awake, Diana's eyes reddened as she smiled. "Cecil, are you clear-headed now?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="332.html">« Prev</a><a href="334.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
