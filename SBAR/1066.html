"Diana, investigate Roger. I don't know that woman from last night. I was drunk, and she deliberately took me to the hotel, but I didn't take her there. Check the hotel records. Yes, I was completely drunk last night and couldn't have booked a room. The room was pre-booked by them to frame me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All the reporters were stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A female reporter asked, "Was Mr. Toby framed?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A male reporter replied, "I don't know. But he keeps saying he's innocent. So, he might have been framed, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The female reporter continued to ask, "Can we share the footage we captured?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another male reporter said, "We don't need to do this. Another media outlet live-streamed today's events and didn't give us a chance. I'll start live-streaming next time too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Several reporters kept discussing, some angry, some unwilling to accept it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen had already been taken into the police car. After getting in, Owen kept shouting, "Diana, please help me. I'm begging you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was slightly stunned, thinking, "He actually knows how to beg for help?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After waving at him, Diana watched him leave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen didn't understand what Diana meant by this and looked at her despondently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna looked at Diana. "Diana, are you really going to help that jerk? If he could control himself, he wouldn't have been arrested today."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt Owen made a valid point. "Luna, even though I don't want to save that bastard, he did say something right. If Queenie uses everything she</span><span>'</span><span>s taken against us, we</span><span>'</span><span>ll be in trouble. Why can Queenie repeatedly snatch others' companies? Because her company's black technology is terrifying&mdash;it can turn others' assets into her own within minutes."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie has always been so arrogant for a reason&mdash;because we're not capable enough to find out where her elite team is hiding."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna was shocked and felt that Diana overestimated Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking down at Diana, she said, "Diana, I'll go investigate Roger and his wife right now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since they had decided to save Owen, they needed to act quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head and said, "I'll investigate personally. Queenie's people will definitely destroy all the surveillance. I'll handle the surveillance; you investigate Roger. Owen was just captured, so now is when they're most complacent. Go quickly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright." Luna escorted Diana back to the car and then went to investigate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching Luna leave alone, Evan felt a bit worried. "Mrs. Gellar, where did Luna go?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "She went to investigate Roger."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan was stunned, thinking, "She was just excited to scold Owen, so why the sudden change, now wanting to save Owen?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mrs. Gellar, are you going to save Owen?" Evan couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana didn't want to save him, but she couldn't let Queenie continue to grow. "Yes. I can't let Queenie get stronger."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as she finished speaking, she felt a burning gaze. She turned her head and saw Steven's deep, smiling eyes, momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven thanked her, saying, "Diana, I know Owen's character well. Aside from being a bit arrogant, he's not bad. He will appreciate you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said calmly, "I'm not saving him because of who he is. I don't need his gratitude; I just don't want Queenie to grow stronger."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven didn't expose her, knowing she was soft-hearted and just saying that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright. I'll have someone bail Owen out." Steven picked up his phone and sent a message.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana picked up her phone, took a photo of the hotel's name, then looked at Evan and said, "Evan, let's go back now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan responded, "Alright."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After arriving home, Diana went to her room alone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She took out her phone, contacted Joseph, and sent Owen's photo over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana immediately sent a message: [Joseph, check all his activities from yesterday and everyone who approached him.]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Joseph: [Diana, isn't he the rapist who just appeared in the livestream? Are you going to help him?]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana: [Joseph, I'm helping ourselves. If Queenie keeps growing, we'll all be in trouble. Her elite team will definitely erase the surveillance, but they wouldn't dare to directly tamper with the hotel's footage. So, we need other ways to find evidence. I'm investigating, and you start investigating too. Contact me immediately if you find anything.]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Joseph: [Alright. Diana, don't overwork yourself.]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana: [Alright. You too.]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she sent a cute emoji over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't even notice Steven standing right behind her. "Honey, are you enjoying your chat with him so much?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words startled Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She quickly turned around to look at him. "Why are you here? And why aren't you using your wheelchair again?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana asked two questions at once.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven gazed deeply at her delicate face, feeling helpless. He knew she had the right to make friends. She was outstanding, so there would naturally be many men around her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he still said jealously, "Joseph is really good to you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Diana smiled and said, "Our relationship has always been good.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, why are you still the same as before? You selfishly want me to be generous, then pretend to be clueless to make me feel wronged. I won't accept this anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We're just cooperating now because we have a common enemy. Don't overthink it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's gaze dimmed, but he said nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sat down and started working on her computer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Standing behind her, Steven could only endure the pain in his heart and silently sit beside her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was very familiar with the computer, her fingers swiftly typing on the keyboard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The screen reflected her delicate and focused features, her gaze clear and captivating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her eyes sparkled with intelligence, fixed on the rapidly moving code on the screen, her typing speed as swift as flowing water.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During this time, Steven had been watching Diana work hard on the monitor. Although she looked beautiful like that, the feeling of sitting beside her like this was different.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He watched her working seriously with his own eyes. Her figure was so dazzling that he couldn't look away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the past, Diana would take care of his feelings even when she was busy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, Steven thought that if things could be resolved sooner, they could live a simple and peaceful life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt that Diana cared about him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But after seeing Steven stand up, Queenie came back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Things went beyond his control again, and not being loved by anyone was the safest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven thought, "I've already dragged Mom into hell. I don't want anyone else to get hurt."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quietly looking at Diana, Steven smiled and thought, "But now things have taken a turn. There's still hope for everything."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A few minutes later, Diana opened the video. Many videos from the hotel surveillance were accessible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mm... Ah! You're hurting me. Slow down," a moan was heard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was shocked and said, "What kind of hotel is this?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1065.html">« Prev</a><a href="1067.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
