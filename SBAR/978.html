He's been gone for four whole years. This year, he actually messaged me and even sent me a gift. My birthday is in just over two months, and I want Tobias, Julius, and Hubery to celebrate it with me this year."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna always thought Hubery could be too stubborn sometimes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Back then, watching Diana suffer and yet remain so stubborn, Hubery had left the country in a fit of anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, Hubery is too headstrong. But since he messaged you, he'll definitely come back for your birthday. It's been four years. Whatever anger he had should have subsided by now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna was sure Hubery would never truly refuse to forgive Diana. After all, he cared about her too much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He simply couldn't stand to see Diana give up her life and dreams for the sake of her family. Years ago, she had the chance to go abroad for further studies. If it hadn't been for the Marsh family, Diana might have become a titan in the business world by now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled faintly. She truly hoped Hubery would return. She hadn't seen him or Julius for three years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Julius occasionally video-called her, but their conversations were always short, ending abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana chuckled lightly and said, "Luna, Hubery loves seafood. When March comes, let's go diving for crabs. If I catch them myself and cook them for him, he'll be thrilled."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing that Diana would cook for him personally, Luna couldn't help feeling a bit envious of Hubery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, even if you just bought them, as long as you're the one cooking, he'd still be overjoyed. Trust me, I know him too well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana chuckled, her mood noticeably lifting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they arrived at the company building, Luna got out first to retrieve the wheelchair from the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The chill outside was biting. Luna wrapped her coat tightly around herself before carefully helping Diana out of the car. She seated her in the wheelchair and covered her legs with a thin blanket.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shivered slightly. It wasn't snowing anymore, but the cold was sharper than ever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked up at the Gellar Group building standing tall under the winter sun. It was a landmark of Capitole and the dream workplace for many graduates.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the past, she had only wished to be a part of it, but now, it was hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled, marveling at the unpredictability of life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna urged, "Diana, let's go inside. It's freezing out here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana nodded. "Alright. By the way, Luna, Olivia said she's coming back today. I'll ask what time her flight lands, and we'll go pick her up. If there's an event tonight, let Nolan handle it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing Olivia was returning, Luna grinned. "That's great. With Olivia back, you won't feel so alone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew Olivia always had a way of lifting Diana's spirits.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Olivia traveled frequently for work, and Luna wasn't sure how long she'd stay this time. She hoped it would be a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Got it, Diana. By the way, is that Ms. Barnes in the lobby?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's gaze snapped to the lobby, and sure enough, it was Paula. She was dressed in a black down coat, her hair neatly pinned up. Her elegance remained untouched. Diana resembled Paula so much, but she didn't take after Jeff at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The first time Diana met Paula, she realized that even though Paula was her biological mother, she neither liked nor cared for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana sighed inwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought to herself, "What is she doing here?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She made things so final back then. If she meant what she said, she shouldn't be here now. It's better for both of us that way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula's heart ached when she saw Diana in a wheelchair. She had heard about the accident. Diana had been in Steven's car the night it happened. Paula had wanted to see her but feared Diana wouldn't want her there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew she had failed miserably as a mother. She didn't even know where her daughter lived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She only knew Diana would be at work on January 8th, so she waited here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, how's your leg?" Paula asked, her voice full of concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana felt nothing toward her show of care. She replied indifferently, "Ms. Barnes, I'm fine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her coldness pierced Paula's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana knew there was nothing left to say between them. Once, she had desperately craved her mother's love. Paula had known how much Diana longed for her approval, yet she had chosen to treat her in the cruelest way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tears welled up in Paula's eyes. "Diana, I'm sorry! I was wrong."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shook her head. "It doesn't matter, Ms. Barnes. You and I have nothing to do with each other. I know you've always looked down on me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Honestly, I don't understand you. Queenie did so many things to harm me, and you just turned a blind eye. I thought you'd accept everything about her. I thought even if you found out she was Amelie's biological daughter, you'd still protect her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But now I see your love was never real. It was just a way to make yourself feel good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can you stop showing up in my life? Seeing you only makes me angry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana closed her eyes, trying to suppress the rage and pain clawing at her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was her biological mother. Even if she loved her a little, she wouldn't say something like that to her. Diana hated her, she couldn't stand by and watch Queenie destroy her. After all, Paula gave her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought people were like this. When love faded, all that was left was hate. Now, every time she saw Paula, she felt not just anger but also a sharp urge to hurt her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hated this feeling but couldn't stop herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew no one would treat another person well forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But it was hard to accept that her mother only ever looked at her with disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula broke into sobs. Every night, she was haunted by memories of her past mistakes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But there was one thing she had to tell Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, if you want to know the reason, I can tell you. But it has to be just the two of us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked at her tear-streaked face, puzzled. "Reason? What reason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula took a shaky breath. "You've always thought I didn't love you. Once I tell you the reason, you'll understand."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana let out a cold laugh. "What other reason could there be? You hated me because I was just a country girl who embarrassed you, didn't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula shook her head fervently. Seeing the mockery in Diana's eyes, her heart shattered. "No, Diana, that's not it. Though, yes, I did look down on you at first. I thought Queenie was the daughter I had spent half my life raising. I did favor her, and that was my fault.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I admit I was shallow. But there's another reason, a much bigger one."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana frowned. Paula didn't seem to be lying. "What reason?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="977.html">« Prev</a><a href="979.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
