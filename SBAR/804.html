Come on, eat up,&quot; Steven said suddenly, pulling her out of her thoughts.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana held up the lobster in her hand. &quot;I&#x27;m eating, see?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She loved seafood, while Steven typically ate lighter meals.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After two years of a bland diet, indulging in some delicious food lately felt like a breath of fresh air.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After just one lobster, she was already feeling satisfied.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The freshness was incredible, and a smile spread across her face as she savored every bite.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven watched her enjoy the meal, a small smile playing on his lips.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He knew how easily she could be pleased.</p><p style="text-align:left;">They ate in comfortable silence, both absorbed in their food.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Once dinner was over, Diana felt a warmth blossoming in her chest, filling her with happiness.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Standing up, she said, &quot;Thanks for dinner. I&#x27;m full.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Politeness was important to her, and she always made it a point to express her gratitude.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Glad to hear it,&quot; Steven replied, a sense of contentment lingering from the evening. Just then, his phone buzzed on the table.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He glanced at the screen and saw it was Evan calling.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Yes?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mr. Gellar, our report didn&#x27;t work. Queenie&#x27;s company managed to weather the storm. The evidence we provided doesn&#x27;t match their data, and the system shows no signs of tax evasion. Now, they&#x27;re threatening to investigate who framed them.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven&#x27;s brow furrowed. It seemed like Queenie had some powerful allies.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He had known her long enough to realize she had some tricks up her sleeve.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He had underestimated her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Find out who&#x27;s backing Queenie,&quot; he instructed before hanging up.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He glanced at Diana, aware she had more insight into the situation.</p><p style="text-align:left;">When she heard him mention investigating Queenie, her eyes immediately locked onto his.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I asked Evan to report on Queenie&#x27;s company with solid evidence, but they managed to deflect it. It looks like there&#x27;s a big player behind them,&quot; Steven explained.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana&#x27;s eyes widened in surprise. Something about Steven felt different today, and her guard went up.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Noticing her unease, Steven raised an eyebrow. &quot;Why are you so suspicious? I haven&#x27;t done anything to you. I told you I&#x27;d help you with Queenie...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Hold on there, Mr. Gellar. Fewer words and more action, please. I know how you work. You say one thing and do another. I&#x27;ve had enough of your tricks to trust you now.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Diana,&quot; he said, a hint of frustration in his voice.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She didn&#x27;t respond but instead called for someone to come clean the room.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Once the cleaner left, she headed to her bedroom to call Luna.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven followed her, but just as he reached for the door, he caught her on the phone.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Luna, I need you to look into the company managed by Felicity under Queenie&#x27;s name. Check if they are involved in tax evasion.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;And check on Queenie&#x27;s computer skills. She&#x27;s talented, but she shouldn&#x27;t be able to handle the tax issues on her own. Find out if she recently hired any top-notch hacker from a school to work for her. And make it quick.&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="803.html">« Prev</a><a href="805.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
