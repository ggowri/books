It was quite the spectacle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She felt a surge of satisfaction. She had really let them have it today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had stayed quiet before, giving them too much respect. Looking back, it was infuriating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Today's mess was definitely Queenie's idiotic idea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana glanced up. Sure enough, she saw Queenie standing in the crowd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana smiled at her, a clear look of provocation in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie was dumbfounded. Could Diana really talk like this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">These reporters were known for asking sharp and tricky questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But none of that seemed to work on Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The atmosphere turned tense in an instant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The reporters were shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Looking at Diana, who was both fierce and elegant, the two words running through their minds were "it's over."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was stunningly beautiful, and just standing there made her the center of attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Filled with jealousy, Queenie walked over and gave her a worried look. "Diana, you have to own up to your mistakes. Selling out your soul and principles isn't shameful, especially since you like Mr. Gall!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Ha... let me add to that. What's shameful isn't selling out your soul, it's not getting a good price for it. You've already sold yourself well, so why are you still bothering me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I like Harry? Huh, I don't even know who he is! You and Harry are the ones who've been sharing a bed, and yet you're accusing me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie's face turned ghostly pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, you... you're lying."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana suddenly pointed toward where Steven was standing. "Wait, that tall guy over there. Why does he look familiar? Oh, right, he looks like the trash I threw out yesterday."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana had spotted Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That last sentence was directed at Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was just standing there, minding his own business, and still got dragged into it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana had misunderstood him again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie blinked in frustration, tears threatening to fall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, what's happened to you? I always thought you were so mild-mannered, why have you suddenly changed?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana glanced at her. "Oh, here we go again! Do you always pull this trick? Will it kill you to stop pretending? Yes, I'm patient, but why should I put up with you?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Oh, go on, keep acting. I love watching you finish your performance. Keep going. Look, that lady over there is live-streaming. Perfect! Now everyone can see your poor little innocent act. You like performing, don't you? Perfect time to practice your acting skills. Let the audience get a good look at that face of yours."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie froze, her expression blank as she looked at the woman holding up her phone for the livestream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana... Diana, how did you become like this? How did you get so cruel...?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Cruel? Queenie, do you want me to show everyone how you seduce men? Let me tell you, the public isn't blind. You can fool some desperate guy, but you're not fooling the rest of us.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Then again, every time you see me, you can't help but act out. Go ahead, give it your best shot. Everyone's just here to watch you make a fool of yourself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"At least you're serving a purpose. You're entertaining everyone!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ugh, she'd been too kind before, and now everyone was spoiled rotten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Once people start spiraling down, they can't stop themselves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie had gone too far to turn back now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was too obsessed with power and money. Between love and wealth, love could be discarded, but money was her whole life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie always provoked her for one reason, being loved gave her confidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana wasn't loved or coddled, which is why she had grown so sharp and defensive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Boohoo..." Queenie burst into tears, overwhelmed with frustration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, the woman's livestream gained over ten thousand viewers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Isn't that Queenie, the pianist? She plays so beautifully. Looks like someone's bullying her."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="141.html">« Prev</a><a href="143.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
