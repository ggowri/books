How could you lie to me like this? How dare you deceive me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as the video started, Jeff's anguished voice filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at Helen, who was equally stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, with a sly smile, Helen leaned in and whispered, "Oh, Diana, I have to hear this. Does Jeff have another son out there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nodded. "Yeah, he's been living overseas. I think Paula might have dug into it. I had a suspicion, but I didn't realize it was actually true."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Behind them, Steven suddenly spoke up. "Diana, I want to see this too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glanced at him. "Alright, go ahead and turn on the TV. You might find it interesting. Your fianc&eacute;e's mom has some pretty deep secrets."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven frowned, realizing she was intentionally trying to get under his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Helen just chuckled, not coming to his defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's face darkened as he walked over to the TV. The video was 20 minutes long, and Diana figured it would be more comfortable to watch it on the bigger screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The video began with Amelie preventing Jeff from doing a paternity test.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Queenie showed up, followed by Paula and Eric, and eventually, Tracey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It became clear that Noah was not Jeff's son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After watching the video, Helen was stunned. She sighed and patted Diana's hand. "Diana, your mother... she's had it tough. Jeff is a real piece of work. Does he really want to take everything for himself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, secrets never stay buried forever. They always find a way to come out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's expression darkened slightly, but she smiled lightly. "Grandma, Paula did it willingly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it hadn't been for her warning back then, Paula's parents would have ended up losing everything, their company, their daughter, and their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In a way, Diana felt she'd already repaid her debt to Paula for bringing her into this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Helen looked pained, wanting to say something but holding back. Paula was also a victim in this, and so was Diana. Who knows what the future holds for this girl?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Behind it all was a huge conspiracy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was why Edward had insisted that Steven marry Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, are you really not going to forgive your mother?" Helen asked softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head firmly, her voice resolute. "Grandma, I can't forget the hurt she caused me. I've already told her everything I planned to do to Queenie. I've repaid her for giving me life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She saved the Barnes family, and to her, that was enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her biological parents meant little to her, and she didn't want to force anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, you've been through so much. There are more secrets in these wealthy families than you can imagine. Things worse than this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Helen's eyes were filled with regret, as if she needed a resolution, some closure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wanted the truth to come to light too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana understood that, so she didn't push further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven studied her closely. If she couldn't forgive her own mother, then she might not forgive him either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A knot tightened in his chest, the discomfort almost unbearable. He wanted to walk away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He never intended to drag her into this mess, but the moment she married him, she was already a part of it. He hadn't thought it through before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Madam Gellar, Mr. and Mrs. Gellar, lunch is served," Candice called from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana helped Helen up and smiled warmly. "Grandma, let's go eat. After lunch, is there anything you'd like to do? I'll go with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Helen's eyes softened, and she smiled back, clearly in a good mood. "How about a little walk after we eat? You two can head home after dinner, alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course!" Diana agreed, her voice light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They sat down for lunch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Helen only ate a little, mostly light dishes, but she'd made sure to prepare some spicy food for Diana, knowing it was her favorite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana ate happily, savoring each bite as the warm atmosphere filled the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once lunch was finished, Diana stood and offered her arm to Helen. It was cold outside, so she guided her to the glasshouse in the backyard for a walk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven quietly followed behind, listening to their conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had always known that Diana had an extraordinary amount of patience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When she was with Helen, it was obvious how happy she made her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a half-hour stroll, Helen began to sweat but felt rejuvenated. She looked over at Steven, who had been following them silently, and said, "Steven, go get me two cups of hot chocolate from the caf&eacute; on West Street. Diana likes it, too, so bring one for her. Hurry up, now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She waved her hand, her smile full of warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven understood that Helen wanted to send him away for a while. He wasn't sure what they needed to talk about, but he didn't ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright," he said, giving Diana a lingering glance before he turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once Helen saw him walk off, she turned to Diana with a beaming smile. "Diana, don't you think Steven has changed a lot recently?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nodded slightly. "Yes, he has."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wasn't sure what Helen was trying to get at, but she wasn't ready to forgive Steven, not yet, and maybe not ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unless some kind of miracle happened and it turned out that he wasn't the one who had betrayed her in her previous life, she couldn't bring herself to forgive him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter how many lives they went through, the answer would stay the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Helen gestured for her to sit on the couch. The warmth from the air conditioning made the room feel cozy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, the hurt Steven caused you... part of it is real, but part of it isn't. You cared for him for two whole years. During that time, it was you who brought him warmth. Don't you see that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Andrew always wanted to kill him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana froze. She hadn't expected Helen to bring this up. This had always been a mystery to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grandma, I know about it. Steven had a few accidents in the past. Were all of them his fault? Why would he try to kill his own son?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Helen sighed deeply. "It's a long story, one that even Steven doesn't fully understand. I don't know how to explain it to you, but trust me when I say this. Steven is a good person at heart. He knows the truth about Queenie now. He won't be fooled by her anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana could tell Helen was trying to get her to forgive Steven. But she just couldn't do it, not after everything that had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her past life, Steven couldn't even let his father go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had been mentally unstable, his moods swinging between erratic and calm, and she had never known which side of him was real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had hurt her deeply, pushing her down the stairs, causing her grandfather's and brother's deaths. She hated him for it. And no matter what happened now, she couldn't forget the pain he had caused her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Steven died in front of Queenie in her previous life, she thought she was finally free from them, that the torment was over. But now, here she was again. She had no idea why she was given a second chance, but she couldn't deny the bitterness in her heart.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="894.html">« Prev</a><a href="896.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
