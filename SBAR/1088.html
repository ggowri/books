She had just woken up and was still groggy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had just yawned, her sleepy eyes so adorable that he couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t help but want to kiss her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven reached out to wipe the tear from the corner of her eye and said gently, "Sweetheart, I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t do anything to you. Why are you crying?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana froze, looking at his smiling face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was getting more and more skilled at saying sweet, tender words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled and slowly sat up straight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a good sleep, she felt completely refreshed and stretched lazily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven steadied her. She asked, "Steven, since when did you learn to joke around?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To her, Steven was as cold as an emotionless robot, hardly ever joking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled, "Everything</span><span>'</span><span>s settled. No more threats, no more danger. My mood</span><span>'</span><span>s changed, so I can finally say what I want."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana froze, thinking, "Just how oppressed has he been, that he couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t even speak freely?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had been a pampered child growing up. Except for the past few years, she had always basked in the love of her brother and grandfather.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had never been through what he had. It was only after Helen told her about his childhood that Diana felt such sympathy for him, and love.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana wanted to give him hope, to help him live a better life. Even if he was always cold and distant, she still greeted him with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back then, her thoughts were simple&mdash;she just wanted him to stay alive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the boat docked. Steven drove off the ship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glanced around and said, "Isn't this the island you bought for Queenie? Why did you bring me here? Are you trying to show me how much you adore her?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana mocked him on purpose, but when she turned, she caught the sadness in Steven's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew perfectly well that he bought this island because of her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana instantly regretted what she had just said and fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When they were together, the past was something they could never bring up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whenever the past was mentioned, she would always break down, always end up mocking Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The pain, the humiliation she once endured&mdash;Diana found it hard to forget.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, she was going to live for herself. She wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t let them hurt her again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stayed silent. He knew she couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t let go of the past, but he was determined to make her feel his love.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The car quickly pulled up in front of the seaside villa.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven unlocked his phone, using the remote app to open the villa</span><span>'</span><span>s gate, then drove straight into the garage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The March wind was still chilly, especially on the island. The coconut trees swayed and rustled in the breeze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every now and then, they could hear the sound of coconuts hitting the ground.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The wind was really strong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana suddenly asked curiously, "Why are we at the beach this time of year? It's freezing!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "The villa has heating. We</span><span>'</span><span>ll be warm once we</span><span>'</span><span>re inside. Didn</span><span>'</span><span>t you say you wanted barbecue and beer? I had everything prepared. We can eat soon."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was surprised to see him respond to her so normally.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "Could it be that now everything</span><span>'</span><span>s out in the open, his mindset has changed, and he</span><span>'</span><span>s acting like a normal person again?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The impact of the environment is really scary. But this version of Steven is pretty nice."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana opened the car door and stepped out. The wind was strong. She quickly ran toward the villa.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven got out of the car and followed right behind her. He quickly opened the villa door and turned on the heat. The room gradually started to warm up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven knew Diana was always cold.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He pulled her to sit on the couch, grabbed the thin blanket nearby, and draped it over her shoulders.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thanks!" Diana said with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her tenderly and said, "Let</span><span>'</span><span>s go to the restaurant, have some barbecue, and drink beer."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at him and said, "I don</span><span>'</span><span>t think you really want a drink right now. You just want to talk to me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Neither of them liked drinking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they ended up sleeping together after drinking, she would be the only one regretting it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t until she arrived at the Marsh Villa that she realized how dark some people</span><span>'</span><span>s minds could be&mdash;all thanks to Paula and her crew.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven pulled Diana into the kitchen to grab something to eat. He really did want to talk to her&mdash;and seriously win her over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Given the chance, he would make sure to be with the one he loved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at his smiling face. This side of Steven&mdash;gentle and refined&mdash;completely made her heart skip a beat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His face was her absolute favorite.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was undeniably handsome, but the way Steven made her feel was completely different.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil and Joseph were good-looking too, but in her heart, Steven was still the most handsome.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the table in the restaurant sat a grill pan and marinated meat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana spotted her favorite shrimp and suddenly felt a little hungry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She figured grilling here would leave the villa filled with smoke.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was freezing outside, and she didn</span><span>'</span><span>t feel like sitting out there for a barbecue.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "Steven, help me out. Forget the barbecue. I</span><span>'</span><span>ll cook something else."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven backed her up. "Alright!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glanced around and spotted an apron on the chair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She walked over, picked up the apron, tied it on, and checked the ingredients. There was fish, shrimp, crab, along with cabbage and tomatoes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She decided to make vegetable soup, seafood, and a salad.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana finished cooking in just half an hour.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She even made pasta for Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They sat across from each other. Steven pulled out a bottle of red wine, poured two glasses, and handed one to Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She served him some vegetable soup and told him to start with that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven knew Diana had this habit when it came to cooking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She loved having soup.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vegetable soup, chicken soup&mdash;she loved them both.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven picked up the vegetable soup and took a sip. Her influence had made him love soup too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After finishing the soup, they both felt warm inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They didn</span><span>'</span><span>t say a word, quietly eating their food.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven cracked the crab for Diana, letting her focus on eating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After finishing the shrimp and crab, Diana felt full.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She put down her utensils and went to wash her hands.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven followed her to wash his hands too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When they returned, Steven grabbed a bottle of red wine and led Diana to the room upstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana went to freshen up, while Steven sat in the bedroom upstairs, waiting for her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glanced at the crashing waves outside the window, then shifted his gaze toward the bathroom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a while, he got up and headed to take a shower too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Half an hour later, they emerged from the bathroom into the room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana picked up the glass of red wine, handed it to Steven, and smiled. "Cheers."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1087.html">« Prev</a><a href="1089.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
