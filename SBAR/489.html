After taking the pills, his manhood came through, and he and Amelie fooled around several rounds. But deep down, he knew this was more frightening&mdash;his situation would only deteriorate from here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We still need to wait a little longer, Amelie. Paula's company is in trouble. She's racked up billions of dollars in debt, and our daughter is already working on acquiring her company. Once we complete the acquisition, we'll be able to walk away clean," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was stunned and looked at Jeff in shock. "She's in debt? How is that possible? Isn't Paula great at running a business? How could she suddenly be in the red? She's been acting crazy every time she sees me lately&mdash;could she have found out about something?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff shook his head and replied, "No. She had her suspicions before, but I've already assured her. Azure Group suddenly pulled out their investment, and with business being tough lately, Paula's company couldn't keep up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, she'll sell her parents' properties at a low price, and when our daughter buys them up for cheap, the entire Barnes family will be ours. Our daughter and son&mdash;they're the real winners here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for those four idiots, they're either dead or crippled. They're no threat to us anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie sneered, "I've waited over 20 years, and finally, this day has come."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelie, I know you've endured a lot over the years. But don't worry, from now on, things are only going to get better for us." Jeff reassured her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie smiled smugly, "We have Paula to thank for this. If it weren't for her, we wouldn't be living such a happy life. That foolish woman is still out there, working hard and making money for us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff scoffed, "That stupid woman is crazy about me. I throw a little tantrum, and she immediately feels sorry for me. By the next day, she's already bought me a watch worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. All I have to do is say a few sweet words, and she's completely overwhelmed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie, visibly excited, tugged on his arm. "Honey, once you divorce her, we'll get a new villa. The wealthy ladies that I know all live in bigger ones than mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff smirked and said, "Alright, alright. Once we've taken all of Paula's assets, I'll buy you a four-story villa&mdash;pool, movie theater, anything you want.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've always wanted to travel abroad, right? You've been jealous of your friends who get to do that. When our son's company goes public, we'll have plenty of money. I'll take you wherever you want, and we can stay as long as you like."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was nearly in tears with excitement. "Finally, Jeff! After everything I've been through, this time you won't betray me again and let that awful Paula keep you for so long. She's been so unfair to me! If she doesn't give me part of her property, she'll be the one at fault."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. Everything will be yours. We've been together since we were kids. If my family wasn't in such a bad situation, I never would've let you suffer like this." Jeff pulled her tightly into his arms. He really did owe Amelie. Because his family wasn't well off, he had no choice but to play the role of the perfect husband for Paula while secretly using their family to get ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With guilt in his eyes, Jeff said, "Amelie, I'm sorry for everything. I married another woman, forced you to live in the shadows all these years, and still made you bear my children. But don't worry, I won't ever let you down again. Gale and Frank are out of the way, and next, we'll deal with Eric. Eric and Dylan are practically ruined now. We're so close to success. Queenie's doing well. We have to stay under the radar and not hold her back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not far away, Eric overheard everything and was so furious he almost charged at Jeff. Eric thought angrily, "How can he live off someone else and still be this shameless? Now he wants to kill me and my brothers too? What a bastard."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="488.html">« Prev</a><a href="490.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
