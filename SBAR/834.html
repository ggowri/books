Also, look into the list of partners under Felicity's company. I want a report within three days," Steven commanded, his tone leaving no room for argument.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan diligently noted everything down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it, Mr. Gellar. I'll make sure it's done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good. And push the meeting back by an hour. I need a break," Steven replied, a hint of satisfaction in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan noticed the slight lift in Steven's mood and couldn't help but smile as he quickly exited the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that if Steven was in a good place, everyone around him felt the ripple effects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Settling down on the sofa, Steven pulled out his phone and dialed a friend overseas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I spent over a hundred million to see Queenie's true colors. What a waste! I, Steven, am no saint. I absolutely despise being duped."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other end, his friend Ron Potter replied, "What's got you calling me out of the blue?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a grin, Steven said, "Ron, I need your help designing a one-of-a-kind engagement ring for my wife."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ron's surprise was palpable. "Mr. Gellar, you're married?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fond smile crept onto Steven's face as he thought of Diana's vibrant face. "Yes, and I'll introduce you to her soon. I'll personally source the diamond for the ring."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perfect! I could use some quality stones. If you're on the hunt, that saves me a lot of trouble. I'll have the design ready for you in ten days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sounds great!" Steven replied enthusiastically, standing up and moving to the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He began discussing his ideas with Ron, animatedly outlining his vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Diana received a call from Lily, who had just been discharged from the hospital. Lily warmly invited her to dinner at her home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn't refuse, so she agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After working for a couple of hours in the office, she took Luna with her to buy a gift for Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they drove, Luna asked, "Diana, what do you think Mrs. Foliot wants? Is it just a casual dinner?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "I'm not sure. We'll find out when we get there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought to herself, "Lily always has an agenda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone like her, who can't stand to lose, won't easily let Mark and Amelie off the hook."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna inquired, "So where are we getting the gift?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana pondered for a moment. "Let's go to one of Steven's luxury stores. If we're giving a gift, it has to be something classy from his shops. That'll definitely make an impression."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had to admit Steven was incredibly successful in business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," Luna said, and she drove them to the mall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once there, Diana picked out a stylish scarf and a chic coat for Lily, along with some health supplements for her parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After shopping, they headed downstairs to the shoe section in the lobby when Diana suddenly spotted Amelie and Jean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna said, her voice dripping with disdain, "Look over there, Diana. That heartless Jean is already out shopping with Amelie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glanced over and replied, "Let's not get involved. We should just keep moving."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as they took a step away, Amelie's impatient voice rang out. "Jean, didn't I tell you? These shoes are ridiculously expensive! Why do you insist on buying them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jean was taken aback, looking at Amelie with confusion. "When we came here before, you didn't say that. You said a pretty girl like me should wear nice shoes. What's with the sudden change in attitude?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in Jean's eyes. To her, it felt like her mother had abandoned her, leaving only Amelie by her side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie's irritation deepened, making Jean's heart sink even further.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="833.html">« Prev</a><a href="835.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
