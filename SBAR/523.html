I'm your grandmother! You worthless child, how dare you speak to me like that!" Tracey rolled her eyes in anger. She thought, "This worthless kid never had the guts to talk to me like this before. He used to be so respectful. Gale is still the best. He is dedicated, shrewd, and capable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric sneered, his gaze icy as he stared at Tracey. "Worthless? Grandma, I'm your grandson. How could you call me that?" He thought, "Is it because Queenie and Jeff are about to succeed that she can't even be bothered to keep up the act anymore?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tracey was taken aback but quickly softened her tone. "Eric, I'm just worried about Jeff and said something without thinking. Please don't hold it against me. I don't know anything. Isn't Paula the one who can do it all? Everyone says Paula is a master in the business world while Jeff is a failure. I'm just upset."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Tracey finished speaking, she lowered her head and wiped away her tears. She cursed inwardly, "Damn it, I'm too anxious. I'll teach Paula a proper lesson once her empire crumbles. That woman's words are unbearable. It's enough to drive me mad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric smirked inwardly. "Jeff is indeed a failure who sponges off others." But he didn't say a word. The time wasn't right yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric turned and stormed out loudly as if he were furious. But once he stepped outside, he quietly slipped back in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, Queenie's hushed voice could be heard. "Grandma, what's really going on with Dad?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tracey frowned at Queenie's question and replied, somewhat embarrassed, "Your dad seems to be having an issue with erections. Lately, he's been seeing Amelie at night and taking pills. The doctor said he's overdoing it, and his body can't handle it. On top of that, he has high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high blood sugar. He collapsed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff's health had been acting up more frequently these days. The doctor warned that if Jeff didn't get it under control, sudden death could be a real possibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It really scared Tracey. Her only source of support was Jeff, and he was outstanding. Ever since Jeff married Paula, the Marsh family had become billionaires.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Jeff died, Tracey's life would be a joke, and she'd be stuck living in misery. Just thinking about it made the future seem so bleak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was stunned as she looked at Jeff's pale face. "He... he really..." She was at a loss for words. "Did Paula come back to cause trouble?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tacey said, "No, I was just saying it to Eric. Word is, Paula's company lost more investors again. The business is about to collapse. I'm trying to push Jeff to get rid of it while he still can. If Paula is buried in debt, it'll be the perfect time for Jeff to divorce her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelie just called Jeff, telling him to hurry to have you return those 200 million dollars. The company is barely hanging on, and now that the money's already in your pocket, you can't give it back to her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tracey's eyes gleamed with greed. She thought, "Two hundred million dollars is an astronomical sum. Paula's company is on the verge of bankruptcy anyway, so what difference does it make? That money would be far better spent on my own retirement."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandma, I'll handle this. You don't need to worry. Just take care of Dad. As for the divorce, let me acquire Paula's company first. Then, we'll force her to divorce Dad." Queenie figured Amelie deserved to stand proudly by Jeff's side. After all these years, Amelie had suffered enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paula and her family owe my mother too much. If Paula hadn't stolen my dad, how could she have lived such a happy life for all these years?" Queenie was fuming. She figured Paula must have panicked to the point of dragging Jeff into this mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the door, Eric nearly exploded in anger as he overheard their conversation. Queenie's shamelessness was beyond anything he had ever imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Inside, Tracey was shocked. "Queenie, you're planning to buy Paula's company?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="522.html">« Prev</a><a href="524.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
