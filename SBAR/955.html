"Yanson, you bullied me all through high school, but it wasn't because I was weak. I just didn't want to let a loser like you ruin my future. Now I've graduated from a top university, running a great company with a bright future ahead of me. And you're just sitting there, living off your family's money, doing nothing. I'm doing just fine. You're the one who's pathetic, always picking on the weak."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson froze, staring at Ethan in shock. He never imagined he came off as someone who bullied others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He always thought of himself as a righteous person. He'd only bullied Diana because he couldn't stand how she'd schemed against Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, Diana, being from the countryside, didn't deserve to be on the same level as Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought he was justified, and anything bad he did back then was just youthful ignorance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ethan, I know I messed up in high school, but today, I'm not bullying anyone. You all shouldn't let that conniving woman trick you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's the one who stole the Gellar family business, and she's the one who plotted against Queenie. A woman like that, full of schemes, deserves to be condemned by everyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan sneered, clearly enjoying Yanson's discomfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yanson, is it that you can't stand the fact that Diana took the Gellar family's business from you, or is it that you've lost your backer and can't handle it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, Ms. Bishop is way more impressive than you. She's a thousand times better than someone like you, and she's far superior to that scheming woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie stole Diana's designs to enter a competition. You all saw it happen, but you're too scared to confront it, so you pretend you didn't."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was surprised. She didn't expect Ethan to know all of this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson had been managing Steven's company abroad. He only came back for Christmas, but before he knew it, he was kicked out. Of course, he wasn't happy about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, Diana had used underhanded methods to take the company from them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ethan's words crushed his pride, tramping it into the dirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson couldn't wrap his head around why Steven's grandparents would make an agreement like that, handing over everything Steven had built to Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was furious but didn't dare say why. He didn't want to ruin Steven or Queenie's reputation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan, watching him struggle to respond, pressed on, his words sharp. "Yanson, your family owes everything to the Gellar family. Without them, how long do you think your little businesses can keep going?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that Diana holds the power in the Gellar family, you can't get anything from her, so your true nature shows. You think you're some kind of hero, but it's all in your head."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's words were sharp, his eyes cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson was speechless. He'd always looked down on Ethan, but Ethan also thought he was nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn't believe it either. She never imagined Yanson had been a bully in high school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan continued, mocking him, "Yanson, you're just Queenie's lackey. We were in the same class, and because my grades were better than hers, you couldn't stand me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, that scheming woman, cries to you in front of everyone, and suddenly, you all start treating me like the enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yanson, do you believe in karma? I do," Ethan laughed coldly as he turned and walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt like she'd just gotten a major gossip scoop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson stood there, stunned, watching Ethan leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ethan, what are you talking about? Queenie is kind-hearted. If she hadn't vouched for you, would you even be standing here?" he yelled, but Ethan just walked away, his steps confident and final.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Bishop." Nick stepped out of the elevator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glanced over at him, then waved to Barry, signaling him to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nick, take me to the lounge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Ms. Bishop." Nick gently pushed Diana toward the lounge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana..." Yanson called out from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana </span><span>turned,</span><span> her expression cold. "Yanson, you should be grateful that I didn't go through with that phone call earlier. If you keep pushing me, I'll call the police. You were the one who shoved me first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson opened his mouth, but no words came out. He could only glare at her in frustration as she turned and walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to beg, to apologize, but his pride wouldn't let him. He stood there, helpless, watching her leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the lounge, Kara was still shaken, her body tense. She hugged herself, clearly on edge, too afraid to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd never been so terrified in her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her teacher had promised to bring her to a company to sign a contract, but when she arrived, there were a few men in the room, and their eyes were anything but kind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last thing she expected was for her own teacher to be the one pressuring her to take her clothes off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She loved jewelry design and trusted her teacher to connect her with a legitimate </span><span>company, but she didn't expect it to be a trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her teacher's ulterior motives and the unfair contract made her feel angry and helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd been trying to escape her toxic home life, only to nearly fall into another pit of danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would never sign that contract, not even if it cost her everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her tremble, Luna moved closer, offering reassurance. "Don't worry. I'm here. No one's getting through this door to hurt you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kara's face was pale, her lips quivering as she tried to hold it together. The fear was overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was just a college student, unprepared for the ugliness of the world. She had spent all her time in the safe, sheltered environment of school, completely unaware of the darkness that lurked in people's hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What had happened tonight was beyond anything she could have imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shivering, she told Luna everything. Once she finished, Luna's face twisted in anger. She was furious that people could be so vile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kara, still filled with worry, asked, "Are you sure they won't find us here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna's voice was firm, reassuring. "Don't worry. They won't find us. My friend is on the way, and once you change, we'll get you out of here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kara could only hope they were telling the truth. She had no energy left to run or fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When there was a knock on the door, Kara froze, eyes wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna walked over to open it, and in walked Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana, with Nick standing at the door, walked over to Kara and handed her a set of clothes. "Go change in the back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kara felt the kindness in her gesture and smiled, though her words failed her. She took the clothes silently and went to change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few minutes later, Kara emerged in a stunning high-end outfit. As a designer, she recognized the value of the clothes immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she felt Diana's generosity, her anxiety began to settle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Diana, her voice trembling slightly. "Thank you so much for saving me tonight. Can I ask what's your name?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="954.html">« Prev</a><a href="956.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
