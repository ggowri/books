The heart-wrenching memories from her past life still echoed in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain of being crushed to pieces lingered, seared into her memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment she saw this man, fear gripped her soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he had ruthlessly pushed her down the stairs, his vicious gaze was like that of a devil from hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana quickly masked her emotions, regaining composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Queenie could see the lingering feelings Diana still had for Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been willing to sacrifice everything for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as Diana still had feelings for Steven, it was her weakness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned her head, smiling sweetly as she looked at George. "You're right. All of this is something I chose willingly, and now I am also willingly bearing the consequences. I can give you a chance at light, but I can also send you back into darkness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would make this man experience the pain of being blind and unable to stand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his eyes were blinded, he would never have the chance to push her down the stairs again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This jerk was her nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furthermore, the car accident that happened to Steven back then was also something they had arranged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George roared, "Diana, you're completely crazy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snapped, pushing Queenie forward to the exit. He never wanted to experience blindness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana watched him, her eyes filled with strange mockery. Was Queenie blind? This man didn't care for her as much as Steven cared for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did it feel like Queenie was always picking up peanuts and losing watermelons?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana and the others didn't continue bothering with Queenie and went downstairs together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several people went to the lobby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as they reached the door, Levi charged in from outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were full of rage, glaring fiercely at Queenie. He no longer resembled the charming star he once was. Instead, he looked like a devil straight from hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, you bitch!" Levi yelled. "It was you who seduced me back then. What gives you the right to treat me like this? What gives you the right to blacklist me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had just received the news that his contract had been terminated, and the company that had canceled it was now under Queenie's control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news struck him like a thunderclap. In his eyes, she had always seemed weak and easily manipulated, someone he had toyed with. But now, the woman who he thought was easily controlled had somehow acquired the power to buy out the entertainment company under Excellence Entertainment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Becoming a star had been his dream, but now, the termination was like a nightmare. The fear crept up inside him, leaving him trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie gazed at Levi. She had long since understood the situation. If he had been willing to admit the child she carried and marry her, perhaps everything would have been different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, she had felt that her love with George was too distant. She didn't know when he would return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if she had become the mistress of the Robinson family, everything would have changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could help George and also wield the power of the Robinson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, she knew deep down that Steven would never marry her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though her heart was as clear as a mirror and she understood everything, she still made decisions that went against her own best interests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was at this moment that she realized that she was a woman who could give up all love, and all that mattered to her now was her career.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smiled, her eyes curving into a soft, mocking expression as she delivered a harsh truth. "Levi, don't you still understand? Your family is already on its last legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Recently, your family has lost various projects. Now, you're the only one left to carry the weight. But how did you treat me back then? Are you sure it was me who seduced you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had originally planned to use his status as an award-winning actor to take down Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Levi, far from being foolish, turned out to be quite clever. He had realized she was using him and deliberately distanced himself from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes burned with fury. At that moment, he realized the truth. He hadn't entangled himself with a woman but with a devil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Queenie, after I rejected you, you started plotting against my family's company?" His words were filled with disbelief. He wouldn't rest until he understood everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't accept that he was being kicked out of the entertainment industry just like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After being terminated from his contract, he arranged meetings with several agents from other companies. Yet, no one dared to take him in. He realized his career in the industry was over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What shocked him the most was the fact that he had been brought down by a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie didn't hide her ambitions and smiled wildly, "That's right. During the time we filmed together, I got to understand your family and the situation of your company. It was you who blabbed everything to me. That's why you failed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never been with these second-generation rich men for romance. Her true goal was to gather business intelligence. This allowed her team to quickly find new opportunities for collaboration, and that was always her purpose. She wasn't foolish enough to become a love-struck fool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she would never be like Diana, who devoted herself entirely to Steven, wasting her youth and letting her life slip by in pursuit of a fleeting fantasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her company had grown the fastest during her time with Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, she had squandered that opportunity by playing her cards wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she had known everything that happened in the dream earlier, she would have severed ties with George long ago and married Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her original plan was to marry Steven and then quietly eliminate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she'd have had George take his place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sadly, Steven had already discovered her secret. He didn't hold it against her. Instead, he was moved by her love and gave her a second chance to redeem herself. Yet, she was unaware of that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Levi's eyes widened in shock, and his tall figure staggered back a few steps. He couldn't believe that the problem with their company was because of the woman standing before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha..." He laughed. It was a helpless laugh, but also a regretful laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie coldly stared at him, showing no sympathy for his situation, knowing that he was a scumbag himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And all scumbags should go to hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he shirk responsibility after using her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Levi, I will treat you the same way you treated me in the past." Queenie's cold voice caused Levi's words to abruptly halt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at her fiercely. "Queenie, you are a devil. You destroy people's wealth and ruin their lives. I will kill you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't let me live, then neither of us will live, then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was truly foolish, deceived by her innocent appearance and gentle voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Levi rushed over and reached out to strangle Queenie's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in his rage, he did not see the strong Mario. Before he could touch Queenie, Mario quickly stepped forward and kicked him in the abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..." Levi fell hard to the ground. He was kicked and his belly hurt. He curled up and glared at Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, you have schemed against so many people. You won't have a peaceful end. Even if it's not me, someone else will kill you!" he roared heartbreakingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie admired his painful expression, thinking that she was in the same pain at the beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what was his pain? She was the one who suffered the most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Levi, if you had agreed to my conditions at the beginning, how could you have ended up like this?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="993.html">« Prev</a><a href="995.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
