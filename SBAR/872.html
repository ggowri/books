Her eyes widened in anger as she glared at Paige's smug expression. Through gritted teeth, she said, "Paige, how dare you raise the price?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige tilted her head, feigning confusion. "Queenie, raising the price is a sign of respect. Or are you saying you're only worth a million dollars?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She threw Queenie's own words back at her. Queenie was arrogant, and Paige felt there was no need to hold back with someone like her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her original demand had been more than reasonable, but Queenie had called her cheap. So, she'd increase the price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige now understood that dealing with someone like Queenie required a billionaire's mindset, not ordinary reasoning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she treated Queenie like Queenie was a billionaire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's hands clenched tightly at her sides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When has Paige become so cunning?" she thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Paige she remembered had been meek, especially when it came to Frank. Back then, no matter how Queenie mocked her, she wouldn't dare talk back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Paige dared to play games with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paige, with that money-grubbing attitude of yours, it's no wonder Frank didn't like you," Queenie sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige snorted, cutting her off. "Liking Frank and making myself suffer was the dumbest thing I've ever done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But at least Frank was lucky. Diana and I genuinely cared about him. You? Every bit of love or admiration you've ever gotten was faked, stolen, or manipulated. No one truly cares about you, Queenie. You've hurt everyone who ever tried to."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't think dodging this mess means you've won. I'm not throwing you in jail yet because I'm waiting for you to mess up bigger. That's when you'll really face the music. What happened today would be nothing comparing to that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten million dollars. Not a penny less. Your life is so precious, isn't it? Surely, that's nothing for someone as noble as you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie felt like she was going to explode. She'd tried to pull a fast one, and now she was the one being extorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she had to pay for an extra nine million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her laugh was cold. "Paige, do you really think your life is worth as much as mine? You're nothing but trash."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie," Paige said, her voice icy, "you're the illegitimate child. I'm the real Sutton heiress. So, who's the trash here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think I was weak before because I feared you? No. It was because I liked Frank and didn't want trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So stop acting like you're superior. The person who doesn't deserve anything is you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your nerve is impressive, but let me be clear. Have the money in my account by tonight. If there's even a penny missing, tomorrow morning, the evidence of you orchestrating my kidnapping will be playing on every screen in the city. Let's see how people react to the real Queenie Marsh."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige raised her brow, her grin smug and triumphant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's expression darkened with fury. The more satisfied Paige looked, the angrier she became.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paige, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie," Paige cut her off with a mocking laugh, "what? I love seeing you angry but powerless. Look at you, so mad you can't even breathe, and yet, you can't do a thing about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paige, I swear I'll kill you!" Queenie shrieked, on the verge of losing control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had never been provoked like this before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I believe you," Paige replied cheerfully. "You almost managed it today. But look, here I am, still alive. Try again if you've got the guts. Watching you so furious and helpless is just delightful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie screamed, clutching her head in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had known about her miscarriage and still thrown her into the freezing ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor had warned her that the cold had damaged her uterus. With inflammation and complications, she'd struggle to conceive again without extensive treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news had hit her like a thunderbolt. She hated Levi with every fiber of her being for putting her in this situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige stared, startled by Queenie's hysterics.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, alright. Don't lose it here. Go find a quiet corner to scream in. You're making a scene and embarrassing yourself. Where's all your dignity?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige's voice dripped with mockery, crushing what was left of Queenie's pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking back to all the humiliation she had endured for Frank, Paige felt a pang of regret. She felt she had been so blind, so pathetic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time she thought about how she'd groveled for him, she wanted to slap herself awake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's bloodshot eyes filled with tears as she stormed away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige quickly messaged Diana: [Diana, Queenie went nuts. She stormed out in a rage.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana, who was in the middle of lunch, paused when she saw the message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie wasn't someone to take lightly. She was vindictive to her core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige had calculated against her and offended her; she would definitely return it a hundredfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Paige, be careful. She holds grudges. She could try to kill you over one insult. Don't underestimate her.] Diana warned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[I demanded 10 million dollars as compensation. She agreed.] Paige replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana frowned. If anything, this made her even more anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Will Queenie hand over the money without retaliation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impossible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if she paid, she'll find a way to take it back a hundredfold."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paige, stay alert. Watch your family's company too. She won't let this slide," Diana urged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remembered Paige was badly calculated by Queenie in the last life because of that scum Frank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige hesitated. Deep down, she knew Diana was right. Queenie was more venomous than a scorpion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Don't worry, Diana. I'll be fine. Just remember to bring me lunch when you come back.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Diana's reply, Paige set her phone aside and lay down to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Queenie returned to her hospital room, still seething with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario arrived soon after, his face clouded with concern. "Ms. Marsh, where were you? The doctor said you need rest and proper treatment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie lay back, staring at the ceiling. She wiped away her tears and said coldly, "Mario, find Paige's account. Transfer her 10 million dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? That woman demanded 10 million dollars? For what? She brought this on herself. Why should we pay her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario was furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smirked coldly. "It's fine. Let her have it. Let's see if she lives long enough to enjoy it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie didn't intend to let it go so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario understood immediately. They'd pay Paige now, but there would be consequences later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood, Ms. Marsh. I'll handle it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He handed her a meal. "For now, please eat and rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie slowly sat up and let Mario transfer money to Paige, quietly </span><span>eating</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she ate, her mind spun with schemes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Steven wouldn't help her anymore. From now on, she'd have to rely on herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes narrowed with determination. Levi had made her life a living hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wouldn't rest until she bled him dry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing her meal, she pulled out her phone and called Levi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well, Queenie," Levi's deep, lazy voice answered. "What's the occasion?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her body warmed as she pictured his athletic frame. "Levi, I've taken care of the baby. Now it's your turn to deliver. You promised to protect me. Was that just talk, or do you mean it?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="871.html">« Prev</a><a href="873.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
