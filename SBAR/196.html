Queenie knew exactly why she was here, but tonight, it was likely Queenie who'd be watching a show.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes, I'm here. Congrats on becoming someone's mistress. Should I beat the drums and let everyone see how you stole someone else's husband?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You..." Queenie released Steven's arm quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was then that she noticed Steven was staring at Diana with intense admiration in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana had arrived in stunning attire. A black gown with diamond straps that made her shine brilliantly. She looked beautiful tonight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Why was Diana so wealthy?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her outfit alone seemed worth millions of dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven noticed it, too. No wonder he forgot to give her money. She wasn't lacking any.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, you're bullying Queenie again," Jeff's angry voice echoed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana turned to see Jeff approaching with Paula.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula appeared thinner, her face pale. The effects of the drug must have kicked in, but Jeff looked even more haggard than Paula.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana furrowed her brow, observing Jeff's odd expression for a moment before realizing what was wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tsk! Jeff's face bore the signs of physical exhaustion. He'd overindulged, likely leaving him unable to engage in shameless behavior.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"How could I dare bully her? Your daughter knowingly became a mistress, and you're yelling so loudly. Aren't you afraid of embarrassing yourself?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jeff's face turned red. "You wretched girl, what nonsense are you spouting? Do you want to ruin Queenie?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"If I can ruin her, that's quite a skill on my part."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Pfft..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana looked at Luna, wondering why she was laughing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie was no simple opponent. She'd exhausted Diana to the core.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula's eyes were full of guilt as she looked at Diana. In the past, they always blamed Diana without hearing her side of the story.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They never listened to her, and she suffered countless grievances. It was all because of her mistakes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If she had realized Jeff's schemes sooner, her five children wouldn't have suffered so much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had loved Jeff too much, but now that she saw the truth, all she felt was hatred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Enough, let's stop this and head inside," Steven said indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana and Luna walked ahead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana no longer competed with Queenie out of jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Making money was more important. Why bother with a scumbag?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Once inside the banquet hall, they saw that many guests had already arrived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jace was dressed in a tailored suit, accompanied by his granddaughter, mingling with the guests.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing Queenie's family, Jace smiled kindly at her. "Queenie, your family is finally here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Walking beside Steven, Queenie cheerfully greeted, "Mr. Foliot, sorry to keep you waiting. These are my parents. This is Steven Gellar."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jeff and Paula stepped forward to greet him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Foliot, it's truly an honor to meet you!" Jeff said happily, thinking how impressive Queenie was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had even earned the respect of someone as significant as Jace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jace smiled warmly. "I've a special bond with Queenie. Don't hesitate to ask if the Marsh family ever needs anything from me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jeff grinned from ear to ear. "Thank you, Mr. Foliot, for your kindness toward Queenie."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula was surprised. How did Queenie get acquainted with the Foliot family?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lately, she'd been busy with company matters and hadn't noticed what Queenie had been up to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Somehow, Queenie had managed to earn Jace's admiration.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="195.html">« Prev</a><a href="197.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
