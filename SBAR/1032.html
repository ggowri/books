"Evan, are you a mind reader?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was still thinking about Diana's soft and gentle lips. No other woman could make him feel that way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan smiled at his longing eyes. It was a pity that Steven was almost thirty and still a virgin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled, "Mr. Gellar, I know you all too well. I can tell at a glance. You..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan hesitated. "Forget it. Mr. Gellar, Lillian should be sent by George. She should be the woman who wanted to hypnotize you before. It's just that Queenie has never found an opportunity to attack you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eyes were cold. "Queenie and George will definitely find a way to get her out, give her a new identity, and then continue to do evil things. We have to find a way to keep her from getting out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven squinted his eyes and thought for a while, then said, "Forget it, let her out. Queenie will definitely use her to do more disgusting things, and then we will put her in jail again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that the situation had changed, he could dig up something that Diana couldn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan suddenly grabbed the phone and said, "Mr. Gellar, check this out. Queenie Marsh, the famous young entrepreneur, just found some ancient artifacts on her company&rsquo;s project site."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Marsh gave up all her claims and handed the artifacts over to the government. As a young entrepreneur, she's shown real social responsibility and care for cultural preservation. This goes beyond just making money&mdash;it's about having true entrepreneurial spirit and cultural </span><span>responsibility."Evan</span><span> thought Queenie was really clever. Once this news got out, all her past actions would be overshadowed by her so-called selfless act. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People who love antiques or archaeology would definitely rally around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie would end up as the biggest winner, possibly even clearing her name. Her PR team would jump at the chance to spin this in her favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked out the window with a cold, calculating gaze. He had forgotten how good Queenie was at playing the victim and twisting the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan kept scrolling through the news. Soon enough, Queenie's company's PR team released a </span><span>statement.The</span><span> statement read: "Ms. Marsh, once an artist caught up in some bad press, was wrongly accused. She was upset by the rumors but kept doing what she believed was right." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even more impressive, she discovered a bunch of valuable artifacts with her new project and handed them over without hesitation. We promise that everything said against Ms. Marsh before was untrue."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once this statement was out, public opinion flipped. Doubts turned into praise. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie managed to clear her name, and maybe she'd shine as a star once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The statement caused quite a sensation on the social media.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan knew what Queenie was capable of and </span><span>gpt</span><span> a bit worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, I think Queenie's going to clear her name. Check out the news&mdash;people in the archaeology circle are backing her up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leonardo Lloyd, a big name in archaeology, posted: "[Ms. Marsh's generous act is truly inspiring. In wealthy families, conflicts of interest are just part of the deal. Everyone's looking to climb the ladder, and Ms. Marsh has been through a lot. We should appreciate her drive.]"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lori Ziegler from the antique industry commented: "[Ms. Marsh's fearless dedication deserves respect. Disputes are just a given in rich families. Everyone wants to succeed. Ms. Marsh's journey has been full of ups and downs. We need to appreciate her determination.]"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right after that, Queenie's company dropped another announcement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>QM Company: [Ms. Marsh actively participated in many charity activities while working in the company, which are all strong evidence of her good deeds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She has lived under the shadow of her father since she was a child. If she hadn't fought hard, she would have been the one who suffered misfortune. She had a tragic fate and was used as a bargaining chip by her biological parents to exchange interests. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she failed, she was ruthlessly abandoned and fell into a desperate situation of isolation and helplessness. Please stop the bullying. Ms. Marsh is a really good person!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were too shameless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could these people lie like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, these people really got brainwashed. Queenie is so vicious. She is a murderer. Are these people crazy to speak for her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was so angry that he wanted to kill someone. He still remembered the cold seawater. A person as crazy as Queenie was simply terrible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at his furious look and frowned slightly. "Don't be too angry. There will be plenty of opportunities for you to take revenge in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan didn't expect that they made Queenie lose half of her assets but brought her a good reputation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he saw Queenie's company selling goods on livestreaming. He was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Holy crap, Mr. Gellar. Queenie really made the most of this opportunity. Look at her livestream. It's number one on the sales list."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1031.html">« Prev</a><a href="1033.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
