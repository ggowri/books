Regardless of her purpose, he was very grateful to Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil took a deep breath to adjust his mood, got up and washed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He changed into red clothes, a red shirt, and red pants. Not only did they not look out of place on him, but they also made him look handsome, charming, and eye-catching.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to wear red today for good luck.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana and Rita were chatting when they saw Cecil.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes flashed with surprise. He was so attractive!</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his demeanor seemed to have changed again. He looked arrogant, and his eyes were cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Rita felt that Cecil had changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cecil." Rita looked at Cecil and seemed to be much calmer.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil walked over, smiled and sat next to Diana, his head resting on Diana's shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was slightly stunned, then asked with a smile, "Cecil, are you still scared?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil raised his head and looked at Diana, blinking. As if his earlier sense of maturity had been an illusion, he became like a teenager again.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, thank you! If it weren't for you, our family would have disappeared long ago."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil said it with a smile, a little choked up, and felt lucky.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was slightly stunned. Looking at his complicated expression, she asked, "Cecil, is there anything else in your dream?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why she was waiting here.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil didn't want to recall the past. He smiled and asked, "Did I have a terrible death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Rita heard this, she was frightened. "What are you two talking about? Don't say that."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil shook his head and said, "Grandma, you don't understand. Last night, I really felt the feeling of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandma, I won't make the same mistake again this time."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rita looked at him blankly, hoping that he could grow up quickly. The Farley family needed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil smiled and asked, "Diana, can you answer my question?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't know what to say, so she said, "You... Actually... It's just like what I said last time."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana pointed at his hands and feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil smiled bitterly. The murderous intent in his eyes could not be dissolved.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled, "Diana, I know why I had this dream."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil's eyes were full of tears. "I came back for revenge, and also to repay my gratitude. Diana, I'm sorry. I hurt you.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You help me regardless of the past. I will protect you in this life."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil's eyes were filled with sorrow, and tears were streaming down his face. He wanted to laugh, but more tears fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to speak several times but felt so painful.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought about the grievances she had suffered in her previous life and knew that he wanted to protect the people he loved.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She reached out and wiped away his tears. "Cecil, that's in the past."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil said, "In the end, you died too! Queenie said she would kill you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil laughed bitterly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana and Rita both looked at him worriedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Cecil said, "The reason why I am here is because before I died, I prayed for a new life. I was so miserable.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before I died, I realized that everything was planned by Queenie and another man. They plotted against the Farley family. And you, regardless of past grudges, reminded me to pay attention to Queenie. But I never listened to you, which led to my parents' tragic deaths and my grandmother's death from anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not to mention my fate."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Diana wanted to investigate most was the man behind Queenie. "Cecil, have you seen the man next to Queenie?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil said, "Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana asked excitedly, "What does he look like?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="672.html">« Prev</a><a href="674.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
