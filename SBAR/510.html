This time, the two had the same idea. "</span><span>We</span><span> had the same idea. But this time, Diana gave it to me on purpose. Go check it out. I have framed her countless times before. I am afraid she will plot against me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Diana is out of my control. I have to find out the truth first." Diana's counterattacks these times made Queenie very cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario smiled, "Ms. Marsh, you worry too much. We found out that Diana doesn't have any special abilities. The family that adopted her may be okay. But they can't compete with you. Ms. Marsh, you don't have to be afraid of her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The master also said that Steven has been preparing for buying the land in the western suburbs for half a year. He has always wanted to buy it, but the Farley family has not agreed. There has only been some movement recently. The master said that after the western suburbs are developed, the school and medical care will be integrated. It's future development is immeasurable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie still felt a little uncertain. "Mario, for safety's sake, you should go investigate and see how many people are fighting for it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was still worried, fearing that Diana would cheat. She thought, "Diana once said that she would drag us all to hell as long as she was alive. A person who is not afraid of death can do terrible things."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After Diana left, she became more resourceful. She even </span><span>actually</span><span> asked me to buy it. How could I be stupid enough to be tricked by her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario said, "Ms. Marsh, more than a dozen companies are eyeing this piece of land. It is very popular. Before I called you, I received a call from the master. The master's people have already checked it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cecil wants to sell it because their company has problems recently. He wants to sell some of his assets to fill the gap in funds."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie thought, "Since I snatched away the Woodston's project, the Farley family has lost a lot of money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if Cecil knows that I did it, he has no evidence and can't do anything to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He can only suffer in silence and has no place to complain. It's thrilled to see Cecil getting humiliated and angry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smiled proudly, "Now that you have found out everything, let's wait and buy the land. Diana is still thinking of the family affection of the Marsh family. She will help me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only if Queenie thought this way would she not feel that Diana had ulterior motives in helping her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario reminded her, "Ms. Marsh, no matter if Diana has other ideas or not, we must take this piece of land. The government has already started planning for it. It is beneficial to us. We have already received the news in advance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we can buy the two adjoining plots, we can make a lot of money later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie felt relieved when she heard that they had already investigated it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Now, I'm just waiting for good news from Diana."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana walked around for a while and then received a call from Cecil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She told him the address. And then, he came to find Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two went to a club. Cecil ordered some snacks for Diana that she liked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana saw the fried chicken. She put on disposable gloves and ate some. Then, she said, "Cecil, is the land in the western suburbs really under your name?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="509.html">« Prev</a><a href="511.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
