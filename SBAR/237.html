I will definitely be happy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana knew that Olivia would not lie to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Olivia, I'm in a good mood today and don't have to go to the company. Go take a shower, change your clothes, and we'll go out for something delicious."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana could spend some time with Olivia today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Olivia was very happy. "Okay! Wait for me. I'll be there soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana sat in the garden waiting for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked down at her phone and saw that Alexander had sent her a message.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Diana, I'm back home. Do you have time tonight? I'll treat you to dinner.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana said: [Alexander, is tomorrow night okay? I'm taking a day off today and want to spend time with my friend.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander said: [Okay, it's settled then. Tomorrow night.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana agreed and planned to talk to him about work tomorrow night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had already prepared the design drawings. She raised her eyes and looked at the bright sky. She must live a good life in this life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shielded her eyes from the dazzling sunlight with her hands. The irritability in her heart seemed to disappear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought about where the boy would appear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man was nineteen years old and needed money to go to college. Where could he be?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was watching the video and suddenly saw the news about the Foliot family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was slightly startled. According to her memories of her previous life, the Foliot group had a movie that had been in preparation for two years and was about to start shooting. In her previous life, the heroine was made famous by the Foliot family's spending of money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In this life, Queenie was actually the heroine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was shocked. Queenie's fate was also changing. She was luckier than in her previous life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana stood up and paced back and forth in annoyance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought, "How did Queenie convince Jace to let her, a newcomer, play the leading female role?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana called Luna.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna answered the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Luna, check why the Foliot family gave Queenie the leading female role? This is a big production, but they dared to use a newcomer. There must be something behind this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna hesitated for a moment before saying, "Diana, there is investment from Steven. Because Queenie is the lead actress, Steven invested one hundred million dollars. Queenie brought money into the group. And the female lead was snatched away by her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was shocked. Such a big thing happened in just one day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana felt pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the previous life, Steven was like this, always helping Queenie fulfill her dreams and become successful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Diana felt that Steven was a little different from before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's temper changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana sighed. As expected, he still loved Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, let's go. I'm ready." Olivia was dressed casually, with her hair tied in a ponytail, a white T-shirt, and blue jeans. She looked so full of life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled and walked towards her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana went to the garage to drive the car. The two went to eat delicious food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as they sat down, they heard a mocking voice. "Hey! Diana?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="236.html">« Prev</a><a href="238.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
