Was it Queenie?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She suddenly thought of Cecil and turned to Alexander, saying, "Alexander, let's go check it out."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was a crowd gathered outside the lounge on the second floor.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Diana and Alexander arrived, they saw Queenie barely clothed, with Cecil on top of her, kissing her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven and Jace were each trying to pull Cecil up.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil was dazed and disoriented, his eyes unfocused.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven clenched his fist and punched Cecil in the face.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana rushed in and saw Cecil's veins bulging. With his current state of poisoning, he couldn't withstand Steven's punch; his veins would burst, and he'd die for sure.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana ran over as fast as she could and caught Cecil in her arms.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, a sharp pain hit the back of her head.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah..." Diana cried out in pain.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven couldn't believe it. Seeing Diana rush out like that, was she really risking her life for Cecil?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No, if Diana was here, then...</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven looked at Queenie and realized she and Diana were wearing almost identical dresses.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They weren't exactly the same, but the hairstyle and dress style were similar.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had mistaken Diana for Queenie when Cecil assaulted her, which was why he attacked Cecil.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, you rushed in like this! You're crazy!" Steven shouted.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana ignored the pain and paid no attention to Steven, focusing only on Cecil, who was tugging at her clothes.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She slapped Cecil's face forcefully. "Cecil, snap out of it."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil's grip was strong, and Diana's clothes were almost torn apart.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil's body was burning hot, and he was completely out of it.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd around them was merely watching, with no one willing to help. Alexander approached and asked, "Diana, what should we do?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's eyes filled with tears as she watched Cecil, realizing he had been drugged. "Alexander, he's been poisoned. We need to get him to a hospital immediately. The poisoning is severe; he could die any moment."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was furious. She had warned him to be careful and not get set up.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her medicine was in the car, but Queenie wouldn't let them leave easily. She had only brought a clutch when she came in, leaving the medicine behind.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander said, "I have an antidote for this kind of situation."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander pulled a small pill from his bag and fed it to Cecil.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Rita arrived.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon seeing Queenie in the room, Rita understood everything. She pointed at Queenie and yelled, "You shameless woman! Last time, you tried to kill me by tampering with the pool. I let you go once, but you repay kindness with evil. Now you drugged my grandson to seduce him! Can't you live without a man?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's sobbing came to an abrupt stop. She was about to claim that Cecil had tried to assault her, but how dare this woman?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jace's eyes narrowed as he sharply addressed Rita. "Madam Farley, when we opened the door, it was your precious grandson on top of Queenie."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jace squinted, his eyes full of dishonest intent. He wanted the Farley business, and his interests aligned with Queenie's.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rita, being experienced, saw right through Jace's cunning intentions.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jace, everyone here saw you holding Queenie. Are you having an affair with her too?" she retorted.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="331.html">« Prev</a><a href="333.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
