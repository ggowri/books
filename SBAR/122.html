"Diana, you can't be so heartless. Harry's mother is disabled. If he goes to jail, what will happen to her mother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was so angry at his shameless words that she laughed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Gale, isn't this your fault? Why are you asking me what to do?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I am heartless? Why didn't you say you were heartless when you asked them to rape me? His mother is disabled. He knew there would be no one to take care of his mother, but he still made mistakes and sent himself to jail. So why did he do something illegal?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You are so kind and like to help others. You should bear the consequences of what you have done. Why should I be responsible as a victim?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Facing this shameless family, Diana had learned not to get angry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her tone was calm but without any warmth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, aren't you okay now? Go and sign a letter of understanding and rescue them, then I'll let you return to the Marsh Villa."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tobias instantly raised his fist and punched Gale in the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Ah..." Gale was knocked to the ground by Tobias.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tobias looked down at him and roared, "You son of a bitch. As long as I'm alive, there's no way I'll let Diana go back to your shameless family. Get lost!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale spat out a mouthful of turbid blood and stood up quickly. He was the one who caused today's incident. He had always been a righteous man and would not watch his friends get into trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, I know you want to return to the Marsh family. As long as you help me with this, I will talk to dad and let you go back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana looked at him with a smile and said, "Only you guys want a father like Jeff. I don't want to call that kind of person dad. He is a bastard. I just feel disgusted when I think of I am blood-related to him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When she thought of having such a father, her heart seemed to be suffocated by an invisible force and the unspeakable discomfort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The sadness in her heart surged like a raging tide. Diana leaned in Tobias' arms and sounded tired, "Tobias, let's go home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tobias looked at her sadly and felt as if his heart was torn apart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Okay! I will take you home." Tobias looked at Gale who was about to speak and gave him a cold warning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale clenched his fists. What did Diana mean?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale could only watch them leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Looking up, he saw Steven not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He ran over quickly and said, "Steven..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Before he could even finish his words, he was punched by Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale was furious, grimacing in pain. He felt very aggrieved at this moment and said, "Steven, we have been friends for so many years, why did you hit me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's eyes were cold and sharp, and his voice was furious, "Gale, are you still human? You let Harry humiliate your sister Diana. How could you do such a thing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale sneered. He touched his slapped face and said, "Steven, do you forget that you once insulted and humiliated her with us, just because she was vicious?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"We are the same kind. Does she deserve to be treated nicely by me as she is so vicious?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven didn't say anything. Gale's family believed that Diana had bad intentions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But apart from Queenie who said Diana was hurting her, has Diana ever hurt anyone else?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale was stunned. "Half a year ago, she and Althea plotted against me and made me sleep with Althea. Do you think she has ever hurt me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale turned around and left angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven frowned and looked cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The words of Diana and Cecil had been sounding in his mind. Whether they were true, time would give him the answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie should get the video to prove that Diana had poisoned his mother and bribed the servants in his villa, or that she had never left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even if she had left, she might have come back without them knowing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie had good computer skills.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven looked at Evan behind him and said, "Go check what happened half a year ago. Half a year ago, you were there."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan remembered that night when Queenie's family hung out and insisted on asking them to go along.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Althea, who lived next door to the Marsh family, also went.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That night, something happened.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="121.html">« Prev</a><a href="123.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
