The Foliot family has provided us with what they claim is substantial evidence, and, well, they've gone public with it. Things are getting a little heated online. You should probably be careful. We can send someone to pick you up. Could you give me your current address? We weren't able to reach anyone at the one you previously provided."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer's calm tone suggested he was confident Diana wouldn't try to run.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana replied calmly, "There's no need to tie up police resources. I'll drive myself over. I'll be there in ten minutes. Don't worry. I'm not running. I want to clear this up, properly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sounds good. We appreciate that. We're all waiting for you here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana hung up and glanced at the news alerts on her phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[New Evidence: Diana's Clothing Found at First Murder Scene!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Diana is a Murderer!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Diana Destroyed the Body!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sighed inwardly. Public opinion, fueled by the Foliot family and Queenie, had turned against her. Her name was trending for all the wrong reasons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel was also seizing this opportunity to attack her. It was certainly absurd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She texted Luna, asking her to come and drive her to the station.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost immediately, her phone rang. It was Cecil. "Hello?" Diana answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana! Are the Foliot family ever going to give it a rest? You were with me, at my house, the day Mrs. Foliot died! Steven was there, too! These people are insane! Spreading lies like this. I just want to tear them apart!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled. "It's okay. I've got this. Don't worry about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil complained, "It's just ridiculous! It's freezing out, snowing even, and they can't even let that stop them from stirring up drama."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana chuckled. "I know. Cecil, I'm headi</span>ng to the police station now. I'll call you later."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, let me come with you. I'll testify. You were at my place that night. Steven didn't want to get involved, but my grandmother and I will back you up. We even have security footage. They can't arrest you."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana knew the Foliot family couldn't actually harm her. "Cecil, trust me. I can handle this. I gotta go now."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Downstairs, she found Steven hadn't left for work yet.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, the Foliot family is at it again. I..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana interrupted with a smile, "Steven, I told you before, I don't need your help. I can deal with this myself."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No. I've got this. I don't want you to get involve<span>d. I'm going now. You should head to work."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven started to follow, but she stopped and looked back at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised an eyebrow, bracing himself for another rejection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, she smiled. "Mr. Gellar, since you know someone's pulling Queenie's strings, you should keep your distance from me. If Queenie thinks that you're still interested in her and that you can be of use to her, whoever's behind this will eventually slip up. We need to draw them out. Don't you agree?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at her with a flicker of something unreadable in his eyes. He reached out, gently stroking her delicate face. His touch was possessive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wicked smile played on his lips. His voice was low and seductive, "Diana, do you really think I need to play games with Queenie to expose whoever is behind this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't confronted Queenie because he still had questions he needed answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman he'd once cared for had turned out to be a liar. Did Queenie really think he would let her off that easily?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="814.html">« Prev</a><a href="816.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
