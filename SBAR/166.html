But with Queenie's recent suicide attempt, the Marsh family is bound to pin all the blame on me&mdash;especially Queenie. She'll be looking for a chance to strike.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"With Jace's birthday party just around the corner, if she plans to make a move, it'll likely be that night. Her favorite game is to humiliate me in public while she plays the victim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"So, I need you to keep a close eye on her. I don't trust anyone else to handle this; I'll deal with that issue with the ten gigolos myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna nodded, understanding the gravity of the situation. "Got it, Ms. Bishop. I'll keep her in my sights."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After hanging up, Diana looked down at her relationship map, feeling the weight of the challenges ahead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But fear didn't grip her; she had been given a second chance at life, and this time, Diana was determined to reclaim every connection Queenie had so deceitfully acquired in her past life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With everything organized in her mind, Diana felt a sense of relief wash over her. She headed to bed, sinking into the plush comfort of her mattress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Reaching for her phone, she sent a quick message in the group chat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">[Tobias, Grandpa, goodnight!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tobias replied almost instantly: [Goodnight, Diana!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing his response, she closed her eyes, letting sleep take her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana always left a bedside lamp on, casting a warm glow that highlighted her serene features.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">While Diana drifted peacefully into slumber, Queenie was anything but at ease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Since Diana had awakened on her birthday, everything had unraveled. Queenie's meticulously crafted plans were falling apart, and the anger simmering inside her was palpable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After returning from the hospital, Queenie had locked herself in her room, frantically trying to arrange her next steps and track down the people she needed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She mused, "The birthday party for Jace is just around the corner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">I've already set my people to work on Cecil's side. I can't afford to lose the Foliot family's support now that I've lost the Farley family's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This time, I have to make it work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If Cecil can't be my pawn, then I'll have to eliminate him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He cannot become my rival."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She dialed her trusted subordinate, Felicity Aniston.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Hello! Ms. Marsh," Felicity answered, her voice steady.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Felicity, keep a close watch on Jace's whereabouts. I need to see him before the party, no matter where he is."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie stared out into the dark night sky, her expression icy and resolute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The fragile demeanor she usually projected was gone, replaced by a fierce intensity that made her unrecognizable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Understood, Ms. Marsh. I'll track down Jace's movements as quickly as I can."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Good! Also, I've set things in motion on Cecil's end. Just give it a little push from your side."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After the call, a wicked smile crept onto Queenie's face. "Diana, there's no way you'll ever outmaneuver me. So what if you're a designer? You're just a small-time designer, and I'll crush you completely."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She tossed her phone aside, her gaze falling to her injured wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Memories of Steven's coldness flooded back, and she wondered, "What went wrong?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven doesn't trust me anymore?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Or is it because of those photos I sent to Diana?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">I thought I retracted most of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Could Diana have taken screenshots?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Frustrated, Queenie stood up, pacing the room. She needed Steven's support, his trust, and the secrets of his company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her lips pressed together, her eyes darkened with determination. She couldn't understand where she had faltered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The fact that Steven acknowledged Diana as his wife was unacceptable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I can't let this happen! I have to make Diana the target of everyone's scorn!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just then, her phone buzzed with a new message, interrupting the tempest of her thoughts.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="165.html">« Prev</a><a href="167.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
