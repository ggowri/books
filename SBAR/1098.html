Her relaxed movements were effortlessly alluring. Steven watched her, fighting the urge to pull her into his arms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was alluring, undeniably sexy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his smooth, captivating voice, Steven said, "Diana, I</span><span>'</span><span>ve made breakfast. Freshen up and come down to eat."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana listened to his voice, her heart fluttering.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A usually aloof man had a unique charm when he showed tenderness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was exactly that kind of man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t surprised that Steven made breakfast. This was his first move to win her over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He would do everything she liked, just like she had when she pursued him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t willing to give up, so she might as well enjoy the feeling of being spoiled by a man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back then, she loved Steven with all her heart. This time, she wanted to feel his affection instead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright! I</span><span>'</span><span>ll be right down." Diana felt much lighter, a playful smile spreading across her face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven froze for a moment, feeling as if he</span><span>'</span><span>d been transported back to their days in the villa.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He snapped out of it, and when he looked at Diana again, she had already stepped into the bathroom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled and headed downstairs to make breakfast.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana came down quickly, now dressed in a white tracksuit. The mornings and evenings had been chilly lately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She went straight to the kitchen after coming downstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven came out carrying two plates of breakfast&mdash;sandwiches, milk, and a fried egg. It was quite a spread.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Diana, try the breakfast I made. It</span><span>'</span><span>s not as good as yours, but I put a lot of effort into it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The breakfast was filled with his love.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the internet being so advanced now, he followed an online video to make the sandwiches, and they turned out perfect on his first try.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana took a bite of the fried egg, looked at him in surprise, and said, "This is really good."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's nerves finally eased.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His palms were sweaty. He suddenly realized that in front of the woman he loved, he could feel both extremely nervous and incredibly excited at the same time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was so wonderful. He just wanted to spoil her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven sat down and tried the breakfast he made. It actually tasted pretty good.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He smiled and looked across at Diana. She was eating a sandwich.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sandwich he made today was smaller, making it easier for her to eat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana met his eyes and asked, "The veggies are so fresh. Did you go out to buy them this morning?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven replied, "Yeah! There's a market here every morning. I know you love seafood, so I got a lot of fish and some crabs. I remember when I couldn't see, you wouldn't let me eat crabs, said it wasn't good for recovery. But you really love them yourself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, make me some crab for lunch today, will you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven just wanted a simple life with her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He enjoyed the simplicity of life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana paused slightly, looked at Steven, and asked, "Are you serious?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her, puzzled, and asked, "Of course."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After answering, he realized she was asking if he was serious about pursuing her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said gently, "I</span><span>'</span><span>m serious!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His tone was firm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt a twinge of sadness. Years of longing had finally come true, yet she wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t happy&mdash;she was sad instead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana gave a bitter smile and said, "Steven, if I had heard this a year ago, I would</span><span>'</span><span>ve been so happy. But now, all I feel is sadness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sadness in her eyes betrayed her feelings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "Why did you wait until I</span><span>'</span><span>ve been through all the pain to say this to me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meeting her gaze, Steven blurted out, "I</span><span>'</span><span>m sorry!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled and said, "It</span><span>'</span><span>s okay. I</span><span>'</span><span>ve already forgiven you. The rest, God will take care of."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was truly heartbroken at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This feeling was too complicated, something she had never experienced before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt happy, yet sad at the same time, her emotions a tangled mess.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But seeing Steven upset made her feel sad too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "After living two lives, can I still not escape his cage?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana decided to follow her heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this relationship, Steven had never been hurt. Instead, he kept hurting her. Everything now was what he owed her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She would shamelessly enjoy it all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt helpless about how she had to soothe her own emotions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven felt a pang of sadness seeing her hurt expression. He thought, "Why did God make her endure so much pain before the truth finally came out?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now that he understood his feelings, he would act the way he should.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, I've only ever loved you. Your future is with me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His tone was domineering and forceful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stayed silent, lowering her head to eat the fried egg. It tasted amazing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven watched her focus on her food and decided not to disturb her further.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After breakfast, Steven went to wash the dishes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glanced out at the gloomy sky. The weather on the island changed quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wondered if it would rain. She wanted to go for a walk.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven walked out of the kitchen and saw Diana standing by the window.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From where she stood, she could see the ocean. The water was calm, deep blue, and the view was stunning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven walked over and wrapped his arms around her from behind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt his embrace and squirmed slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn</span><span>'</span><span>t want to talk to him right now. Her heart felt heavy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t help but think about the past&mdash;Steven</span><span>'</span><span>s cold stare, his restrained expression, and the moment he mercilessly tossed the divorce papers at her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of those moments still made Diana</span><span>'</span><span>s heart ache.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She let out a bitter laugh and said, "Steven, don</span><span>'</span><span>t do this."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven held her tightly, pressing a soft kiss to her cheek before whispering, "Diana, I</span><span>'</span><span>ve seen couples deeply in love, holding each other just like this. Back then, I</span><span>'</span><span>d only watch from afar, feeling envious. I used to wonder what it would feel like to hold the woman I love this way."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was a bit surprised&mdash;so he had longed for love too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She smiled and asked, "So, how does it feel now?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1097.html">« Prev</a><a href="1099.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
