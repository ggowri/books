She forbade you to eat ice cream because that is not good for your health.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And she didn't want you to wear out your life by staying up all night in bars. Your mom forced you to study to make you a better person, who was more capable of loving someone else than you now. You're still young..." she added.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up, old wretch. I didn't allow you to intervene in my business," Jean interrupted Rita angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her hands and left angrily. Soon, she disappeared in the wind and snow, hoping that her mom would never come back so that she could live with Amelie and her father forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at Jean's back and shook her head. "Rita, don't be angry. Just let her live the life she chose."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jean's outrageous moves didn't irritate Rita. She smiled and patted Diana's hand, replying, "Diana, I am indeed an old woman as she said, and I don't care about her insults. I just think that this child is too young to live a ruined life. What a pity."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled calmly, "Rita, you don't have to feel guilty about her wrong choices. She chose her own path. Accepting your opinion is out of her league. She is like a moth flying into a flame."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rita looked at her grandson, who was now gradually becoming mature and steady. She showed a relieved smile. "Diana, Cecil was just like Ms. Foliot before, but now, he has grown up in the past few months. It's all thanks to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't dare to take credit for it. She smiled at Cecil's handsome face and said in a low voice, "Rita, it's all thanks to himself."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil suddenly looked at her affectionately.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made her slightly stunned as she didn't understand the deep affection in his eyes, so she simply avoided his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil seemed a little depressed when she shunned her eyes. "Diana, thank you. If I hadn't met you, I'm afraid I would have been a loser by now."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled and said, "Come on, we should go. It will be very snowy and cold today."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, let's go home," said Cecil. After a momentary thought, Rita asked, "Diana, Christmas is coming in about one and a half months. Where are you going to spend the holiday this year?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought for a moment and said, "My brother and his family are all abroad and may not come back for Christmas. My grandfather is still on a long trip. Maybe I will decide when the time comes."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was still a month and a half left, so she didn't have to worry about having no one with her for Christmas. Besides, Luna and Nolan could celebrate Christmas with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay! If your grandfather doesn't come home by then, you can come to my house for Christmas." Rita invited her sincerely.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled and nodded. "Okay! Rita, I'll let you know. Let's get in the car now. It's very cold outside."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rita then got into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After turning her head, she saw Cecil grinning. He said, "Grandma, please come back first. I will take Diana back."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rita smiled lovingly. She really liked Diana, who was kind and tenacious, just like when she was young. "Okay, go ahead. I'm also worried if Diana goes back alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Rita's car left, Steven also arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Along with him came Alexander and Joseph.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, are you okay?" Alexander approached Steven and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled and shook her head to reassure him, "Alexander, I'm fine. Everything has been resolved."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt relieved and looked at Cecil with dissatisfaction.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="693.html">« Prev</a><a href="695.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
