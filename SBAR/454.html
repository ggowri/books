You're crazy! I'm going to sue you!" His voice trembled, more from shock than anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana calmly walked over, standing above him, her eyes sharp and focused. In the sunlight, she looked untouchable, almost effortlessly composed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think I'm only good for being your family's lackey, huh? Just a stepping stone for Queenie? Imagine if those words got out online. How long do you think her career would last?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And it'll be you who ruins her. Funny, isn't it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, and by the way, I'm not part of your family anymore. I owe you nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Squatting down next to him, Diana smirked, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "Look at you now, Eric. Who's really the stepping stone here? You're the one being used like a pawn for Queenie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think about it. How did your two older brothers end up where they are? It all leads back to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And guess what? You're next. Let's see how she deals with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she stood up, her smile casual but menacing. Eric's face drained of color, panic flickering in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander, who had been watching quietly, finally stepped forward. His voice was soft but full of concern. "Diana, these people are relentless. How did you even get through the last two years dealing with them?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="453.html">« Prev</a><a href="455.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
