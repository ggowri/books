She thought that after waiting for so many years, she could get everything from Paula, but in the end, she would have nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She roared angrily, "Jeff, you didn't get any of Paula's property? I waited for so long just to get everything from her. I didn't expect to be burdened with debt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was unhappy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She waited more than twenty years for nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had enjoyed Paula's kindness over the years and was coddled. She could not live a hard life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Jeff was very annoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Amelie and was not feeling well. Paula was worried, when he was not feeling well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Amelie only cared about money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff said, "Amelie, I'm in a bad mood today. Why did you bring that up? Do you want to pay those debts? Can you pay two billion dollars? I have a small company now, and with the company owned by my son, we will get better and better. Why are you worried?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if Paula's parents left her some of their property, I can't get it. They have already made a will, leaving everything to Paula. I can't get any of them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff had pains in his chest and difficulty breathing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Ah... I feel uncomfortable. Amelie, please bring me a pill quickly. I have difficulty breathing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie glared at him angrily. "Good-for-nothing, now even your body is not in good condition. It made me angry. I have waited for you for so many years. It's in vain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Amelie was angry, she gave him a pill and poured him a glass of water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie said that Jeff and her brothers still useful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana, who was on the island, knew all these things very well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna had made all the arrangements secretly. Although Diana was not in Capitole, she knew everything that was going on there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana and Althea had lunch, and Diana showed Althea the video and the news on the Internet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After reading it, Althea felt happy and refreshed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Diana, your father is a scumbag. He has a mistress and wants to take away everything from your mother..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled and stopped her, saying, "Althea, I have severed ties with their family. From now on, they are no longer my parents. Their sons have nothing to do with me. I will never forgive them. What happened to them has nothing to do with me. Jeff and Queenie have been secretly plotting against me. Queenie will get worse and worse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had only Steven to support her in this lifetime, but she would not let Queenie have the chance to hurt her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea patted Diana's hands. She had witnessed Diana's suffering with her own eyes, so she supported Diana in breaking off relations with the Marsh family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea said, "Diana, there is no need to maintain family ties or force them. We will always be friends and accompany each other. You will not be lonely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were adults and could move on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of the people in the Marsh family were good people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said, "Yes! But Penelope wanted to steal your child and threaten you. Now she has been arrested. I am worried that Gale will know about your affairs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea smiled, "Don't worry. Even if he finds out, I have a way. He can't take the child away. Do you want to know about my way?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="576.html">« Prev</a><a href="578.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
