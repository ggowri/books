It turned out that he couldn't have been more wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep breath. The more the truth revealed itself, the more it irked him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Diana despised him so deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Diana who had given everything, yet he'd favored the wrong person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven felt an inexplicable irritation. He loosened his tie, unbuttoning the top of his shirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still felt suffocated. Diana's beautiful yet resentful eyes appeared in his mind, fueling his irritation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan observed his agitation and thought, "Was he regretting his actions, feeling he'd done wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's phone on the desk rang. He picked it up, seeing it was Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello!" he answered in a hoarse and low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie picked up on the edge in his voice; he was definitely upset.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spoke gently, "Steven, you promised to have lunch with me. I'm downstairs at the company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven replied, "Alright, I'll be down shortly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hung up, grabbed his phone, and headed downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan shook his head. The moment Queenie called, Steven rushed to her. Unattainable love proved to have a terrifyingly magnetic pull.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan vowed to treat the woman he loved well in the future, never letting her get hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna's cold face suddenly popped into his mind. He shuddered, trying to shake off the image of Luna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought of Luna as fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Steven went downstairs, he saw Queenie dressed beautifully in a pink dress and matching windbreaker. Her straight hair danced wildly in the biting wind, radiating an aura of purity, beauty, and gentle grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last encounter had Steven barring Queenie from the office, and she knew exactly when to push forward and when to step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, you're here. I've booked a table at the restaurant ahead. Shall we go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven glanced at her calmly and nodded. "Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the high-end restaurant, they sat across from each other, eating. Steven's arrogant aura was captivating. Not far away, reporters snapped photos of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smiled, asking, "Steven, have you been busy lately?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven nodded calmly. "Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder you haven't had time to call me. Our relationship has grown distant. Don't you like me anymore?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at her with deep, unfathomable eyes. Upon a closer look, her face had its charm, yet it paled in comparison to the radiant beauty that Diana effortlessly possessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven smiled lightly but replied coldly, "Queenie, hasn't my kindness towards you lasted over ten years?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smiled gently, shaking her head. "It's not enough, Steven. It should last a lifetime. We must be together forever. You promised to marry me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That was because you saved me, and more importantly, because you've been by my side since childhood. I'm grateful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie thought, "Then what?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why not marry me if he was grateful?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What did he mean?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why didn't he finish what he was saying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven gazed down at his steak, taking a thoughtful bite before he spoke, "You know why I said yes to marrying you back then. But now, I can't, and you know the reason as well as I do. Queenie, it seems fate has decided we're not meant to be."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were like deep pools. Queenie found herself lost, unable to fathom the thoughts swirling within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once, she could see through Steven in an instant, but now, he was suddenly unreadable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His final words, declaring their lack of destiny together, struck her like a blow. Tears brimmed in her eyes as she realized that he truly didn't want her anymore. With a voice quivering, she shook her head, pleading, "Steven, you can't just let me down."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="504.html">« Prev</a><a href="506.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
