"What? Livestream?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The assistant pointed at Diana and said, "Ms. Bishop, you are too scheming. You are actually livestreaming here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled. She thought, "It feels so good to bully someone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She said, "Mr. Marsh slandered me. Can't I seek justice for myself?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Frank, it's time for you to experience the feelings of being accused. I've said before that I won't let you bully me again. Just wait for my counterattack."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana left after saying this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she went out, she met Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie raised her hand and wanted to slap Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unexpectedly, Diana slapped her first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah!" Queenie screamed. "Diana, you slapped me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So what? Can't I slap you? Queenie, this is just the beginning. I will let you pay the price for everything you have done to me." Diana's smile was weird but charming, making Queenie feel a chill down her back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie." Seeing Queenie being slapped, Frank stared at Diana's back with a malicious look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie, are you okay?" Frank looked at Queenie nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was angry. "Frank, don't you know that Diana is cunning? You ruined my career. I finally managed to be the female lead, but I lost it because of you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie slumped to the floor in desperation. She thought, "I tried desperately to get rid of the identity of an illegitimate daughter and became the real young lady of the Marsh family. But Frank, that idiot, dragged me down!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only then did Frank realize that Diana had plotted against him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana! Damn it!" Frank's eyes turned bloodshot with anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie, get up. Does your face hurt? I'll take you to the hospital, okay?" He bent down to help Queenie up, but Queenie shook his hand away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie looked at him with tears in her eyes. It turned out that Frank's doting could destroy her one day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She yelled, "Frank, are you stupid? Why did you treat Diana like that for me? Now, everyone knows that Diana was adopted by your family because of me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My reputation, the company's shares, and your company will all suffer huge losses because of what you just said."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie stood up and glared at Frank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank felt an inexplicable pain in his heart. He thought, "Why did Queenie blame me? I did these things all for her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Back then, Steven became disabled. Queenie was unwilling to marry him. To protect Queenie, the Marsh family forced Diana to marry Steven. After Steven recovered, they forced Diana to divorce him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Others didn't know the truth back then, but Frank knew it very well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, he saw the hatred in Queenie's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn!" Frank kicked the wall hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In his memory, Diana would never fight back, even if she was bullied. But he bullied Diana at will because he knew that she wanted family affection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana wanted it, but Frank didn't give it to her. He thought as long as she didn't go against Queenie, he would let her go. Unexpectedly, Diana actually dared to fight back and trick him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was furious, thinking, "Will my precarious company go bankrupt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The assistant, "Mr. Marsh, the Marsh Group's stock is falling. Your mother has issued a letter of severance to you. Your company has been founded not long ago. It will..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The company would go bankrupt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the assistant finished speaking, he lowered his head and dared not speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was stunned, asking in a trembling voice, "What did you just say? What did my mother do?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="294.html">« Prev</a><a href="296.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
