He never discussed his plans with her, yet now he was asking which villa she liked. It genuinely shocked her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She laughed. "Whether I like it or not doesn't matter. What's important is if you like it. It's not like I'm going to live there. I'll only stay here. But if you keep bothering me here, I'll move out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned again, his eyes blazing with anger. "We're married. I've already told you that. If you want Tobias to go bankrupt, go ahead and move."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's face went pale. "Steven, are you threatening me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven took his time, calmly eating a piece of fish. It was a deep-sea fish Diana had caught herself, incredibly fresh. It was only then that he turned to her. "You know how I am. When my interests are threatened, I don't mind making threats." She had her weaknesses, and he was ready to use them anytime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana laughed angrily. "You're so shameless. Don't you remember the things you've done to me? Steven, I hate you enough already, and I've made my stance clear. I'll never be with you. You don't want a divorce? Fine. If you're willing to keep Queenie as the other woman, I won't say a word. All I want is for both of you to disappear&mdash;get out of my life, get out of my sight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana threw down her fork and left the kitchen. She thought angrily, "How dare he use Tobias to threaten me? Steven is a total bastard." She grabbed her phone and bag from the sofa and headed out the door. She was going to the police station.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven watched her storm off, his dark eyes blazing with rage. "Diana, I'm not letting you go. You were the one who fell in love with me first, and you were the one who chased after me. As long as I haven't said it's over, it won't be." His gaze darkened, intense, and possessive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Diana was about to drive to the station, she received a call from the police asking her to come in to handle a traffic incident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was just pulling out of the gates when she spotted Evan standing outside. Still fuming, she ignored him and drove away without a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was left speechless, thinking, "Steven's driven Diana off again. Serves him right for having no wife."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven came out right after. Evan quickly stepped up to him with a smile and asked, "Mr. Gellar, are we heading to the office now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Has Diana gone out?" Steven asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan nodded. "She just left."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven opened the car door and got in, looking at Evan as he said, "Take me to the police station." Steven was aware that Diana would handle things with Samuel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, ever since overhearing Paula and Linda's conversation, Eric had spent the entire night processing everything, and then he began tailing Jeff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this time, Paula hadn't been coming home, and Jeff hadn't returned last night either. Instead, he'd gone to a villa and hadn't come out all night. Eric waited until dawn, finally spotting Jeff leaving with a woman. Jeff was holding her hand, and the two of them were clearly very close. They headed to a nearby market to buy groceries, and Eric, after putting on a disguise, went after them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were hardly any people around the villa area, so Amelie bravely asked, "Honey, when are you finally getting a divorce? How come Paula didn't lose her mind, yet here you are, all jittery?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lately, Jeff had been on edge, mainly because of his issues with, well, his manhood not working.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="487.html">« Prev</a><a href="489.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
