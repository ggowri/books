I brought you something delicious."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two met at a club near the wedding venue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the wedding was coming, they would go there quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige was well-dressed today. She wore a pink suit that was warm and elegant, making her look cute and beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was dressed up. She wore a pink dress with a circle of diamonds on her chest, which made her skin look bright and tender. Her jewelry was simple. Queenie was jealous. She would become aggressive if someone stole her thunder. So Diana tried to be low-key.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at Diana's beautiful face and flawless skin, Paige felt envious and wanted to pinch Diana's cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana sat next to Paige, looked at her, and said, "Paige, you have lost weight again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige smiled, "Ever since I worked in the company, I've been very busy. I have to walk tens of thousands of steps every day. I'm in charge of taking care of those models, so I eat less and walk more every day. Then, I lost some weight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana said, "Yeah, your round face has become a little thinner than before."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige held her face and smiled happily. She was satisfied with her face. Although it was not stunningly beautiful, she was delighted enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The day of becoming the person she liked was not far behind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige said, "These are the seafood I brought back from the island. Let's have lunch first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled, picked up her fork, and started eating lunch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige took out her mobile phone and shared her achievements during this period with Diana. "Look, these men's clothes are popular. You have to ensure the quality. There can't be any problems. Even any loose threads are not allowed. Consumers are very picky. We must do every detail well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana had expected that the sales of these men's clothes would be good. She immediately sent a message to Nolan, asking him to remind the factory manager to ensure the quality and not let any problems happen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked at the excited Paige and smiled, "Paige, after leaving Frank, you have become better."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige smiled, and she had completely let go of the past. "Not exactly. I was a hopeless romantic before. After I left Frank, I realized that the outside world is so wonderful. I've seen a lot, so I naturally would not dwell on the past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I was always anxious when I was with Frank, but after letting him go, I have an easy life and bright future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana thought the same way. After leaving Steven, she had a fulfilling and meaningful life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige and Diana chatted and ate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for Frank, he didn't look happy because Paula really didn't come to attend his wedding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not many guests came. There were only about one hundred people, including the Marsh family and Elsie's friends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank felt very embarrassed. After all, he was the second heir of the Marsh family, but there were only so few guests.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff and Queenie greeted the guests at the entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff didn't invite any influential people, just some relatives and friends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked outside in a rage. "What's wrong with Paula? She didn't even come to her son's wedding."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie frowned. She always thought Paula had known something.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="371.html">« Prev</a><a href="373.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
