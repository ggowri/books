"Joseph, what are you doing? It will be troublesome for you to come back later. This place is far from my home. It will take two hours to go back and forth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph was worried about Diana, fearing that the man would bully her again. "I'm worried about you, Diana. I'll send you back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his worried look, Diana smiled, "You don't have to worry about me. He won't do anything to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew that Steven was cruel, but he had always treated her coldly. He had slapped her twice when he was angry, but she had already gotten back at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph hesitated for a moment and couldn't help asking, "Diana, does he...treat you badly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, "Hmm. There are too many reasons. I'll tell you another time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph knew that she didn't want to say it, so he didn't continue asking. He really hoped that he could have his strength so that he could help Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana talked to Joseph about his studies. In her previous life, Joseph was an e-sports master, and his computer skills were superb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had taken advantage of Joseph's technology to steal many business secrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After getting his last value, Queenie simply abandoned him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's ending was quite tragic. Queenie would get rid of those people after they were of no use to her, especially those who questioned her actions and those who were unfaithful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie would cause all kinds of accidents and accidental deaths. Therefore, no one could suspect her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie harmed people, and Diana saved people. In this life, Diana wanted to live the way she liked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana and Joseph were very engaged in the conversation, and the topic touched upon Joseph's professional knowledge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time passed quickly. The car arrived at Diana's house. Diana smiled, "Joseph, would you like to come in and sit for a while?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph looked at the luxurious villa in front of him, shook his head, and said, "Maybe next time. You are tired today. I will come to see you in a few days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded. "Okay, let the driver send you back to the hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph smiled, "Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana went to open the door only after the car left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a dazzling light shone on her, and she raised her hand to block the glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car stopped. Diana saw the familiar license plate and got angry. She thought, "He is really annoying."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven got out of the car, exuding a sense of oppression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glanced at his cold eyes and then went into the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven quickly blocked the door and followed her in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned around and glared at him. "Mr. Gellar, are you disappointed that I am not dead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned, and his face turned cold. "Diana, you angered me first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sneered, "So what? It's not the first time you left me on the highway. Nothing happened the first time. I just walked for two hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I almost died this time, but you didn't do it. If you want to watch me die, I'll let you down. It's not the time. I'll watch you and Queenie die before me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was intense hatred in Diana's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of the pain she had suffered in her previous life, she really wanted to kill Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven clearly felt Diana's hatred towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These things he had done before broke Diana's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was also because of his indulgence that she was hurt so deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what he said, Diana would not believe him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven thought, "Even if Diana knew that Queenie made all these things, Diana would not forgive me, right?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="478.html">« Prev</a><a href="480.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
