"That was insane! A hundred-million-dollar car, and you just handed it over like it was nothing. You're unreal." Elroy lunged forward to hug Diana again. She watched his arms coming at her and, thinking about Steven's jealous face, quickly backed away&mdash;straight into Steven's chest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay, okay, I get that you're grateful, but you don't have to tackle me every time," Diana said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy was a mess, tears streaming down his face as he talked. "Diana, you're better to me than my own parents ever were. They'd never drop a hundred mil on a race car for me. They just think I'm some screw-up. I'm chasing my dream, but to them, I'm a total disappointment. Diana, you've got money to burn&mdash;you can't possibly understand what this feels like."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had no words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're pretty good at this whole rich kid thing though," he added. "Those Marsh brothers bailed halfway through, always talking big about racing but never even hit a real track."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, we need to get going. Call me if you need anything."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana wanted to see Hubery&mdash;it had been almost four years since they'd last met. Elroy knew better than to try and keep her. "Got it! Diana, you head out. When I get back home, we're meeting up&mdash;dinner's on me. You better show up."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy was always generous, and his smile was the real deal. Diana's lips curved slightly. "Elroy, you're nothing like what people say about you. Everyone thinks you're some spoiled brat who holds grudges, but you're actually pretty decent."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ha! You believe gossip? I only believe in legends."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Haha&mdash;" Diana laughed, genuinely happy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying goodbye to Elroy and his crew, Diana and Steven headed down the mountain. Diana took Steven to Hubery's office building&mdash;the whole thing was silver-white, gleaming like a beacon in the sunlight. She thought about that cheerful but bossy kid from back then, and a small smile tugged at her lips.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't bother with the front desk, just stood at the entrance and dialed the number she hadn't dared call in three years. The second the call connected, Diana's chest tightened and her whole body started shaking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hubery." She choked out through tears.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hubery sat in his top-floor office. He was devastatingly handsome with perfect posture and razor-sharp features. Even more striking than Steven, though where Steven was all ice and steel, Hubery had this warm, gentle quality. Put them together and they'd be lethal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stood by the window, staring out at the luxury high-rises beyond. His laugh was bitter. "Three years of radio silence, and the first thing you do when you call is cry. Diana, what the hell is that supposed to mean?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt like garbage. "Hubery, I'm sorry. I let you down. I came to find you&mdash;I'm downstairs at your building."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hubery's hand trembled around the phone. Three years&mdash;he'd actually come home every Christmas, secretly watching her from a distance. But seeing her looking so beaten down would piss him off enough to leave. Their pampered little princess, putting up with that kind of crap for so-called family loyalty. He couldn't stand watching someone so brilliant live like that. It made him sick, so he'd book a flight and get the hell out that same night.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Later, he stopped coming home for six months at a time. But that was Diana's choice. What right did he have to mess with her decisions? Whether she suffered or not was on her. She was already miserable&mdash;should he pile on as her brother and make it worse?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On her birthday, he finally got it. He didn't come back in person, but he still sent her a gift. He compromised. She called him Hubery in the group chat. (Hubery, thank you.)</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That "Hubery"&mdash;he'd been waiting forever to hear it. His voice shook slightly. "You're heartless."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana: "Hubery, I was wrong. Hubery, it's so hot, I'm about to pass out from the heat."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hubery's voice carried urgency: "Go wait in the lobby, I'll be right down."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana hung up and looked up to meet Steven's puzzled gaze: "Diana, are you hot?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The weather was still a bit cool today. Diana glared at him: "Steven, do you know why my brother Hubery left and never came home? It's because you all bullied me. He couldn't stand seeing me wronged, so he left in anger and hasn't been back for three Christmases."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Whenever I feel wronged or cry out in pain, he immediately runs to my side. I gave up such a wonderful brother to come to you all, just wanting a little warmth, but none of you were willing to give it to me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've regretted it countless times, hurting the person who treated me best for your sake."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Every time I think about it, I want to kill myself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you know how good my brother is to me? He knows I love racing, so he searches the world for the best race cars and puts them in my garage."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He doesn't just spoil me with words - he actually does it. Most of the money he earns, he spends on me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I had been a good girl, I would've been the happiest little princess in this lifetime."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's breathing trembled, and he said nothing more. At this moment, he truly wished they could both lose their memories and stop bringing up the past. Every time the past came up, she got emotional, and he fell into endless guilt. "I understand. When I see him later, I'll apologize to him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd heard from Julius that on their wedding night, Hubery was right outside the bridal suite, watching him go find Queenie. Actually, he never went to find Queenie at all - he just didn't want to hurt Diana, so he went to the office to work overtime. That was the most critical time for the company, and he didn't dare slack off even a bit. What was there worth finding in that woman Queenie? But these explanations were meaningless now - hurt was hurt.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven heard a gentle, surprised call and saw Diana being embraced by a tall figure. Steven looked over, and that stunningly handsome face made him pause slightly. The three Bishop brothers were all exceptionally good-looking, each with the bearing of gods among men.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hubery's hand quickly touched her forehead, asking nervously: "Where don't you feel well? Let's go to the hospital."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His voice was gentle but hoarse, full of concern. Diana leaned into his embrace, saying softly: "Hubery, just seeing you makes me feel better."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only then did Hubery realize she was doing it on purpose. He helplessly pinched her cheek: "You're still just as mischievous."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking up to see Steven standing nearby, his expression instantly darkened: "What's he doing here?" His icy tone carried the lethal edge honed from years in the business world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nervously grabbed Hubery's hand: "Hubery, he's my husband now. He's turned over a new leaf - the person he loves is me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hubery was furious: "Diana, do you really have to put up with his crap? Can you forget all the hurt you suffered before?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1167.html">« Prev</a><a href="1169.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
