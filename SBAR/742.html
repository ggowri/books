She owned an entertainment company herself, which was how she had learned about Zion back in the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Queenie's luck wouldn't run out so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana believed her own future would keep getting brighter. Knowing Queenie aimed to break into the entertainment industry, she wanted to go head-to-head with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the resort project stabilized after Christmas, she planned to dive into this herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sensed that the man supporting Queenie had eyes on them, watching their every move.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man's team was a collection of experts. There were scholars, consultants, and specialists from different fields. They excelled at strategizing and problem-solving.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of this, they had to tread carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's strategy was to act only on occasion, aiming to lure them into making a mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, after Diana became pregnant, Steven had imprisoned her for three months. During that time, much had happened, but she could only gather glimpses of the outside world from the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, news reports could be deceiving.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was sitting in her office, lost in thought when she suddenly received a message from Luna.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Diana, Amelie and Queenie just set off on a boat trip.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glanced out the window at the weather and immediately understood what Queenie was planning.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that Queenie intended to terminate the pregnancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter who the father was, that child's existence would jeopardize Queenie's future.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head, thinking Queenie was truly ruthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She messaged Luna back.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Luna, send someone to follow them and keep the evidence.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna replied: [Diana, I'll go myself.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana responded: [You can't. Queenie knows you're my associate. If she sees you, she won't hesitate to get rid of you. Just send one of our bodyguards.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna replied: [Understood!]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that it was still early, Diana decided to visit Lily at the hospital. She wanted to talk to her, hoping Lily might wake up soon. Diana knew Mark would take advantage of Lily's coma to go after her parents' assets.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grabbed her phone and car keys, left the office, and took the elevator down to the parking garage.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chilly wind blew through the underground lot, and she pulled her down jacket tighter around herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once in the car, she turned on the heat, feeling a rush of warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Starting the car, she drove out of the garage.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she arrived at the hospital, she first visited Micah and then headed to Lily's room.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's frostbitten face had taken on a darkened hue, and her features now twisted from the damage. Despite using the best medicines, the necrotic tissue had already begun to peel.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana held a hand warmer to heat her hands, and once they were warm, she took Lily's hand and smiled, saying, "Lily, I came to see you again. It's so cold outside. I hate winter. I hate the cold. Winter always makes me want to hibernate.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, I love spring. Flowers bloom everywhere, and everything comes to life again..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana continued talking, losing track of time, as a tear slipped from the corner of Lily's eye, her eyelids twitching slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana noticed and gave a gentle smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, I don't know what happened to you that night. I know you're choosing not to wake up. But no pain is insurmountable. Think of your daughter, think of your parents. We might be able to live without men, but we can't live without our family."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="741.html">« Prev</a><a href="743.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
