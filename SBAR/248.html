Raised with privilege, Gale found his sister embarrassing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He believed she would bring disgrace to the family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But what had Diana done wrong? She was switched at birth. If she hadn't been, she'd surely be accomplished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No, she was already accomplished; they had just never noticed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They had fallen into Queenie and Jeff's trap, raised deliberately to fail, molded into arrogance and superficiality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea had put it bluntly. "Gale, you're a complete idiot. I'll never love a worthless fool like you again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had thought Diana was shameful, but now he realized the shameful one was himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie schemed against Diana over and over, and with each plot, their hearts' scales began to tip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Disgust was contagious. When everyone around you hated someone, you assumed it was because she was truly wicked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only now did he realize that when the knife was turned on him, it hurt, and he wasn't so magnanimous after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When his sister was framed, there was loneliness and helplessness in her eyes. He had always thought she was just trying to gain sympathy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now he understood that she was genuinely hurt. Her biological mother didn't believe her, and her brothers bullied her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wasn't fit to be her brother. No wonder she was skilled in medicine and could treat people worse off than him, yet she never mentioned it in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Gale speechless and still crying, Paula continued, "If I hadn't given you shares, what would you do if I fell one day? You don't know anything except racing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale was confused. He asked, "Mom, I don't understand why Dad is doing this to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula said, "I can't tell you the truth. You've always been foolish; I'm afraid you'll ruin my plans.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Pretend you know nothing. Find a hospital and hide. I'll handle everything else," she instructed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, I see the truth now. I won't drag you down. Please tell me. Penelope's child isn't mine; she just wants to use me. I won't let her succeed. I'm your son, and I won't side with Dad or that woman, Queenie," Gale said, wanting to share some of the burden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula looked at him quietly. "Then seek revenge yourself. As long as you're not foolish, I won't abandon you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As long as her son was willing to change, she would help him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale gave a bitter smile. "Mom, I'm not foolish anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana's design landed in Emma's hands three days before the race. Queenie was the only one who had access to my phone and knew the unlock code.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now I understand that Queenie wanted to completely turn me against Diana and frame her for my crash. Luckily, Diana saw it coming and stopped Queenie from succeeding."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula felt deeply saddened. "Diana cared so much about us that she never exposed Queenie. She loves this family too; that's why she didn't contradict Queenie. She just wanted everyone to be at peace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The last time, Queenie staged her own kidnapping to frame Diana. We wanted to cut ties with her, leaving her completely heartbroken and making her stop loving us. We were truly blind."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tears streamed down Paula's face. "People only learn to cherish when they've lost. I've already lost my daughter, and I've prepared myself to lose all four of you brothers as well."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="247.html">« Prev</a><a href="249.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
