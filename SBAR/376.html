The last calmness seemed to be shattered in an instant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That cold voice was like a bolt from the blue. Elsie stood there in a daze and stared blankly at the man who was walking into the venue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was a little girl next to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie knew that she was doomed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at the man who was gradually approaching, she stared at him blankly, and the flesh of her face was faintly trembling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige smiled and sent a message, asking someone to display something more exciting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, the wedding photos of Elsie and a man appeared on the big screen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The guests looked at these photos carefully and found that the man was the one who had just walked into the venue with a little girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man was Harley Ford. He was dressed simply. He looked at Elsie, uncontrollable anger surging in his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The pent-up anger suddenly erupted like a volcano. Ford roared, "Elsie, you haven't even divorced me yet. How can you divorce your current husband and divide his property?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His words echoed throughout the venue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Harley looked at Frank and said sarcastically, "Elsie has deceived men for many times. She married them and ran away after getting the money. Mr. Marsh, look at her wedding photos with me. Do you think the video is fake?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank blinked, tears flowing down his face. It turned out that everything was fake. His face was pale, and his chest heaved violently. He stared at Elsie with resentment in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He angrily slapped Elsie and yelled, "Marital fraud? Elsie, how dare you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie sneered, "So what, idiot? I've been keeping you in suspense, and you still pursued me for a year. It's not my fault. Someone wants to set you up, and you are too stupid."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie knew that she was doomed this time, and the most urgent thing was to run away. She had already transferred all the money Frank had given her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She turned and looked at Harley with sarcasm in her eyes. "Harley, you are a loser. If you hadn't come back and fought with your eldest brother for the property, would I have abandoned you and my daughter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Harley ignored Elsie and looked down at his daughter, who was in tears. "Macy, do you still want her to be your mother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Macy Ford, Harley's daughter, shook her head and said with tears in her eyes, "Dad, I don't want a mother like her. Dad, I have a new mother now. I like her very much, and she treats me very well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The children's words were simple but hurtful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Elsie heard that Macy had recognized another woman as her mother, she was furious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie shouted, "Humph, you are so ungrateful. If you were a son, I would have been able to get a foothold in the Ford family, but you are a daughter. How dare you show up in front of me? You even recognized another woman as your mother. You brat!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Harley had been covering Macy's ears. When he heard what Elsie said, his eyes were cold. "Elsie, I brought Macy to see you for the last time. You can never see her again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying this, Harley took Macy's hand and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff was so angry that he found it difficult to breathe. It was so embarrassing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although he knew the plan, Frank was his son. It was really embarrassing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The guests were whispering, "This woman is so vicious. She abandoned her husband and daughter for wealth."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah. That poor girl. If she were a boy, her mother would have relied on her for the rest of her life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Marsh family is unfortunate. They actually have been targeted by such a vicious woman."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Frank is so unlucky. The woman he was going to marry was so shameless. Look at her arrogant and cheeky face. Tsk, shame on her. Why didn't she just live a peaceful life?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The venue was in chaos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank's grandparents were ashamed and angry. They wanted to leave as soon as possible. Listening to the guests' whispers, they didn't have the nerve to retort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They felt very embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank calmed down, suppressed his anger, and looked at guests. He said, "I'm sorry, everyone. The wedding is cancelled. The gifts will be returned to you later. The food has been prepared next door. Please go there to have lunch."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Elsie was furious. She yelled, "Frank, is this all your love for me? Although I have been married and have a child, don't you love me?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="375.html">« Prev</a><a href="377.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
