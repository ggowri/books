Go back and get some rest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana nodded. "Okay! I am fine. It was just an accident tonight. Don't overthink it when you go back, and get some sleep."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#8203;She lowered her eyes in anger. She knew it was not an accident and that those men were sent by Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only she would have such an evil idea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan sent Paige back to the hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#8203;Steven and Diana stayed at the same hotel and went back together.&#8203;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#8203;Mario, who was not far away, watched them leave with vexation. Steven had actually saved Diana.&#8203;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stood under a coconut tree and made a call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sir, Steven might not divorce Diana for the time being, nor will he marry Ms. Marsh. Should we change our plan? Steven is unwilling to dump Diana, and she has moved out for several months.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What Ms. Marsh did before was discovered by him, and his attitude towards her was lukewarm."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man on the other end of the phone said in a low voice, "Don't worry. Queenie has a way to make Steven compromise. The hypnotist has arrived. Queenie's method is very good."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mario replied, "Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Steven and Diana reached the hotel, she said, "Mr. Gellar, thank you for your help tonight!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He frowned and stared at her. She was striking and attractive. "Diana, I remember that during the two years we were together, you always gently called me Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"However, you call me Mr. Gellar indifferently." His tone gradually became cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's face was expressionless. "Mr. Gellar, the past is in the past. My affection for you died at Queenie's birthday party. Because of your slap, we have no choice but to divorce."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In this life, she really didn't want to be killed in a few months.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana pivoted around to open the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven suddenly grabbed her hand and pulled her into his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was stunned. She seldom got close to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The nearest distance between them was only three steps.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana glanced up and met Steven's deep eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She instantly struggled, but he held her tightly. "Diana, you are still my wife."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, he bent his head and kissed her on the lips.&#8203;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#8203;His breath was hot, but she felt sick.&#8203;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#8203;Why did he kiss her with the same lips with which he had kissed Queenie?&#8203;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana turned her head and slapped Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He gazed at her with a frown. "Did you slap me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#8203;He was exercising his rights as a husband.&#8203;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#8203;Diana took a step back in disgust and glared at him. "Mr. Gellar, don't you think it's nauseous? You love Queenie and have slept with her, but you kissed me with the same lips that you kissed her. You don't feel sick, but I do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, Steven, you bastard, that was my first kiss."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven, I'm back." Queenie suddenly appeared and interrupted Steven. She walked over and took his arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at her coldly, Diana raised her cell phone and took a few photos of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie immediately let go of Steven and shouted excitedly, "Diana, what are you doing? Why are you taking photos?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="396.html">« Prev</a><a href="398.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
