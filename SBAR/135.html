Don't you want to eat snacks? I'll take you to eat some. Eating can make people feel better."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana shook his head and said, "I'm fine. These things can't hurt me now. I will wait until Queenie is ruined and isolated. I have evidence of her framing me all these years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I want to take back what she owes me bit by bit. I want to tear that wolf skin off her body."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Who was the man supporting Queenie?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was also a computer expert. She knew that the photos Queenie sent her were not synthesized, which was why she quarreled with Queenie and was fooled every time, making Steven think that she was extremely vicious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Olivia, let's go. I have let it go now. I won't be sad about this matter. I just want to find out some things in the past."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There were a lot of secrets behind Queenie. She didn't see who that powerful killer was in her previous life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And who was the man Queenie liked?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">These had not been clarified.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie's bragging tonight reminded her of some things. Queenie took Steven's money and secretly set up her own company, which allowed her to easily acquire the Barnes family after Paula went crazy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Farley family also fell into her hands easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Farley family fell into her hands because that man came back and conspired with Queenie to plot against the Farley family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Judging from the time, the man should have returned after Gale got into trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">While Diana was thinking, Olivia drove to the back street.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Steven came down, he saw that Diana had already left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He got into a car on the side of the road and sent two photos and a video to Evan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan was stunned for a moment when he saw the photos and videos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Gellar, these are nude photos of you and Ms. Marsh... Why did you send them to me? It's inappropriate for me to look at them. I don't dare to look at them." Evan was frightened and his voice was stuttering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven and Queenie were together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven cheated on Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven glanced at him coldly with deep eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan suddenly felt a chill on his back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"The video is real, but the man in it is not me. Have a secret investigation. I found that the man looks exactly like me," Steven said in a hoarse voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan was stunned, but now he dared to look carefully. He clicked on a video and watched the video of the two of them in the hotel and the video of the villa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But the common thing was that all the places with logos were blurred, except for the two people in bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Gellar, both of us have good computer skills. This video is not synthesized. Even AI can't make such a realistic video.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"The man in the video only showed his face, but he looks the same as you, there is not much difference. Do you have a twin brother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven glanced at him and said, "Do you think it's possible? My parents don't get along, and I'm their only child. I can't have a twin brother."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven thought of what Diana and Cecil said that night, and a hint of murderous intent flashed across his eyes. "It doesn't matter if we can't find out. In a year, if this man exists, he will show up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Who was this man who looked exactly like him?</p><div class="pagination"><a href="134.html">« Prev</a><a href="136.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
