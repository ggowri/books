She said, &quot;Yes. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. His health is getting worse day by day. He also should pay the price for what he did in the past.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She had experienced happiness over these years. But right because she had been so happy, she felt much more intense pain upon learning of his betrayal.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her blind devotion backfired, turning her into a laughingstock.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Only after a real failure did she realize that reputation was something dispensable.</p><p style="text-align:left;">So what if her reputation was ruined?</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was just a matter of being laughed at by others.</p><p style="text-align:left;">So what if she were mocked for being down and out? After all, she was not living with others. Nothing was more important than living happily herself.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She wouldn&#x27;t have looked down upon the daughter she brought back from the countryside if she didn&#x27;t care about reputation. The extent to which she despised Diana at that time was exactly proportional to the humiliation she was experiencing now.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A few months ago, Diana was still the country girl that everyone looked down upon.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But now and in the future, she was bound to hold great power in the business world.</p><p style="text-align:left;">*****</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie locked herself up in the room after she got home.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She curled up in the quilt and cried her heart out.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Apart from her heart-wrenching sobs, all that could be heard was the spring breeze howling past the window. The wind was so strong that it made people feel flustered.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She cried for half an hour. Perhaps she was too exhausted, so she fell into a deep sleep and had a dream.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Waking up, her eyes were red and swollen. The pink bedspread set off her rosy face. She stared blankly at the ceiling. The scenes that happened today emerged in her dream.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But in the dream, it was other companies that appeared, not hers.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Another scene appeared. With her help, George bought a piece of land under Elroy&#x27;s name at a very low price. Finally, they developed a hot spring resort, which brought them huge profits.</p><p style="text-align:left;">However, she was one step too late because the land was under Diana&#x27;s name.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Moreover, it was Eric who made it happen.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She also offered some help. If she had gone to save Eric that night, Diana would not have gone to his rescue. Then, she wouldn&#x27;t have had the chance to buy the land from Elroy.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She collapsed and screamed, &quot;Why?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Why did Diana take everything away from her?</p><p style="text-align:left;">She sat up suddenly and shouted, &quot;Why?&quot; She wouldn&#x27;t accept this. In her dream, Cecil, Steven, Diana, and her four stupid brothers all died a violent death, shattered to pieces.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula was left with nothing and ended up as a mental patient.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Then she died in the hospital.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Especially Diana and Cecil; they were the ones who died the most miserably.</p><p style="text-align:left;">How did everything change?</p><p style="text-align:left;">She scratched her head in agony. In her dream, she successfully won Steven&#x27;s love. He was self-disciplined and adhered to propriety, earning the respect of all. To all women, this Capitole tycoon seemed unattainable.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But in reality, she squandered a winning hand.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She was in great pain.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She took a deep breath, threw back the quilt, slowly got out of bed, and then stood up only to sit back on the bed. Only then did she realize that she was so exhausted that she could barely stand steadily.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A thought came up in her mind that she should visit the temple in her dream. What happened in the dream felt far too real.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She tried hard to breathe, gathering some strength before heading to the bathroom to shower.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After washing up, she glanced out of the window. It has already grown dark.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her face was blank as she gazed at the illuminated world outside the window. Meanwhile, her heart plummeted into the depths of despair.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was impossible to get compensation for digging out cultural relics.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She stood silently by the window for a long time. A cold wind blew in, and she finally made a decision.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Rather than being forced to suspend work, it was better to use this opportunity to build a good reputation.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In this country, cultural relics are extremely important. Projects where ancient tombs were unearthed couldn&#x27;t be developed. This was based on the protection of historical and cultural heritage rather than resolving the issue through compensation.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was their responsibility to protect cultural relics and historical sites such as ancient tombs. It was also an important measure to inherit and promote an excellent culture.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She gave a cold laugh. It was just a few hundred million dollars.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She always believed that what was lost would return in another way.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Back to bed, she saw George call her over a dozen times but chose to ignore them.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Love was no longer everything to her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">At this moment, all she wanted was money, power, and a career.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She had misjudged that coward, George. Even though he looked exactly like Steven, he didn&#x27;t have much ability.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was Steven&#x27;s loss. More regrettable was that when a person passes away, everything will be gone.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Everything turned out to be Diana&#x27;s.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She was extremely heartbroken but could do nothing to change the outcome.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Just then, she saw the message Mario sent her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">[Ms. Marsh, we have discovered three ancient tombs in total. The underground palace is huge. The losses caused by the suspension of work include labor costs, machinery costs, material costs, etc. The relevant unit replied that only these costs will be compensated, and there are no other costs.]</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie knew this would be the result.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She quickly called Mario back.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Mario said, full of tenderness and pity, &quot;Ms. Marsh, are you okay?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">A warm feeling welled up deep in her heart. This man was the only one who had been sincere to her from the beginning. She replied, &quot;Mario, I&#x27;m fine. Go and negotiate with the relevant departments. We don&#x27;t want any compensation, but we need them to publish a news article indicating that we have selflessly handed over all the cultural relics.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Mario instantly understood what she meant. Companies needed to build a good reputation.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Mario said, &quot;Ms. Marsh, I see. I&#x27;ll go negotiate with them right now. Don&#x27;t worry. We&#x27;ll earn back this money soon.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie also had such confidence. She said, &quot;Mario, you are all I have now. You need to deal with things in Diana&#x27;s laboratory promptly.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Mario smiled, &quot;Ms. Marsh, trust me. I will give you a surprise. I can guarantee that Diana&#x27;s AI-assisted diagnosis system will not be successfully launched on the market. I&#x27;ll never let that happen.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She knew his loyalty to her. She said with a light and charming smile, &quot;Alright. Mario, you know that I trust you. After all this, I will give you a reward you&#x27;ve been longing for.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Mario was slightly stunned, then said with great excitement, &quot;Ms. Marsh, I don&#x27;t need anything. I just want to stay by your side.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She knew what was on his mind and how to control him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">George could be surrounded by women. Why couldn&#x27;t she?</p><p style="text-align:left;">She said, &quot;Mario, I know what you mean. You are the only one who loves me.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Mario was very excited, and he said, &quot;Ms. Marsh, I need to do my job. And I&#x27;ll call you when I&#x27;m done.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">His voice turned gentle involuntarily.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie was both his fated tribulation and his destined bond.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She hung up the phone with a smile and whispered, &quot;Sure.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her cell phone rang again. It was her mother calling. She said with an extremely cold look on her face, &quot;Hello!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Amelie cried, &quot;Queenie, come here now. Your father is in the hospital.&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="1012.html">« Prev</a><a href="1014.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
