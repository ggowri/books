Can't I do this?" Steven gazed at her bewildered expression, finding an unexpected charm in it. Her crimson lips slightly parted, stirring a desire within him to kiss her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Snapping back to reality, Diana clenched her fists. "Don't you avoid pungent foods? You can actually eat these."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven replied, "Sure, but you'll need to have some stomach medicine ready for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Consuming such fare was no easy task for his digestion, often leading to discomfort and stomach issues.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn't help but think, "Was he insane? Why subject himself to pain when he knew the outcome?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadn't he noticed the clear discomfort his presence caused among us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can't handle it, don't force yourself. Eat something else. I'm out for fun and didn't bring any stomach medicine."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven smoothly countered, "No worries. There's a pharmacy downstairs."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was momentarily at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven gestured for Evan to take a seat and then called over a waiter to place their order.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Observing his persistence, she chose to remain silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This year, Steven made it onto the list of the wealthy, and his vast fortune inspired awe in everyone around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea and Paige were visibly surprised, too intimidated to voice any offense.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mustering her courage, Althea asked, "Mr. Gellar, shouldn't you be with Queenie? I heard she was so angry she fainted. She's your sweetheart, isn't she?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get something straight. I may have been kind to Queenie before, but she was never my sweetheart."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven coldly interrupted Althea.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was indifferent to whether Queenie survived or not. He hoped it would force the man behind Queenie to reveal himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had considered taking advantage of the situation, but it was futile. The man was too crafty, leaving no trace for Steven to follow.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this stalemate, he decided to keep a calculated distance from Queenie, observing from the sidelines to catch that man.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea pouted, thinking that Steven was telling a lie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige, however, kept her lips sealed. In her view, Steven and Frank were two peas in a pod, nothing but scoundrels.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once lighthearted atmosphere grew solemn with the arrival of Steven and Evan.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as the barbecue arrived, Paige's spirits lifted, rekindling the jovial mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, roast beef! It's been ages since I've had this. Diana, the last time was, well, the last time. I've been starving myself this year to lose weight."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana chuckled, "If you drink the coffee I gave you, you'll slim down in no time. After a feast like this, make yourself a cup when you get home. It'll cut the grease and spare your stomach."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Paige and Althea had sampled Diana's special coffee. Althea inquired, "Diana, have you ever thought about selling your coffee on the market? It would be a godsend for anyone trying to lose weight."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige agreed, finding the effects remarkable.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled and shook her head. "I couldn't do that. The ingredients are too rare and expensive. It might not even be feasible to produce it."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She declined the idea. The process of making such coffee was laborious. It was fine for personal consumption, but the thought of selling it filled her with apprehension. She had no desire to burden herself with such a task.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven, however, was intrigued. "Diana, what kind of coffee is this?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="769.html">« Prev</a><a href="771.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
