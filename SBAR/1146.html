Although she was angry, he was her teenage dream, her love from youth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because of his family's indifference, he carried too many responsibilities.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, they wouldn't have been entangled for so long.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana has always loved Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana gently held Steven's waist, rested her head on his chest, and softly said, "Steven, my love, even if it takes all my strength to get a slight response, I would feel so happy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This lifetime, I hope we can walk slowly and see farther scenery."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana didn't mention growing old together because the future is uncertain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They still have family destiny issues unresolved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her gentle and sweet demeanor. When she stayed silent, she was obedient and quiet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He would accompany her with sincerity and passionate love.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, when you're by my side, I've never envied anyone else."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Steven took a small step back, gazed at her intently, and said, "Diana Bishop."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've always loved you. You can keep asking me to confirm."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana knew she could read his feelings in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her with deep affection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was no longer as restrained as before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop talking. If you keep going, I'll be moved to forgive you. You know I'm soft-hearted, even though you've done so many wrong things, I still forgive you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven didn't continue the topic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his personality, he couldn't have said those words earlier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when emotions run deep, he can easily say those words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven held her hand and said, "Come on, let's go have lunch."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was already hungry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hurry up, I'm starving."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana walked even faster than Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled and couldn't help but glance at her belly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After going downstairs, they went straight to the restaurant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The dining table in the restaurant was set with exquisite dishes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These dishes were obviously not made by Luna.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven explained, "Diana, from now on, don't worry about kitchen work. I've hired a chef. The chef will only show up to cook and won't disturb our lives. The housekeeper will also come to clean when we're not home, so it won't affect us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't bear to see her work hard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "Alright! I'll move back to stay with Leopold in a while."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then I'll go back too. Leopold likes me a lot."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven pulled out the chair for her to sit and eat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana started with beef ribs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Enjoying delicious food feels so good."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven sat beside her and served her chicken soup.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, have some chicken soup first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought about last night and got angry. "Alright! You eat quickly too. After we finish, let's find out who drugged us last night."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "Evan has already started investigating. They'll come over later, and we'll find out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana suddenly looked at him and said, "Later, you go see Evan yourself. I won't go out for the next three days, and I don't want to see anyone."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yesterday's incident must be known to everyone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone knows Steven and she slept together last night.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven didn't expect her to be so shy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Alright! I'll handle it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After lunch, Diana really didn't go out; she went upstairs to rest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven watched her lie down to sleep before letting Evan come over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan sat down, looked around, and didn't see Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was a bit worried and asked softly, "Mr. Gellar, is Mrs. Gellar upset?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled, "We're a couple. Why would Diana be upset?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan smiled. "That's good."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "What happened last night?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those people, though they helped him, were also quite hateful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan said, "We found the waiter who spilled wine all over Mrs. Gellar. Under pressure, he admitted someone gave him $50,000 to deliberately spill the drink on Mrs. Gellar. When she went to change clothes, he took the chance to drug her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He doesn't know much. They met in the dark. He didn't see what the other person looked like."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, the progesterone you kicked broke last night, and she's still in the hospital receiving treatment."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The only clue is Zach, who blocked you. He was afraid we'd go after him and admitted it was Queenie who sent them to bother you. Their original plan was to keep you occupied and then have someone take Mrs. Gellar away."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan smiled helplessly and said, "Mr. Gellar, they really underestimated us. Do we really look that useless?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "Do you think you're so great? If you were useful, why did we fall for it last night?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan smiled apologetically.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, we can be sure last night's scheme was arranged by Queenie, but unfortunately, there's no evidence."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said coldly, "No evidence? I can still punish her. Speed up your actions recently and destroy all her secret companies."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Set a trap for Mario. I want him to spend the rest of his life in prison."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan said, "Mr. Gellar, Joseph said Mario has his own plans. Let's wait a bit longer."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven thought of the way Joseph looked at Diana and got inexplicably angry. "What plans could he possibly have?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was jealous of Joseph.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Joseph has many merits, apart from his poor family background.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled, "Mr. Gellar, under Mrs. Gellar's arrangements, Joseph has grown quickly, and his career is now going smoothly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven sneered and said, "Looks like you want to find another place to stay."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan pretended not to understand and asked, "Mr. Gellar, what do you mean?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1145.html">« Prev</a><a href="1147.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
