Queenie asked sweetly as usual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan chuckled coldly at this. "Ms. Marsh, you're supposed to be my boss' childhood sweetheart, right? Everyone thinks that. And yet, you don't even know what he likes? Some childhood friend you are."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Evan, you..." Queenie was left speechless by his retort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I really don't know what he likes. You know how distant he is. He's always been the one taking care of me, knowing what I like to eat...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"So, my boss has been giving all this time, and yet you can't even remember what he likes to eat?" Evan teased her, laughing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Evan, stop it. I'll make an effort to remember what Steven likes from now on," Queenie replied, her tone much softer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She didn't really care about what a man like Steven liked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was as dull as a devil.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What she liked was the millions he gave her as spending money and the prestige she enjoyed through him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Steven had no idea she had actually met Diana that year.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven had always believed it was her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She knew that no secret lasted forever. One day, Steven would find out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With Diana's rebellious attitude these days, it was only a matter of time before she told Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">By the time Steven found out, he would have already outlived his usefulness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan laughed. "Ms. Marsh, yes, Mr. Gellar loves pumpkin soup, but not just anyone can make it the way he likes. Only Mrs. Gellar can make it just right."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I can do it too. I'll bring some over for Steven tomorrow," Queenie said before hanging up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan was in the backyard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He sent the recording to Steven, hoping to infuriate him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He spoiled Queenie, yet she didn't even know what he liked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">No one waits forever unless fate intervenes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, Steven was in his study, working.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He habitually reached for his water, only to find that the spot where the cup usually sat was empty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven froze, his exhaustion weighing heavily on him. When Diana was home, there would always be a cup of soothing drink beside him while he worked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After drinking it, he'd sleep well at night, with no more restless dreams or insomnia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But ever since Diana left, he hadn't had her soothing drink, and he had been plagued by sleepless nights.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana understood black medicine and had kept him in great health.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His gaze darkened as he thought about what had happened at the mall tonight, a wave of unexplained irritation building within him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He realized that he had forgotten to give Diana her living expenses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was so obedient. She never asked for anything, except when it came to his relationship with Queenie. Then, she would argue. Otherwise, she was always the perfect wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She kept the house perfectly in order.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Queenie returned, everything changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She cared, which was why she fought with him. He had crossed her line by staying with Queenie for too long, and ultimately, he made her lose all hope and leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Earlier that day, as he scrolled through videos, he came across a recommended novel that strangely resembled his current situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just as he was deep in thought, his phone vibrated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan sent over a recording.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="137.html">« Prev</a><a href="139.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
