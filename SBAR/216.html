"Mr. Gellar, I... They..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What a damn woman! Why did she record the video?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She couldn't defend herself now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan stepped forward with a straight face. "Go to the human resources department, get your salary, and leave right away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No! Ms. Marsh, please help me. I don't want to quit my job. It's your order. You've said you are Mr. Gellar's wife and that I can stop any woman who comes to see him. You've also promised to handle the consequences."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How dare she sell her out!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven, I didn't give her such an order, but you did promise me that I could come and go freely. It's despicable of her to frame me like this just to stay here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven didn't even glance at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan beckoned the bodyguards over, and they lifted the receptionist. He ordered, "Apologize to Ms. Bishop, and then you can get back at the mastermind."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In despair, the receptionist gazed at Diana, bowed her head, and apologized, "I'm sorry! Ms. Bishop, I was wrong. I won't dare to do it again. Please let me off this time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled at her calmly, "You are willing to be a pawn, and you indeed annoyed me. I am not like your mastermind, who will only pass the buck when something goes wrong. I won't accept your apology. Get out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The receptionist screamed in a panic. The salaries and benefits at the Gellar Group were the best in Capitole.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She still had a mortgage to pay and couldn't lose her job.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She cried in front of Diana, begging, "Ms. Bishop, I am really sorry. I said the wrong thing. Please forgive me this time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana stared down at her. "I'm not that forgiving. I will hold grudges and seek revenge. Go to the mastermind. Since you are stupid, don't try to plot against others."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan gestured for the bodyguards to take the receptionist away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie stamped her feet in anger. "Diana, you are heartless, aren't you? She even apologized and begged you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana sneered, "You are warm-hearted, but why didn't you help her? Why do you pretend to be kind now? Didn't you brush your teeth when you came out this morning? Your mouth stinks." Diana didn't give her any face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You... Diana, you are simply unreasonable." Queenie was furious. Why did Diana become so sharp-tongued?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do you mean? Aren't you being unreasonable? You had a deal with the receptionist and deliberately made things difficult for me. Do you think you are being reasonable?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's cold voice was very penetrating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven, she..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Get out of the way. If you want to flirt with him, do it until I'm gone because it will disgust me," Diana interrupted her angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next, she was going to deal with Emma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie suddenly widened her eyes in astonishment. Diana was simply humiliating her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before she could retort, Diana continued, "Steven, I'm here to see Emma, the design director of your company. The new products you announced this morning are based on design drawings Gale secretly took in my office half a month ago. I still have the torn draft. You have stolen my designs. Although legal action is not available, I will never let Emma off. Will you call her downstairs to let me beat her up, or do you want me to call the police?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="215.html">« Prev</a><a href="217.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
