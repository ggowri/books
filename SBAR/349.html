It was Joseph. She remembered that Joseph's skills were beyond those of ordinary hackers.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought, "He didn't have a good ending in my previous life. In this life, I met him in advance. I hope he will have a good ending."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana replied to his message.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[That's good. This minimally invasive surgery won't cause much harm to your grandma's body, and it's not likely to recur. Take good care of your grandma. If you need any help, feel free to call me.]</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph saw the message from Diana and smiled brightly, thinking, "Diana, just wait for me for two years. I will definitely help you."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana didn't know what Joseph was thinking. All she wanted was to drag Queenie to hell and take revenge. As for the fate of other people, she would try to save as many as she could.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the afternoon, she got off work and just walked out of the door when she met Frank and Elsie, who came to see her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana felt uncomfortable after seeing these two.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank handed a wedding invitation to Diana. "Diana, my wedding is coming soon. After all, you are my biological sister..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't give it to me. I won't attend. I have nothing to do with the Marsh family anymore."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's cold voice interrupted Frank.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was angry. "Diana, why are you so stubborn? I have personally come to invite you. What else are you not satisfied with?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana thought he was sick. She smiled sarcastically, "Frank, what do you want me to do to satisfy you? You said that I am not allowed to say that I am your family member outside. Now you want to invite me to your wedding for this reason.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since you hate me so much, why did you invite me? To make things difficult for you?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie said aggrievedly, "Diana, don't say that. He is your biological brother..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana interrupted her again, "Stop it. Will my biological brother secretly plot against me? Will my biological brother label me with the most vicious stigma in the world for no reason? Get out! Don't disgust me."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Diana strode away.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was annoyed. "Diana, don't be shameless. It's your honor that I personally come to invite you."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana didn't even bother to pay attention to him and just walked to the roadside.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie was sad and whispered, "Frank, let's go. Diana probably doesn't like people like me, so she won't attend our wedding."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was furious. He felt that it was unfair for Diana to have slandered her reputation, so he came to invite her. But she was unwilling to go.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Elsie, it has nothing to do with you. Let's go. It doesn't matter if she doesn't want to go. Gale and my other brothers can't attend, but my father and Queenie will go, and so will my grandparents."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie then nodded happily.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Frank, go back first. We are getting married. I need to go out alone to buy some things. I will contact you later."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was a little confused. "Let me go with you. What do you want to buy?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie smiled, "Don't. It's just some small decorations for the room. I want to buy some to decorate the house. Don't you have an appointment tonight? Go ahead, and I'll go buy them."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank didn't hesitate anymore. Thinking of Diana's attitude, he felt that he had bullied Diana too much, so she had such an attitude.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "I should be nicer to Diana in the future."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Watching Elsie leave, he called Diana again.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana had already got into the car. She had an appointment with Cecil tonight.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Frank calling her, she answered it and said, "Hello!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank quickly said, "Diana, I will treat you better in the future. Once you quit your position as the chief designer and don't go against Queenie, I won't bully you anymore."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was furious at his words.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She shouted angrily, "Frank, you fucking bastard! What qualifications do you have to dictate my life?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="348.html">« Prev</a><a href="350.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
