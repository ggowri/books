Then, she asked, &quot;Mrs. Marsh, have you gone for a paternity test?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula said angrily, &quot;Yes. But things are not as you said. Queenie is not your father&#x27;s daughter.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana looked at Paula and felt that Paula was a failure as a person, living in deception of others all her life.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Anyway, whether Paula believed it or not, it had nothing to do with Diana.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She thought, &quot;When I was kidnapped that year, all of them stood on Queenie&#x27;s side.</p><p style="text-align:left;">This family had no feelings for me at all, and I was the only one who was stupid enough to give up on the people who loved me the most.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In this life, I will protect those who love me.</p><p style="text-align:left;">What do their lives have to do with me?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana stood up and said in a cold voice, &quot;There are three large medical institutions in Capitole, one of which belongs to the Gellar family and the Marsh family. They all know you. Once you go for a paternity test, the people in these two families will realize it soon. Do you think you can get a real paternity test report?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter whether you believe it or not, because you and I have nothing to do with each other anymore. I don&#x27;t want a mother like you, because you chose your adopted daughter over your biological daughter, and you like raising a daughter for others. As long as you are happy, I will not prevent your tragic fate.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana finished speaking and felt relieved all over.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;After a while, your tragic fate will officially begin, not only for you, but also for your four sons and your parents.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula was shocked. Those beautiful eyes that were the same as Diana&#x27;s looked at Diana like a bottomless abyss.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Diana, how can you be so vicious? How can you be so cruel? How can you say such cruel words? I am your biological mother. How can you wish me a miserable fate?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana felt speechless when she heard Paula&#x27;s tearful words.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She sneered, &quot;So what if you&#x27;re my biological mother? When I was wronged, you always chose to believe Queenie. If you had ever had a bit of sincerity towards me, your biological daughter, I would not have easily broken up with you. But have you ever had that?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Actually, I can understand you. You raised Queenie since she was a baby, and you have a deep feeling for her. I can understand your deep love for her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I can also understand that you don&#x27;t have the slightest bit of affection for me, the daughter you got back when I was a teenager. You&#x27;re the one who didn&#x27;t want me. I did nothing to hurt you.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana felt very sad. What her mother, who she had once looked forward to the most, had given her was despair.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Now, she would have nothing to look forward to.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was enough for her to have her grandfather and three brothers.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula was trembling with anger. She could no longer suppress her anger and roared at Diana&#x27;s back, &quot;Diana, you pushed Madam Farley into the water. Cecil is looking for you. He will not let you go.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana turned to look at Paula. Her beautiful eyes were cold. &quot;I already know about this matter. Don&#x27;t worry. My affairs will not implicate you, the Marsh family, and Steven, that bastard.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She then smiled and turned to leave.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula looked at Diana&#x27;s back, her heart hurting. She thought, &quot;Is it really my fault?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie is the daughter I raised. Queenie is excellent and is my pride.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana has a vicious heart and has attacked Queenie many times. I said nothing about her. Instead, she said she didn&#x27;t want me as her mom.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Every time the evidence of her bullying Queenie is laid out in front of her, Diana denies it and says Queenie framed her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She really refuses to repent.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie has explained what happened at her birthday party. Why can&#x27;t Diana let it go?</p><p style="text-align:left;">She has framed Queenie many times. And Queenie only framed her once. Why can&#x27;t she be more sensible?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula was so angry that her heart hurt. She went out after Diana in anger. But when she reached the elevator, she saw two men in suits taking Diana away.</p><p>Paula saw her daughter being taken away. Even if she had no feelings for Diana, Diana was still her biological daughter.</p><p>She trotted over and saw Diana being taken into the elevator.</p><p>Paula was very anxious. Diana was her daughter. How could she not be worried?</p><p>&quot;Diana.&quot; Paula chased after them. But the elevator door had already closed.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="14.html">« Prev</a><a href="16.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
