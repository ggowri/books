Diana answered the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's me," Steven's deep voice echoed from the other end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was about to hang up upon hearing his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven seemed to sense she was about to end the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly interjected, "Diana, don't hang up. I need to tell you something."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was icy, "Go on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven pressed on, "He'll give you the land in the western suburbs in exchange for his son's freedom. I know you've had your eye on breaking into real estate with that land. That plot in the western suburbs is a rare find. You really ought to think about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana let out a laugh tinged with anger upon hearing this. "Steven, you're the one after that land in the western suburbs. Are you trying to sweet-talk me into handing it over to you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen up, it's not happening. I'm not releasing someone who's out to kill me. And about that land in the western suburbs? It's not for sale or development. Considering the geomantic features and the commanding hilltop location, this spot matches the description of where one might bury a revered general of old. Why would I buy it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven immediately grasped her insight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you know about the ancient tomb there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, "Thanks to you, I understand many things now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't ended her life once, triggering her rebirth, how would she have gained foresight into future events? The memory of him taking her life with his own hands was seared into her soul. He killed her and her unborn child. What could Steven and Queenie possibly offer her in recompense? She was determined to outlive them, to ensure they saw their end before she met hers again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana hung up furiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven still sought to use her at this juncture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remembered that in the times to come, Steven would buy the land in the western suburbs for an exorbitant sum. He would pour vast resources into its development, only to discover an ancient tomb beneath, triggering state intervention for its preservation, and resulting in losses exceeding a billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was entangled in this scheme, and Steven's company began its decline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life, her words weren't to warn Steven. She wouldn't alter his fate; he would follow the same path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, she felt something was amiss with Steven lately. His sudden reluctance to divorce was perplexing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was stubborn. Once he set his sights on something, he pursued it relentlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The western suburbs land was within his grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his office, Steven stared at the phone from which Diana had just disconnected. His handsome features were clouded with a somber expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Evan, who was seated opposite, and said, "I thought she was buying land for real estate, trying to offer advice. How did it sound like I was using her for the western suburbs land?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan smiled, "Mr. Gellar, it's because you've always catered to Queenie's demands, especially when it comes to things Ms. Bishop has. Whatever Queenie desires, you find ways to use Diana or take it from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's no wonder Ms. Bishop suspects you in this light."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned, realizing some actions were subconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remembered a time when Diana had a stunning bag that Queenie coveted. He had asked Diana to pass it to Queenie, rationalizing that Diana seldom left the house, whereas Queenie was by his side at social functions, making the bag more "useful" in her possession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes then held a look of disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Diana gave the bag to Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But her gaze grew colder each time she looked at Steven.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="503.html">« Prev</a><a href="505.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
