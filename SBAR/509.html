Racing, motorcycles, and diving were all her favorite sports.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just now, she suddenly thought of an idea to test Steven's attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It could also determine the following plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? The decision is in Cecil's hands?" Queenie was a little surprised. She thought, "Did Mr. Wyatt Farley lie to me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never tells the truth. He is really sly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Steven also wants the land in the western suburbs. It means it has great development value.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also wants to compete with Steven for that piece of land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If we take over it first, we can make a lot of money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie thought it was a good deal. She looked at Diana. "Diana, we are still good sisters. Please talk to Cecil about the land in the western suburbs. But I want to buy it at the lowest price."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at Steven, who was standing still.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven also looked at her deeply, with a hint of a smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't stop Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana raised her eyebrows slightly, feeling a little surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "What is Steven doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana then agreed, "Okay! I'll go find Cecil and ask him to sell it to you at the lowest price."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was a little confused as to why Diana didn't buy it. "Diana, everyone is scrambling for land in the western suburbs. I heard that you are also starting to do real estate. Why don't you buy it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, "I bought the land from Mr. Morrison for other purposes, not for real estate. Even if I had the money to buy the land in the western suburbs, I wouldn't have the money to develop it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm just an orphan. I don't have money to compete with you for the land. Mr. Wyatt Farley has spoken, so I just found out who owns the property rights of this piece of land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A friend of mine also wants to buy it. But I don't think he's as sincere as you. So I'm going to help you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was now in a hurry because that man urgently needed to come back to develop and seize the market. So, it didn't matter whether he bought it or not.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That piece of land couldn't be developed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the tomb was excavated, many survey teams would move in. There were antiques inside, which were of great research value.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was cautious, and it didn't matter whether she bought it or not.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Farley family was not short of money. By donating the land in the future, they would gain a good reputation, and the stock price of their company would rise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven didn't want it anymore. It meant he believed what Diana had said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glanced indifferently at Steven. He looked indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie thought for a moment and said, "Then I'll contact you later. I want to call my mother to discuss it first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled meaningfully, "Okay! I'll wait for your good news."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Diana left with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at her back and asked, "It's snowing heavily today. Where are you going?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned and looked at him. "Mr. Gellar, we are divorced. It is none of your business where I go. You should coax Queenie now. If it is late, you will not be able to please her without hundreds of thousands of dollars of jewelry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned. He thought, "If Queenie were unhappy before, I would buy her favorite jewelry to make her happy. But when I married Diana, I didn't even give her a wedding ring."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's heart was filled with guilt. "Come on. I'll take you somewhere."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked over to pull Diana. But Diana quickly took a step back and looked at him warily. "Steven, don't touched me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She dodged, feeling a stinging pain in her arm. She frowned slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven didn't dare to touch her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget it. You are injured. I will take you back to rest first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana refused him, saying, "Don't. I just want to go for a walk alone. Please do as you please."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She turned around and walked away quickly, thinking, "Let's see if the man behind Queenie would take the bait."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="508.html">« Prev</a><a href="510.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
