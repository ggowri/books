But it was just her info, no one else's."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven narrowed his eyes. "Could Diana be telling the truth?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why did Queenie suddenly show up tonight?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Has she actually been in </span><span>Capitole</span><span> all along?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said coldly, "Keep digging. We need to know for sure if she was alone or if someone was with her back then."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan couldn't understand why they were investigating that schemer Queenie, but he didn't dare ask.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Gellar. I'll keep at it and let you know the moment I find anything."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Good!" Steven hung up and gazed out the window. Everything outside had returned to normal, and Diana had long since vanished without a trace.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He smiled enigmatically. "Diana, you can't escape me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stood by the window, a solitary figure with a smug expression on his handsome face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, the image of the broken cup pieces she'd thrown in the trash flashed through his mind. He shuddered and headed downstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He fished the shards out of the garbage and carefully placed them in a bag.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rummaging through the cabinets, he came across the couple's dinnerware set and some herbs she'd meticulously prepared.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He jolted upright, taking in the emptiness of the villa. A growing unease gnawed at his chest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His thoughts drifted to his first encounter with Diana. She'd been a fireball of passion, her eyes brimming with determination.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The way she'd looked at him back then - her gaze had been full of light.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Diana was...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana arrived home by car.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She saw that Leopold and Tobias were still up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Walking over with a smile, she called out cheerfully, "Grandpa, Tobias, I'm back!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold let out a sigh of relief, seeing her return safely. "Diana, we were just discussing whether we should blast off on a rocket to rescue you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled involuntarily. "Grandpa, at your age, you might want to skip the rocket and stick to riding tortoises."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold was speechless. This cheeky girl. He'd been worried sick about her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That bastard Steven's methods were indeed brutal and vicious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he hadn't seen it with his own eyes, he wouldn't have been so concerned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In </span><span>Capitole</span><span>, few dared to cross Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias' face darkened. "Diana, what's gotten into Steven? Why'd he suddenly </span><span>drag</span><span> you back home?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sat beside Tobias, linking her arm through his as she said, "Tobias, he's craving my cooking. I'll go back to make him dinner and then return. In the future, don't worry when things like this happen. He might be a tough nut to crack, but I'm no pushover either. For the sake of keeping the peace, I won't burn bridges with him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking it over carefully, she realized Steven's cruelty towards her stemmed from Queenie's manipulations and his lack of love for her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An image flashed through her mind of Steven tenderly comforting Queenie in his arms, making her heart clench suddenly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She reconsidered, thinking to herself that a clever woman knew when to bend and when to stand firm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Until she became strong enough, she couldn't afford to butt heads with Steven directly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, she'd use her wit and smarts to get everything she wanted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana would snatch up all the resources Queenie had in her past life and make her own.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her previous life, she'd become helpless and alone for the sake of one man. Now, with a second chance, she could still feel the protection of her grandfather and three brothers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The feeling of being protected was truly blissful.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias furrowed his brow, and his expression was sullen. "Diana, if he dares to push you around again, can't the four of us siblings join forces against Steven?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't want Diana to suffer any more harm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled, playing with a lock of her hair as she said, "Tobias, there's no need for a fight to the death with him. We have other options that don't require exposing our identities. From what I know, there is another behind Queenie, and the person is particularly ambitious, always looking to swallow up all the prominent families. If we expose ourselves, we'll just become their target.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, what&rsquo;s our next move? " Tobias asked.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="80.html">« Prev</a><a href="82.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
