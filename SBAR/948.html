I don't know all the details, but I do know this. This year, we're going to have a peaceful Christmas. As for Queenie and her family... they won't be so lucky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just sit back and enjoy the show."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna noticed the teasing in her tone and decided to stop asking questions. Soon enough, she'd find out what the trap was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I still haven't been able to track down Evan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked genuinely worried, her mood visibly darkening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled softly, "Don't stress. He's fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna was still uneasy. "How can you be so sure? I've checked every nearby prison, but I haven't found any trace of him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana raised an eyebrow, her eyes sparkling with quiet confidence. She wasn't entirely sure, but women's intuition was rarely wrong. "Luna, trust a woman's sixth sense. He's fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna lowered her gaze, remaining silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana noticed her unusual behavior and couldn't help asking, "Luna, don't tell me... you and Evan have started to develop feelings for each other?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the mention of this, Luna's face turned bright red. She quickly shook her head, flustered. "No... it's not like that! We've been through a lot together. That's all. I don't want anything bad to happen to him. I've explained this to you before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn't help but laugh, seeing how embarrassed she was. "Luna, I think Evan is a great guy. He's loyal and would make a wonderful husband."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna froze, looking at Diana with wide eyes, clearly surprised by her serious tone. She spoke softly, "Diana, do you think he's a good person?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course! He's a solid guy. And if you end up with him, I'll be happy for both of you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're growing up, you know? You're at that age now when it's time to think about your future. I'm so grateful you've been by my side, but if you find your happiness, you need to go for it. You deserve it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was a good man, but he had lost his father when he was just starting college.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the years, he'd been working hard with Steven in the business world. Despite all the temptations, he'd stayed clean and focused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether in this life or the last, Diana had always known Evan to be someone she could trust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And when it came to Steven, Evan was the only one who was truly dedicated to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, if Mr. Gellar comes back... would you forgive him?" Luna asked, her curiosity obvious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled lightly, pulling out the divorce certificate from her drawer and waving it in front of Luna. "My time with him has run its course. We met at the wrong time, and it was never meant to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So don't worry about me. Be brave, and go after your happiness, Luna. Life is short. You have to live it the way you want to."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna wasn't happy about it because she wanted Diana to be happy, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I want you to be happy too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled warmly, "It's not that hard. I'll find someone who loves me even more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then handed her a list. "</span><span>Look</span><span> at tonight's guest list for Mr. Turner's banquet and make sure you're prepared."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Luna left, Diana sat down at her desk and began working.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the office across from her, Steven stared at his computer, his gaze locked on the divorce papers that Diana had brought with her. He couldn't help but wonder, "Is she really this happy after the divorce?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan stood nearby, wiping his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Luna so worried about him made him feel genuinely touched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quietly vowed to never let her down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven heard the sound of Evan sniffling and looked over, clearly confused. "What are you crying about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan sniffed again, wiping his nose. "Sir, I'm just so moved. Mrs. Gellar always believed I was a good man, and Luna was waiting for me. We need to speed up the plan, or she will forget about me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at him, speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, he asked, his tone low, "What's the update on Felicity?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan's expression turned cold. "Our people are still keeping an eye on her. Queenie's too smart for her good. She tampered with the contract when she signed it with the Foliot family. The assets were seized, but they've pinned the blame on the Foliot family. They look clean, but they've lost a lot, even if they're not guilty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's hand tightened on his knee, his gaze sharpening. "Make sure you hand the evidence to the police. If Felicity slips through this time, then let her spend Christmas behind bars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan's face lit up with excitement. They could finally take action. "Got it! I'll report her right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven gave a short nod, then looked back at Diana, who was deeply focused on her work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was when he got to see her at her best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't easy to find moments like these. But over the past few days, he'd been watching her manage everything with such efficiency. She was handling the company's affairs flawlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Felicity sent the inspection team away, she felt a wave of relief wash over her. Everything was finally resolved, and she could return home without worrying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stepped into the snow and dialed Queenie's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The phone picked up quickly, and Queenie's calm voice greeted her. "Ms. Marsh, the inspection team has left. Everything's been taken care of."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smiled, her tone reassuring. "Felicity, you've always done great work. I trust you. Once the company's affairs are settled, go home and take a break."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felicity smiled, her confidence growing. "Thank you, Ms. Marsh."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madam, are you Felicity Aniston?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was about to hang up, two police officers appeared in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felicity froze, her heart racing as she looked at them in disbelief. "Officers, is there a problem?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felicity," one of them said, "we've found evidence that you purchased illegal goods while you were in </span><span>Woodston</span><span>. The quantity is large enough to be considered a crime. We need you to come with us for questioning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Felicity's voice trembled. The incident in </span><span>Woodston</span><span> had happened months ago, how was it coming up now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her phone dropped from her hand, and Queenie, hearing the mention of </span><span>Woodston</span><span>, quickly hung up, alarmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation had been orchestrated for Cecil. Queenie had asked Felicity to buy illegal goods and stash them at Cecil's club, all to frame him. But in the end, Diana had intervened and saved him, and the whole thing had been quietly buried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had instructed Felicity to keep the amount within a controlled range to avoid suspicion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, though, Queenie couldn't help but wonder if Felicity had done something behind her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having just returned home, she stood up abruptly, her eyes burning with anger. Felicity was her most trusted ally. She couldn't afford to lose her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if the quantity of the illegal goods was large enough, even Queenie wouldn't be able to fix this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She walked over to the window, the view of the swirling snow outside matching the icy thoughts in her mind. This was one of her other residences, a simple apartment she preferred over a villa. She lived alone here, enjoying the solitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she stared out into the snow, her expression hardened, as cold and unyielding as the winter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, George came out of the bathroom and walked over to her. Noticing her tense mood, he wrapped his arms around her from behind and asked softly, "Queenie, what's wrong?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="947.html">« Prev</a><a href="949.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
