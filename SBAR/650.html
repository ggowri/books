You have a woman you like, so what's there to be shy about? Everyone knows you adore Queenie and treat her like a precious gem. It's clear for all to see.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you still hiding it?" Cecil's words were dripping with sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven shot him a cold glare, signaling him to shut up.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he glanced over at Diana, who was smiling even more brightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His anger only deepened. For the first time, he was beginning to understand the pain Diana must have felt when he had abandoned her to be ambiguously involved with Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie looked to Steven, pleading silently. If she was thrown out in front of everyone, her reputation would be utterly ruined. Lily was clearly doing this on purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She directed her imploring gaze at Steven, her eyes filled with desperation. "Steven, that was something my mother did. It has nothing to do with me. Please, I beg you," she said in a barely audible voice. It had been a long time since she had pleaded with anyone like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hopeful eyes met Steven's, but there was no emotion on his handsome face.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or rather, his eyes had become completely unfamiliar to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven turned towards Queenie. "Ms. Marsh, your mother made a mistake, so you should take her home and reflect on it properly. Staying here won't do any good, as Mrs. Foliot doesn't like you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought to herself, "Has he become this indifferent with his answers now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's lips curled into a slight smirk. "Mr. Jeff Marsh, why aren't you taking them away already?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff had long since lost face. He didn't want to stay here anymore and never wanted to show up at such gatherings again.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a man who valued his pride, but that pride couldn't withstand the blows to his dignity. He was miserably poor.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Paula, he would have spent his entire life muddling through, living from paycheck to paycheck.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, looking back, what had he turned his life into?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Paula, he was nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cast a cold glance at Queenie and her mother. "Are you not leaving yet? Do you want to keep embarrassing yourselves? If you want to stay, stay on your own."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing his words, Jeff strode away; he didn't want to be thrown out by Lily's bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie took one last deep, aggrieved look at Steven before turning and leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie followed quickly after.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was taken aback, glancing at Steven. He hadn't stood up for Queenie. She found it a little hard to believe.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, in the past, no matter what Queenie did, Steven had always been endlessly indulgent.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Steven met her questioning gaze, he felt puzzled. He thought, "What is she trying to say with that look?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily chuckled and spoke loudly, "I'm sorry for letting everyone witness such an embarrassing incident today. I know this was disgraceful, but this is just how I do things. My husband betrayed me, secretly plotting for a divorce and attempting to transfer our assets. For the sake of my safety, I had no choice but to expose this matter. It's not easy for someone to reveal their pain and humiliation to the public, but I had no other choice. I ask for everyone's understanding."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily spoke calmly, a smile on her face as she addressed the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Paula understood the pain and hatred she harbored within.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had both endured the same betrayal and humiliation from the same woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene today was something Paula had envisioned countless times in her mind. She was somewhat satisfied with how it played out.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But realizing that she had lived her whole life in deceit and seeing that woman's hideous face revealed to the public didn't bring her any sense of relief or satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All she felt was a surge of pain flooding her chest like a relentless tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only after losing everything that she finally woke up, but the price was far too great.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since discovering the truth, her heart had been in agony every night.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But letting go of the past wasn't an easy task.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people approached Lily, taking advantage of the spectacle to advise her to let things go.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily laughed it off, saying it was fine, and then invited everyone to have dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Paula looked sharply towards Diana, who was standing next to Cecil, and walked over to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cautiously asked, "Diana, can we talk?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="649.html">« Prev</a><a href="651.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
