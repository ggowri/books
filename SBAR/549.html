She volunteered to wash the dishes in the kitchen while Althea, feeling a bit sore, paced around the living room to ease the tension in her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every so often, her baby would give a little kick, bringing a smile to Althea's face. "Such a little lazy cat," she thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it was exhausting to go through a winter pregnancy, Althea was filled with anticipation and excitement to meet her child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would give her baby the best love she could offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hospital was right across the street, and with its excellent facilities, she felt secure in her decision to give birth there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned and looked at Althea, saying, "Althea, if you're not feeling well, just go lie down. By the look of things, your baby could come any time tonight or by tomorrow morning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea chuckled. "Alright, Diana! My back is aching. I'll go rest a bit. Help yourself to anything you'd like."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana replied, "No worries! I'll make myself at home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a contented smile, Althea went off to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana finished up the dishes, dried her hands, and noticed her phone vibrating. Seeing an unfamiliar number, she frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be Steven again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come outside. I have something to say to you." Steven's deep, raspy voice sounded as commanding as ever, leaving no room for argument.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana arched an eyebrow. Was this man half-asleep in the middle of the day?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was as demanding as always.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wry smile, Diana replied, "Where to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's voice remained gruff. "The restaurant next to my office. I'll be waiting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana responded, "Alright! I'll be right over," and hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face lit up with a mischievous grin. Let him wait and experience what it was like for her during those countless times she had waited for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She packed a small suitcase, took one last look at the stopped snowfall, and gazed at the distant, stormy ocean waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a scene that filled her with a sense of awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dressed in comfortable clothing, she grabbed her tablet and attended to a few emails from Nolan before settling in to watch a series.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Steven had already arrived at the restaurant and waited nearly an hour for her, but there was still no sign of Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't one to wait on people, and the act of waiting grated on his nerves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He checked his watch&mdash;an hour and twenty minutes had passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reminded himself of the evenings when she had often waited for him, and resolved to be patient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, by the time the server came around for a second time, asking if he wanted to order, he checked the time again&mdash;it had already been two hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had an important meeting coming up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling pressed, he decided to call Diana again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was immersed in an episode of her show, an easy-going romance. In fact, she knew that the film and television industry would be impacted by short videos in two years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had already started making plans to venture into the short video market once the development project in Luspus kicked off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mind was spinning with ideas when her phone abruptly rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recognizing Steven's number, she remembered she had left him waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Setting down her tablet, she answered the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, why aren't you here yet?" Steven's voice was now tinged with frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn't help but smile as she delivered the cold truth. "Steven, with all this heavy snow, I took one step outside and decided I wasn't about to freeze for this. I thought you'd be gone already&mdash;it's unlike you to wait."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked out at the misty sky. A deep haze seemed to settle over everything, casting a subtle gloom. In the end, people always made time for what they truly cared about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every choice reveals a person's priorities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven took a deep breath, holding back his irritation. "Diana, you did that on purpose, didn't you?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="548.html">« Prev</a><a href="550.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
