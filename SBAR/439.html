She's stressed over the company, while you're here partying and made bets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You and your three brothers and your lovely little sister, aside from partying, do you ever think about how hard your mother works?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric was momentarily speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Recently, he had been living it up, participating in motorcycle races abroad, neglecting domestic matters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For years, their father let them run wild, free to do as they pleased, knowing there was plenty of family money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly cut off from his allowance, he couldn't even muster a million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He usually drained his account monthly, and with a new girlfriend, he had even less saved up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He sneered. "Diana, the Marsh family doesn't need your interference. Just save me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana found his immaturity laughable, especially at her age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ironically, she found it absurd that she'd lost her life for such shallow familial bonds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Eric, you just said the Marsh family doesn't need me. So why do you think I would save you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, don't be so malicious," Eric noticed her seriousness and felt a chill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh! Not saving you is malicious? But you didn't think it was malicious when you hit me, or when you bullied me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When you wanted to hand me over to those guys, didn't you think that was malicious?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tonight, I'm recording everything. After the race, I'll give it to the police. You think I'd let this go?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Smack! Diana slapped him, taunting. "Useless, can't you just shut your mouth? It's noisy. Save your righteous talk for the police."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And for the last two years, however you and Queenie bullied me, I'll return the favor."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric was shocked. "I'm your brother. How dare you treat me this way?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana had truly changed. He could see she clung to the Marsh family's affection, enduring their relentless bullying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They only valued Queenie. Diana would never be regarded as worthy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you really think you deserve to be my brother? I, Diana Bishop, will have nothing to do with the Marsh family ever again. I'll watch you all get dragged to hell by your own demons."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana turned to Elroy, her tone icy. "Mr. Morrison, if you're ready, let's start."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elroy noticed she was serious and chuckled. "How do you want to compete?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana pointed to the most difficult race track in the distance. "I want to race on the hardest track. Whoever reaches the finish line first wins."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric shouted, "Diana, do you even know how to race? You want to take on the hardest track? Are you insane?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Furious, Diana turned, her cold gaze fixed on him. "Shut your annoying mouth."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You..." Eric was furious, stamping his foot. How dare she insult him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elroy laughed arrogantly, full of swagger. "Alright! Miss Bishop, choose your car. If you win, that land is yours. If you lose, you'll be my underground lover for a year."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana nodded. "Deal!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She pointed at a red sports car. "I'll take that one."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elroy smirked, "Don't you know that's the lowest model in the race?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana didn't respond, simply flashing a bright smile as she walked toward the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Someone whistled, eagerly awaiting the show.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What a pretty girl! If she crashes, what a shame that would be."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric's face darkened. "She's so malicious. Better off dead!"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="438.html">« Prev</a><a href="440.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
