Evan was unwilling to do that. He had never seen a stock price rise to such a spectacular level.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overnight, Steven accumulated almost the wealth of three lifetimes of the four great families. He was so capable.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The price had clearly hit the bottom before, but suddenly it went up again. Evan later invested in 10 million and made a lot of money. He was reluctant to sell them.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How many times will the stock price increase by tomorrow morning?" he wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sell them immediately," Steven warned Evan.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan also knew that the stock market was volatile, so he didn't get greedy and sold the stocks immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Steven hung up the phone, he saw Diana coming out of the kitchen with pancakes. "Steven, we'll have pancakes for breakfast."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven put his phone on the table and went over to help her. He said calmly, "I like pancakes, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She made them early in the morning, and they looked so good.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Diana heard what Steven said and saw the faint smile on his handsome face, she felt that he had changed and become a little strange.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it didn't stop her from hating him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help yourself." Diana put the pancakes on the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana liked food to be hot. She sat opposite Steven. Seeing that he was eating seriously, she said, "Mr. Gellar, I'll be away for three days. I've prepared you oatmeal, bread, and some vegetables. You can cook them yourself. They're all easy to make."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at her with a frown and asked, "Where are you going?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her absence for three days was so sudden that he was not used to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana explained, "I'm going to see a friend."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven thought of the call she received in the morning. It was from Althea.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So she'll go see Althea?" Steven wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded calmly. "Okay! Remember to come back in three days."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't say anything and just thought, "Is he really afraid that I'll run away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven just looked at her without saying anything, as if waiting for her to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled and said, "Mmm. I'll be back in three days. You don't have to worry about me running away."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was afraid that she would run away, but in fact, she only humored him out of consideration for his grandma and grandpa's feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobias was competent. He may not be able to handle the pressure Steven put on him temporarily, but he would definitely be able to take care of it later.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobias was doing better than Steven in foreign markets.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this time, Steven did it on purpose because he didn't want Diana to leave him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lowered his head to eat pancakes, and after finishing his food, he gave Diana a black card.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at him with surprise. "Why are you giving it to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven replied, "It's for your living expenses."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana frowned slightly. Steven had a realization, but she didn't need it. Perhaps as his wife, she could take it with a clear conscience, but she didn't need it. "No, I can afford my living expenses. If I take it, I'm afraid Queenie will cause you trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what if I'm the legal wife? Steven has always favored Queenie," Diana thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned and looked at her. "Why mention her? It has nothing to do with her."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't think so. Queenie asked you earlier why you bought so many clothes for me, a housewife who doesn't need decent clothes. Have you ever bought a dress for me, your nominal wife, since then?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everything about her is good. You might as well please her with the money."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="756.html">« Prev</a><a href="758.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
