I'll talk to him. Don't worry about me. I'll come back to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wanted to talk about divorce.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander turned and looked at her, saying, "Diana, I'll be waiting for you in the car."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Alexander strode away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven reached out to pull Diana, but Diana swiftly dodged him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was left standing there, his hands empty. "Come back with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana questioned, "Steven, what are you playing? You're the one who asked me to leave."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I thought you were just messing around. It's been over six months. Enough is enough. Come back with me," Steven insisted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana found his reasoning absurd. She gazed at him; under the light, his face gleamed, exuding breathtaking handsomeness. Any woman would be drawn to him, yet Diana now found him repulsive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She retorted, "Why do you always think I'm just messing around? You were the one fooling around with Queenie every day. I messed around because I wanted you to come home and take medicine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've done everything to bring you back. But what have you done? Nothing. Why should I leave and return whenever you please?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven, mark my words. I will never be with you again. I would rather die than be with a jerk like you," Diana declared firmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was taken aback by the intensity of her words. He realized he had been wrong and deceived by Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He never truly loved Diana, so he never bothered to consider her feelings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But over the two years of marriage, she had become an integral part of his life, a good wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Queenie's return brought out Diana's jealousy and confrontational nature, testing his patience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he reflected on his actions, Steven recognized his own foolishness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A dangerous glint flashed in his eyes as he spoke in a low voice, "You would rather die than be with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana had been tired of dealing with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," she affirmed, her tone unwavering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven focused on her, his expression unreadable. "That is not what I want. Once I settle my affairs, I will bring you back. Until then, you must maintain distance from other men, especially Alexander. His force is overseas, but mine can easily outmatch his."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was stunned. She recalled Steven's formidable overseas force that he had established at 18 years old, overshadowing Alexander's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you threatening me?" she asked, her face turning red with anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven smirked, finding her fiery look somewhat endearing. "Diana, in this world, as long as I want, no one can escape my grasp, including you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Except for when necessary for collaboration, avoid contact with him, and remember that your grandfather and Tobias are your weaknesses."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His smile held a wicked edge, and Diana couldn't decipher the emotions in his narrowed eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana glared at him. She had been careless, revealing Tobias and Leopold in his presence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Leopold and her three brothers were extremely private people and rarely seen in public.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Could Steven really find out the whereabouts of my brothers?" she wondered.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="277.html">« Prev</a><a href="279.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
