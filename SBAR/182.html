She hadn't anticipated they would resort to such a trick. The drug had left her limbs weak and limp. There was no way she could run now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Cecil, can't you even stand? What makes you think I can escape?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil gave her a wry smile. "Diana, it looks like we're going to heaven together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was speechless. She had no desire to accompany him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She wasn't ready to die.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Cecil, death is excruciatingly painful. You've died a gruesome death before, with your limbs chopped off," Diana said sympathetically, looking at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil felt a chill run through him. He had the unsettling feeling that she was telling the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing Diana's reluctance, Cecil's gaze was a mix of melancholy and mischief, "Diana, are you not willing to be with me? My handsome face is one of a kind in this world, you know."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana glanced at him. "I'm afraid I prefer to live."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She hadn't avenged herself yet. She couldn't just leave like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil chuckled, exuding a wild and sexy aura.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Stop laughing! You're both on the brink of death, and you still have the mood to chat? You there, drag them away. Use the back door and head straight to the back mountain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"As for the woman, the employer wants us to 'entertain' her properly. Find a few strong men for her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil twitched his mouth. These men were so crass, ruining his debonair charm. He put away his usual nonchalance and gave them a cold glance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana's eyes were filled with a chilling frost. It was the same old tactic, but it was one of the cruelest methods against women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They were dragged away in a disheveled state.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Yet, Cecil wasn't panicked, a casual smile appearing on his charmingly handsome face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He looked at the silent Diana. "Diana, will we find true feelings through our shared tribulations?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana exhaled in annoyance. "You don't have to be so romantic."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But aren't we being quite romantic right now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Get inside. Romantic? Go be romantic in heaven."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The men rudely pushed Cecil into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil, lacking strength, awkwardly lay sprawled on the seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana, also feeling weak all over, was thrown directly onto Cecil.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil caught the faint fragrance from her, his gaze becoming increasingly deep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He looked intently at Diana's stunningly beautiful face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She looked at the man who had pushed her down with disgust, her eyes filled with fierceness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, those men got into the minivan, not caring about the positions Diana and Cecil were in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The two, lacking strength, maintained their previous postures.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was half-lying in Cecil's arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil's hand weakly rested on her waist, supporting her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The faint fragrance from her stirred emotions in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The minivan left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna was about to follow by car when the door was suddenly opened. Steven and Evan quickly got in as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven looked at Luna. "Drive."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna responded coldly, "Get out. The last person Ms. Bishop wants to see is you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan tried to explain, but Steven spoke first, "Drive. Follow them immediately."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His tone was forceful, his voice edged with coldness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna didn't waste any more time with him and started the car to follow the minivan in front.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had just rushed to the branch company and quickly drove this car over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna was an excellent driver, always following closely behind the car Diana was in without being too obvious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She also called the police and sent them the location.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan looked at Luna, who was driving. She was thin and beautiful yet very cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He thought, "How much courage would it take to warm up such a chilly girl?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="181.html">« Prev</a><a href="183.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
