Hearing her faint complaint, he quickly sat up and reached out to feel her forehead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her forehead was burning hot. He murmured softly, "Diana, you're sick. We need to get you to the hospital right away."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt miserable. She shook her head weakly and whispered, "Take me home. I have medicine and needles there. I can give myself a shot. The hospital's too uncomfortable."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn</span><span>'</span><span>t hate hospitals, but it was just a minor cold. She didn</span><span>'</span><span>t see the need to go.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "Alright! Let's go home."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven quickly got out of bed, slipped on his shoes, then helped her with hers. Scooping her up in his arms, he carried her home.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the car.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was drowsy, her eyes shut tight. The fever left her feeling miserable. Occasionally, she pressed her dry, chapped lips together in discomfort.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven drove fast, weaving through traffic to get home as quickly as possible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By the time they got home, Diana had fallen into a deep sleep.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the way, Steven had already instructed Evan to arrange for a doctor to come and give Diana an IV.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In all their years together, this was the first time Steven had seen Diana seriously ill. She was always healthy, and even a minor cold would pass with just a bit of medicine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this time, she was seriously ill.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the IV, the doctor examined Diana thoroughly and found no other issues. It was just a cold and fever; she'd be fine after the treatment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stayed by Diana's side the entire time. It took four IV bottles before her fever finally broke.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She woke up, her forehead damp with sweat. Her hair clung to her skin, and Steven had never seen Diana look so fragile before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He held her hand tightly, his heart aching. "Diana, are you feeling uncomfortable anywhere else? The doctor's downstairs. I can call them up right now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana blinked, her voice hoarse. "No need. My whole body feels awful. Steven, I'm sick. I can</span><span>'</span><span>t even remember the last time I needed an IV&mdash;it</span><span>'</span><span>s been years."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's throat felt sore, and her lips were dry. Steven gently used a cotton swab to moisten her lips, easing her discomfort.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana slowly sat up. This time, she truly felt miserable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven placed a pillow behind her, making sure she could lean back more comfortably.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven gently brushed his hand across her forehead. Her fever had finally subsided.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, her face was pale and cold to the touch.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the illness, she looked even thinner.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, are you hungry?" Steven asked softly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nodded. "Yes, I'm hungry. I want something delicious."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled. "Alright, I'll have Luna prepare something for you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven picked up his phone and texted Luna, asking her to whip up something delicious and bring it up for Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna had everything ready&mdash;steak, salad, and Steven's favorite mushroom soup.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had been by Diana's side all evening and skipped dinner himself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana no longer felt dizzy and could walk on her own. She decided to freshen up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She took a deep breath, instantly feeling much lighter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at Steven. "Go have dinner first. I'll join you in a bit."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven noticed her awkwardness and quietly left the bathroom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana let out a sigh of relief. Steven was starting to feel a bit clingy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She closed the bathroom door and took a quick, hot shower.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Half an hour later, she dried her hair and finally felt completely refreshed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling weak, she dragged herself to get something to eat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t eating; he was waiting for her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sat on the couch, dressed in pristine white loungewear, exuding an air of elegance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His skin was flawless, his features strikingly refined. He looked just like she remembered!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sighed. Seeing Steven in white, it was impossible not to steal glances at him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was just so irresistibly handsome.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sat down beside him, openly letting her gaze roam over Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven felt a bit embarrassed under her stare, but he didn</span><span>'</span><span>t look away. Instead, he gazed at her intently. </span><span>"</span><span>Diana, what are you looking at? Is there something on my face?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had just been to the bathroom. He only came out after washing his face. Could there really be something on his face?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven reached up and touched his face, but felt nothing there.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching his reaction, Diana flashed a sly smile. </span><span>"</span><span>You</span><span>'</span><span>re really handsome. Have I ever told you what I thought the first time I saw you?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Diana</span><span>'</span><span>s mind, she replayed that picturesque moment from years ago. Every time she thought of it, a smile would unknowingly grace her lips.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven remembered that smile. It was gentle, warm, and radiant. Back then, the subtle melancholy in his eyes had transformed into deep affection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t forgotten how she once said she loved seeing him in a white shirt.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said softly, "Diana, I remember."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled, her voice slightly husky. To Steven, her laughter was enchanting, full of life and allure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven pulled her into his arms, holding her tightly with heartfelt emotion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He lowered his head and kissed the top of her hair. "Diana, I've admired you for so long," he said tenderly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana snapped back to her senses, quickly averting her gaze. He was just too handsome.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once again, she found herself irresistibly drawn to Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stepped out of his embrace, her cheeks flushed. She pointed to the dishes on the table. "Let's eat."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching her avoid him, Steven felt a twinge of disappointment, but not for long. As long as he tried, he knew he could win her back again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His Diana was pure and kind-hearted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven handed her a glass of warm water. "Diana, drink this first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's throat was already parched. She took the glass, tilted her head back, and drank half of it in one go.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven took the glass from her and slipped on a pair of disposable gloves. Then, he tore the chicken into small pieces and fed them to Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The roasted chicken was tender and flavorful. Diana ate happily, savoring every bite.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is delicious, so tender. Luna's cooking just keeps getting better."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was starving. After she finished a drumstick, Steven stopped her from eating more. He set his phone aside on the other end.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at him, puzzled. "I'm not full yet."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven knew she wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t full. He picked up the bowl of porridge and fed her. </span><span>"</span><span>You</span><span>'</span><span>re sick, you can</span><span>'</span><span>t eat too much. Have some oatmeal porridge instead.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana blinked but kept her mouth shut. She still wanted more roasted chicken.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just one more chicken wing, and I promise I</span><span>'</span><span>ll stop. Then I</span><span>'</span><span>ll drink the oatmeal porridge like a good girl."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the hopeful look in her eyes, Steven couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t bring himself to say no.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, he tore off another chicken wing and fed it to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After finishing another chicken wing, Diana felt nearly full. A few sips of oatmeal porridge later, she finally regained some strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only then did Steven calmly start eating his dinner.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana watched him and smiled. "Steven, after all these years of knowing you, this is the first time you've ever taken care of me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven replied, "It was always you taking care of me before."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana pointed at him. "Just eat your dinner already."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's emotions were a tangled mess. Once you bow your head and forgive, do you forever lose your dignity? Was she doing the right thing?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven finished his meal. Noticing Diana lost in thought, he texted Luna, asking her to come upstairs and clear the table.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna came upstairs, said nothing, and quickly cleared the table before leaving.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was still lost in thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven sat down beside her. Gently tucking a strand of hair behind her ear, he asked softly, "Diana, what's on your mind?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1127.html">« Prev</a><a href="1129.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
