The cigarette in his hand dropped onto the blanket. Instantly, faint wisps of smoke rose from where the cigarette had burned.</p><p>Owen quickly snuffed it out, worried it might cause a fire.</p><p>He looked up again and saw a middle-aged man walking in with a group of reporters.</p><p>The woman lying beside him woke up. When she saw them, she clung to Owen in terror.</p><p>That middle-aged man was her husband.</p><p>Owen was stunned too. He coldly stared at the group who barged in and said, &quot;What are you doing? Are the hotel staff asleep or what? How dare you break into my room like this? Get out.&quot;</p><p>But his icy tone didn&#x27;t faze anyone. The reporters were busy snapping pictures.</p><p>Owen froze, an ominous feeling creeping over him.</p><p>The middle-aged man in front of him roared angrily, &quot;Owen, how dare you slept with my wife? You got a death wish?&quot;</p><p>Click. He was Roger Simpson, his father&#x27;s friend.</p><p>&quot;You&#x27;re saying this woman is your wife? How is that possible?&quot; He stared at Roger in shock.</p><p>&quot;That&#x27;s right, she is my wife. Jocelyn, you shameless woman. In bed with my friend&#x27;s son? You&#x27;re truly despicable.&quot;</p><p>Jocelyn was stunned. She looked at Owen, crying while pounding his chest.</p><p>Between sobs, she said, &quot;Roger, I don&#x27;t know what happened. Last night I went to the bar to find you, but I didn&#x27;t see you. This man came over and offered me a drink. I was a bit upset, so I didn&#x27;t refuse.</p><p>&quot;But after drinking, I don&#x27;t remember anything. I don&#x27;t even know how I ended up here. Call the police. He raped me.&quot;</p><p>Jocelyn kept crying. She looked at Owen in terror, her eyes filled with hatred.</p><p>Owen stared back in shock. &quot;You&#x27;re talking nonsense. Last night, you came to the hotel with me willingly. How dare you say I that? </p><p>&quot;Don&#x27;t you dare try to twist this. There are cameras everywhere. We&#x27;ll check the footage, and it&#x27;ll show whether you came here willingly or if I forced you. Now get up! What do you think you&#x27;re doing?&quot;</p><p>If it turned out he forced Jocelyn to come here, the consequences would be even more severe.</p><p>He would be labeled a rapist. Last night, he&#x27;d been talking business with a partner, who kept pouring him drinks. To seal the deal, he drank them all.</p><p>Later, Owen got a bit drunk. Suddenly, a woman came over to support him. The two of them entered the hotel together, and one thing led to another.</p><p>He had been in these situations before but had never gotten played like this. </p><p><em>How dare a woman do this to me?</em></p><p>Roger shouted angrily, &quot;Owen, your father and I are good friends. Jocelyn and I&#x27;ve only been married for two months, and you raped her. How dare you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;She&#x27;s your elder, and you forced her? You&#x27;re out of your mind. Kidnapped her and raped her? Do you know what that means?&quot;</p><p>Owen certainly knew what this meant. He just didn&#x27;t expect them to frame him.</p><p>During this time, he had been guarding against Queenie, but it turned out he&#x27;d been set up by them.</p><p>&quot;Roger, call the police. He raped me. I don&#x27;t want to live anymore. How could he do this to me? We were so in love. How could he drug me?&quot; Jocelyn cried out in pain.</p><p>Owen&#x27;s face turned pale. Even a dummy could see the setup now.</p><p>Ever since Steven and Queenie got together, he always felt a pair of eyes watching him from the shadows.</p><p>Owen shouted, &quot;Get out! All of you, get out! If anyone dares to talk about what happened today, I&#x27;ll send them a lawyer&#x27;s letter.&quot;</p><p>A reporter kindly reminded him, &quot;Mr. Toby, this is a live broadcast. Everyone in the stream saw you in bed with your father&#x27;s friend&#x27;s wife. The chat is exploding. How could you do such a thing? </p><p>&quot;I heard you graduated from an overseas economics university, come from a wealthy family, and are very talented. How could you have such a vice?&quot;</p><p>Owen stared at him coldly. &quot;This is just the woman&#x27;s side of story, yet you&#x27;re feeding into it. Are you in on this together?&quot;</p><p>The reporter sneered and said, &quot;Mr. Toby, you misunderstood. We&#x27;re not in on this together. We&#x27;re just stationed reporters here.&quot;</p><p>The live chat was filled with comments.</p><p>[Owen has such an impressive background, but look at what he&#x27;s done. Disgusting.]</p><p>[It&#x27;s not surprising. Talent and morals don&#x27;t always go hand in hand. Does he think his education means he can do whatever he wants?]</p><p>[I used to think Owen was a great young entrepreneur, but now I see he&#x27;s a madman.]</p><p>[All his so-called success is just a facade. The way he treated women shows his true character.]</p><p>[He&#x27;s a moral disgrace. No amount of talent can hide that filthy soul.]</p><p>[Doesn&#x27;t anyone think that woman is so pretentious? Who drinks random drinks at bars?]</p><p>Luna was eating while keeping an eye on things online. Seeing Owen caught red-handed, she felt great.</p><p>She smiled and said, &quot;Great! Owen always picks on Diana. Now, he&#x27;s finally getting what he deserves.&quot;</p><p>Evan asked, &quot;Luna, what&#x27;s wrong?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Owen&#x27;s in trouble. Check your phone. I&#x27;m going to show Diana this live stream.&quot; </p><p>With that, Luna quickly went to find Diana.</p><p>Diana was relaxing on the sofa, watching a drama.</p><p>Steven was sitting beside her, but there&#x27;s not much interaction between them.</p><p>Seeing Luna rush in, Diana&#x27;s mood instantly soured. </p><p><em>Did something happen at the company again?</em></p><p>Diana sighed. &quot;Luna, what happened?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Diana, you have to see this. Owen slept with his dad&#x27;s friend&#x27;s wife, and they caught him in the act.&quot;</p><p>Diana and Nolan both thought Owen was a jerk. Neither of them liked him much. After all, Owen always looked at them with disdain.</p><p>Diana really hated Owen and Yanson. They were both talkative and arrogant. </p><p>Diana rarely went out these days because of her leg, but when she did, it felt like everyone wanted to kill her.</p><p>Looking at the live stream on her phone, Diana shook her head and said, &quot;He can&#x27;t control himself. He&#x27;ll get caught sooner or later. Totally deserves it.&quot;</p><p>Diana handed the phone back to Luna. </p><p>Looking at Luna&#x27;s smug face, she whispered, &quot;Luna, as much as you&#x27;re enjoying this, be a little more discreet. After all, he&#x27;s Mr. Gellar&#x27;s good friend. Don&#x27;t go overboard.&quot;</p><p>Luna snorted coldly and said, &quot;They&#x27;re the same.&quot;</p><p>Steven was speechless.</p><p><em>I&#x27;m not like Owen. I&#x27;ve never done such things. And I&#x27;d never let anyone find out my weaknesses. If I did, I&#x27;d be dead by now.</em></p><p>Looking at Diana, Steven said, &quot;Diana, Owen was probably framed.&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="1062.html">« Prev</a><a href="1064.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
