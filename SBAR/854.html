Why didn't Luna answer the call all of a sudden?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven put Paige on a sofa in the lobby, where the heating was the most sufficient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana squatted down and continued to rub Paige's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at Steven, who was standing aside, and said, "What are you standing there for? Come over here and rub Paige's hands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Men shouldn't touch women."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana laughed angrily, "She's dying. Why should you be so particular when it comes to a person's life? Hurry up and rub her other hand. Don't let her hands get frostbitten."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven raised his eyebrows and watched her trying hard to rub Paige's hands. He also squatted down, picked up Paige's hand, and followed suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked outside, wondering why the ambulance hadn't arrived yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige's hands were colder than he had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was very anxious. Seeing the hotel manager coming over, she quickly said, "Hello, my friend fainted from the freeze. Could you please ask two waitresses to come over and rub my friend's feet and turn up the heating slightly? The ambulance will be here soon. Thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." The manager recognized Steven and quickly pivoted around to make arrangements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, three more waitresses joined Diana and Steven and were responsible for rubbing Paige's feet. After a while, Paige's face showed a hint of color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't dare let Paige stay here for too long. She kept glancing out the window, and finally, the sound of an ambulance was heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She breathed a sigh of relief and gazed at Steven. "Mr. Gellar, please help me again and carry Paige to the ambulance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the distant form of address, he stared at her coldly. If Paige hadn't needed his help, Diana would never have allowed him to stay here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In silence, he carried Paige on his back and whispered, "Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thanking the waitresses, Diana followed him out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they got in the ambulance, she fixed her eyes on Steven and said, "Mr. Gellar, thank you for your help tonight. You can go back now. I need to send Paige to the hospital for treatment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned and met her strange, chilly eyes, and his gaze gradually turned icy. "Diana, after using me, are you going to kick me out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's brows furrowed. "When did I use you? In your eyes, is asking you for a favor taking advantage of you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if it had been someone else, they would have offered a hand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suspected that Queenie was responsible for Paige's kidnapping.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, she assumed that Steven appeared to delay her and prevent her from ruining Queenie's moment of glory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go to the hospital with you," he insisted in a cold voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was very irritable and cold at that moment. Suppressing her anger, she glared at him. "Steven, you don't have to worry about me ruining Queenie's highlight moment. If she wants to win, I will let her have it. There is no need for you to hold me back for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, it is your business to give the designs to Queenie. They are yours. So, there is no need to hurt my friend by doing such a shameless thing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven finally understood what Diana meant. He looked at Diana in disbelief and said in an unusually hoarse voice, "Do you think I schemed against Paige to stop you from destroying Queenie's interview?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="853.html">« Prev</a><a href="855.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
