However, it's not the right time yet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had no evidence. If they sent Queenie to the police station, she would be out soon. It</span><span>'</span><span>s useless. So, they had to wait.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Diken Toby, let's wait a bit longer. Our current evidence isn't enough to bring her to justice." Diana didn't say much more because the more they knew, the faster they would die.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Besides, Yanson wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t listen to advice.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Diken Toby." Yanson hurried over anxiously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How's Owen? Do we have any way to get him out?" Yanson asked anxiously. He thought, "Queenie said she already sent the evidence to the police."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diken's face looked terrible. "Yanson, Owen is fine now. We've found the evidence. He'll be released soon."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Yanson breathed a sigh of relief and then smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment he saw Diana, he became serious again. "Diana, why are you here, you country bumpkin? Why are you everywhere?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling Nick's piercing gaze sweep over, Yanson shrank his neck in fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hadn't forgotten how hard Nick could hit when he fought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Last time, after being hit in the face by Nick, Yanson was in a lot of pain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana frowned and said, "I didn't greet you, so there's no need for you to greet me, a country bumpkin. When I come here or run into you elsewhere, please pretend you don't know me. You don't want to talk to me. Do I look like I want to talk to you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "He's really sick!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana found Yanson more annoying than Owen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She could save Owen because he was somewhat useful. But Yanson was completely useless and only threw tantrums.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yanson was furious, but since Diken was here, he didn't dare say much.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Is Diana looking down on me? Who does she think she is? How dare she look down on me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A few minutes later, Owen came out in a sorry state.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment he saw Diana, he sprinted toward her. "Diana, thank you. Thank you for saving me. I knew you would save me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen's eyes were moist. He was truly grateful that Diana saved him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yanson was stunned and said, "Owen, who are you thanking? Do you know that Queenie went to investigate the truth for you? She didn't even have time for breakfast. Also, it was after she handed the truth she found to the police that you were released. Why are you thanking this bumpkin?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was shocked and thought, "Queenie helped Owen? How come I didn't know? The one who delivered the evidence to the police and got Owen out was Luna. Queenie is so shameless, stealing someone else's credit."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen looked at him coldly, "Yanson, you said Queenie saved me? Did you see her hand the evidence to the police with your own eyes?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yanson shook his head. "No. But I called her when I was on my way. She said she would hand the evidence to the police and get you out, and that she didn't even have time for breakfast while gathering evidence for you. Also, she said she had already sent someone to deliver the evidence, so I came to pick you up."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was stunned, a bit surprised, and thought, "I really didn't expect Queenie to steal someone else's credit like this. She's busy fighting for the branch company, how could she have time to help Owen gather evidence?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen sneered, "Yanson, do you believe everything she says?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Would Queenie lie to us? You don't think Diana showing up here means she saved you, do you? What ability does she have to save you?" Yanson asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had always looked down on Diana, so he automatically overlooked her excellence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen stood up, looked at him, and asked, "Do you know who put me in this situation?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course, it's Roger. I already noticed his bad intentions. He set you up to bring your family down with public opinion and then take the chance to acquire your company. He's so evil, even using his wife as bait. How can there be such a jerk in this world?" Yanson said angrily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen sneered, "Yanson, listen carefully. The ones who framed me are Queenie and Steven. They took this opportunity to acquire two of my subsidiaries. Next, they'll come after you. Watch out for yourself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could only say this to Yanson.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What Owen regretted more was yesterday's incident, thinking, "I won't drink too much again, and I'll be more cautious of those around me. The more familiar someone is, the more likely they are to stab me in the back when I'm off guard."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At last night's drinking party, that friend who kept urging me to drink did it on purpose, just to coordinate with that woman who showed up later."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen said seriously, "Also, after the police investigation, the woman who set me up isn't even Roger's wife. Their marriage license is fake. They just wanted to use this information to completely disgrace me. The police will clear my name. Moreover, the news will soon reveal the truth."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The one who saved me is Diana. The person who just went in to submit evidence is Luna. This has nothing to do with Queenie. What right does she have to steal Diana's credit? She's just a scheming woman. I don't care what you do, but don't insult Diana."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Owen understood why Cecil liked Diana so much.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That's because every time Cecil was in trouble, it was Diana who saved him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that banquet last time, everyone wanted to avoid Cecil, but Diana, sitting in a wheelchair, saved Cecil once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen thought, "So, the Diana I always looked down on is actually the only savior by my side."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it weren't for her help, my dad could at most reduce my prison sentence, but he couldn't get me out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All the evidence was destroyed. So, how did Diana find the evidence? After all, I'm safe now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yanson froze, filled with intense killing intent. "Owen, don't forget that Queenie and Steven broke up because of Diana. If you're not siding with Steven, are you going to side with Diana?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen shouted, "Yes. I'd rather side with Diana than with Steven and Queenie. From now on, I'm no longer friends with them. They didn't treat me as a friend when they betrayed and framed me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yanson, you're neither blind nor deaf. Think for yourself who the most vicious person really is. As a good friend, I want to remind you that their next target is you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie would never give up such a good stepping stone like us. Your family's company has even more projects with Queenie. So, she will definitely act again. Be extra careful. This time, it was with Diana's help that I managed to get through the crisis smoothly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yanson froze. As a man, he certainly knew that Queenie sometimes deliberately bullied Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the person Steven loves is Queenie. So, he can only side with Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Steven controls the Hastings family's financial lifeline. So, he can only dislike Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Coming back to his senses, Yanson saw Owen pushing Diana into the car.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted to follow, but saw "Steven" calling him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After answering the call, George asked in a low voice, "Yanson, is the matter with Owen resolved?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1067.html">« Prev</a><a href="1069.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
