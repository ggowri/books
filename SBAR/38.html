"Diana, are you that eager to get divorced?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana couldn't hide her excitement, her voice practically bubbling over. "Weren't you the one who always wanted a divorce? Today's Monday, the office is open. If you're going, I'll get up right now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven, irritated, asked, "Where did you put my silver tie?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at the number, making sure that it was indeed Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you asking your ex-wife where your tie is? Ask your girlfriend! Queenie's always in your room. Go ask her. If it's not about the divorce, don't call me again."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Diana hung up, annoyed that her sleep had been interrupted so early.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She tossed the phone aside and went back to sleep.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But soon enough, the phone rang again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frustrated, she grabbed it without checking the caller ID, assuming it was Steven again, and snapped, "What now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ha..." A deep chuckle came from the other side&mdash; it was Alexander.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, what's going on? Did I wake you too early?" His voice was low and pleasant, instantly calming Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Realizing it was Mr. Powell, Diana quickly sat up, smiling sweetly. "Mr. Powell, no, no, definitely not! What can I do for you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By the way, I heard last night that you speak several languages. Do you know the language of Avernia? I need a translator tomorrow for a business partner from Avernia."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His voice was so mesmerizing, low and calming. Listening to it made Diana's heart race. There was just something about Alexander's voice that was very attractive.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was more than willing to help.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her past life, she had only met Alexander a few times, but in this life, they had not only crossed paths, but also ended up as dating prospects.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was all thanks to her grandpa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, yes! Mr. Powell, I'm fluent in the language of Avernia. What time is the event?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Six o'clock. I'll come pick you up."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana politely declined, "Just send me the address of the event, and I'll be there on time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright! Diana, I'll wait for you at the entrance."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana hung up, and soon received the address from Alexander.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saving the address, she got up, freshened up, and then went out for some exercise.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A few years ago, after saving Steven, she had suffered some physical injuries, but in the last few years, she had slowly recovered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After an hour of working out, she returned to her room for a shower, feeling refreshed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana went to the garden to read.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The most important thing for her now was to improve herself. With this second chance at life, she wasn't going to let herself go. She was determined to live a brilliant life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once she made up her mind, she rarely regretted it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She realized that giving up on Steven made her happier than she had ever been.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her life didn't need to revolve around Steven, and it was such a relief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No more waking up at 6 a.m. to make him breakfast.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No more staying up late waiting for him to come home for a midnight snack.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No more dealing with all the chaos in his family&mdash;it was just so freeing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, she was living for herself. If she didn't love herself, how could she have love for anyone else?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To avoid making the same mistakes, Diana worked hard to familiarize herself with the company's business.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She carefully studied every word.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had lunch in the garden every day.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Time flew by when she was focused, and before she knew it, afternoon had arrived.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had figured out all the areas under her responsibility.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the afternoon, Luna came to pick her up. Diana went to a beauty salon, and from there, she headed directly to the banquet hall to meet Alexander.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The banquet was held at the famous Sea Joy Hotel in Capitole.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana knew this place belonged to the Gellar family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hesitated for a moment at the entrance&mdash;would she run into her ex-husband inside?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's gut feeling turned out to be right. As soon as she walked in with Luna, she ran into the last people she wanted to see: Queenie, Steven, and Jeff.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="37.html">« Prev</a><a href="39.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
