I framed Diana for poisoning his mother, but he didn't believe me. He doesn't believe me anymore. It was only out of consideration for that life-saving grace that he was willing to help me with all those things later.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I get angry talking about it. I wouldn't have exposed myself so quickly if it wasn't for you to be with Dad, so as not to make me someone who was born out of wedlock.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now the Marsh family and Steven can no longer be my backers. I've found a new backer. Mom, you must marry Mark so that the Foliot family would be my backer. Mom, don't let me down."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie looked at her mother with hope in her eyes. She betrayed Paula because Amelie was her biological mother and she herself had always lived in darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula had given her endless maternal love. She would rather not have it than give it to Diana, who was thrown out as a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Paula did to Diana made it impossible for Diana to forgive her. That was the thing Queenie was most satisfied with.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was confident about that. She gave Queenie a reassuring look and said, "Don't worry, Mark will definitely marry me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that she was confident, Queenie felt relieved. She had never expected that her mother was so capable and could make Mark obey her. She ate the broth in one breath and her body felt warm.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie looked at Queenie with a smile. "Okay, go to bed. I'm going to sleep too."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mmm," Queenie replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie returned to her room next door and called Mark.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelie, when will you come back? I can't sleep without you." The voice on the other end was full of lust.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie smiled and said softly, "Mark, have you acquired Jeff's company? He can't run the business well."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark answered, "Don't worry, Jeff is at the end of his rope, and he'll sell his company soon. I'll make sure he has nothing left, and I'll give you everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie felt relieved when she heard him say that. She was calculating deep down. To her, Jeff was useless and would always be her stepping stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time flew, and it was the third day.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana got up early in the morning and called Cecil, asking him to sell his stocks, and telling him that if nothing unexpected happened, the stock price would plummet in the afternoon.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil had made a lot of money and was reluctant to sell them. Now was the height of the stock price boom. He thought he could make more money if he hung on.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I think the stock price will keep rising. Wouldn't it be a pity to sell my stocks now? So far, I've made more than one billion dollars. Diana, I've never felt so happy making money."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was reluctant to sell his stocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana also made a fortune, but it was the best time to sell the stocks now.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cecil, you promised me that you would listen to me. Now hurry up and sell your stocks. I've already sold mine. Don't be greedy. Hurry up."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil sounded disappointed. "Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana hung up the phone and continued to make breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven, who heard that from outside, also called Evan and said, "Evan, sell our stocks."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan said excitedly, "Mr. Gellar, do you know how much money we have made? Do you know how many times the two billion we invested has increased? It would be a pity to sell our stocks now. The stock price is skyrocketing, every minute and every second!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was stunned. "Is Steven still not sober after waking up early in the morning? Why would he sell the stocks at a time like this?" he wondered.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="755.html">« Prev</a><a href="757.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
