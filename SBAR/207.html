Steven's voice was low and intense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Talk about what? Stand up for your perfect woman? Steven, I thought I made it clear. I'll only discuss the divorce. Nothing else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As for tonight, you were there. I did nothing wrong. The only ones at fault are you heartless people."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana opened the car door and got inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna drove off quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven let out a deep sigh. When had it become so hard for them to have a calm conversation?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Those two years had been peaceful; she had always taken care of him, even cracking jokes now and then, though he never found them funny. Eventually, she just stopped trying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven stared into the dense darkness of the night, his eyes just as deep and unreadable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh! Mr. Gellar, why aren't you with your perfect woman? What are you doing here? Your father-in-law had quite the incident tonight. By morning, the whole city will know."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil's eyes, usually filled with charm, were now full of mockery as he looked at Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't get it. When Diana's in danger, you say nothing. But you always defend Queenie. And here you are, keeping Queenie as a mistress while refusing to divorce Diana. You really want to have it all, don't you, Steven?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil considered himself despicable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Steven was even worse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven shot him a cold glance. "This is a matter between me and my wife. It's none of your business."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Steven strode away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil watched Steven's tall figure walk away, his lips curling into a cold smirk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana gazed out at the night, her eyes heavy with thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna glanced at Diana through the rearview mirror. Seeing her in a bad mood, she asked, "Diana, everything went smoothly. Why aren't you happy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana snapped back to reality, smiling slightly. "Luna, this is just the beginning. With Queenie's skills, she'll win Jace's forgiveness and give him her support in the entertainment industry. I don't know her motives, but she's mastered acting and charming others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You know she's pretty, plays the piano well, and dances beautifully. So why isn't she pursuing a career as an artist?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna was silent, waiting for Diana to explain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana continued to look outside as she spoke, "It's because the timing isn't right. She wants to make a big splash, and now you understand what I mean, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna was shocked. "She deliberately approached Jace and saved his grandson because the Marsh family dominates the entertainment industry. If they give her a good role as the lead, she'll become a sensation overnight, skipping all the usual steps and buying her way to stardom."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked at Luna, a smile dancing in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Luna, you're getting smarter. Just wait. This is the day she's been waiting for, and now she's got it. Even if Jeff did something stupid, she'll claim he was framed, and Jace will have no choice but to believe her halfway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tonight, Jace realized he was being used. But people are different. Some are willing to be used, while others see through it but say nothing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna was furious. "Ms. Bishop, why didn't you expose Queenie's true colors?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="206.html">« Prev</a><a href="208.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
