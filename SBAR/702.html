Whenever she was with him, she couldn't help but be drawn to his exquisite features.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What news are you talking about? I was just drawing the design and didn't watch the news."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven explained, "The child Queenie is carrying isn't mine. How many times do I have to say it for you to believe me? I didn't have sex with any woman, including you and her."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at her intently.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was taken aback, thinking of those photos, and said, "But those photos weren't doctored."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The photos were doctored, just that the editing was exceptionally good. When Queenie was younger, and it came time for her to get married, I had a car accident, and she left. This year when she came back, she often stayed at our place, but I wasn't home for many days. How could you think that I would have slept with her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time he had explained those things to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He compromised as she couldn't recognize that the person in the photos wasn't him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana gave a sardonic smile. "Steven, is it so hard to admit that you were with her? I can tell you, those photos were absolutely not doctored."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven felt rather helpless upon hearing this. He understood that she, too, had preconceived notions about him having sex with Queenie, just as he had previously doubted her without proper basis.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven grew angrier the more he thought about it, gritting his teeth slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was also hurt; that bastard wouldn't even admit that he loved Queenie when everything had come to this.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, in the past, I chose to torment myself rather than give up on you, but you never understood my humility. There is only a slight difference between love and loved, and what is left between us is just the past," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven suddenly stood up, looking at her with a pained expression. He said in a low voice, "Diana, we will not end here. You will understand in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He strode away, and only when he reached the door did he say, "Tonight, I'll be eating at home. I'll be in the study. Come down when dinner is ready.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And also, from now on, I will trust you, so try to trust me once too." Then, he left without looking back at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt that Steven seemed to have started caring about her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she dismissed this possibility. Steven had only developed a bit of trust in her because of the agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this lifetime, she had made up her mind to never fall in love with Steven again.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her beautiful eyebrows furrowed slightly, and a sense of unease gradually grew in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, she wanted to continue drawing the design, but an unfamiliar phone call interrupted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, it's me, Paula. Are you okay? I didn't know that Queenie and her mother would frame you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Paula's voice, Diana felt slightly surprised. She never expected that Paula would call her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She replied indifferently, "Queenie is your good daughter. Why are you calling me? What I've encountered has nothing to do with you. It's your good daughter who is now pregnant with Levi's child. Shouldn't you be comforting her instead of calling me? I've said it before, I will have no further connection with your family, including you, my biological mother. I've repaid everything I owe; don't call me again."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie is your precious daughter. You once said with your own mouth that you only recognize Queenie and not me as your daughter. Please don't break your promise," she added.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana hung up the phone after saying that.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those hurtful words truly came out of Paula's mouth. There was no mother-daughter affection left between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, hearing Paula's concern, she was extremely angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula was her biological mother, and she once yearned for her love as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula gave birth to five children. She suffered from migraines, and in order to treat her condition while also fearing that she wouldn't trust her, Diana secretly replaced her vitamins with medication, thus curing her migraines.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In both her past and present life, she could bear the fact that her mother didn't love her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as her daughter, after knowing her fate, Diana still wanted her to live a good life.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if she didn't care about her own life, she still wanted her to live well, just not to disturb her life anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What she resented was that Paula and Jeff brought her back solely to achieve their nefarious purposes.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She understood these ugly truths, yet she still chose to believe that her birth mother loved her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled bitterly as she had felt desperate once.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="701.html">« Prev</a><a href="703.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
