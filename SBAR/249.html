He even chased that woman overseas.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In short, you four brothers were sent far away by your father under the pretense of finding your own happiness. But in reality, he wanted you away from the company, leaving me alone and vulnerable so that they could make their move."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale clenched his fists tightly, recalling the past. Such poor acting. Because they had doted on Queenie since childhood, they never questioned anything she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Being favored gave her impunity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And whenever something happened, their first instinct was to protect their beloved Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's our fault," Gale said, covering his face as he cried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula wiped her tears before saying, "Sign the share transfer agreement. Your father's people have already infiltrated part of the company, and Queenie has planted many of her own. I'm going to hollow out the company, leaving them with an empty shell, so all their scheming will be in vain."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula knew she couldn't win against Queenie. Her recent investigation revealed that both Jeff and Queenie had long embedded their people in the company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she wouldn't hand over the company she had managed her whole life so easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wouldn't let that homewrecker get away either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula had been ruthless that night, making the woman too afraid to show her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With her status, she shouldn't have been at the banquet that night unless Queenie had brought her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next time they met, Paula vowed to make it even worse for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This time, Gale signed without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula handed him an address, instructing him to rest there, then left the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once home, taking advantage of Jeff's absence, she went to find his safe...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana helped Olivia pack her luggage when her phone rang. Seeing it was an unknown number, she stepped outside to answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hello!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, it's me." Diana was taken aback. It was Gale. He had never spoken to her in such a gentle tone before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana, completely disillusioned with them, spoke coldly, "What do you want?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, everything that happened was my fault. I don't expect your forgiveness; I'm truly sorry. I finally learned the truth about what happened six months ago."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that why you called me?" Diana's tone grew even colder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now he knew he was wrong, but she didn't need it anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once, knowing she had four brothers made her happy. With her three brothers on her side, she had seven in total. Back then, she thought she was the luckiest sister in the world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But that wasn't true. These four brothers turned out to be the demons of her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, I know I've wronged you in many ways, especially with the Harry incident. Looking back now, I can't believe how cruel I was."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale's voice gradually broke. "You are my sister, yet I tried to ruin you. I'm sorry, Diana. I truly know I was wrong."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="248.html">« Prev</a><a href="250.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
