Cecil picked up the fork and had lunch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly said, "Diana, why did Steven suddenly bid? He made Queenie's eyes red with anger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was also surprised that Steven would bid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cecil, let's ignore him. Steven is definitely not someone you can afford to offend. Don't provoke him. Stay away from him and focus on doing our big things."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil looked over and just saw her confident smile. She was gorgeous and dazzling, like a queen high above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Why is Steven so blind?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven doesn't want such a good girl but chooses to marry Queenie, who is scheming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But thanks to Steven's kindness in not marrying Diana, I may have a chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sipped beef curry soup, her eyes full of satisfaction. She smiled, "Cecil, I have been eating light food for several days. I suddenly ate such a flavorful beef curry soup today. I think it is very delicious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you have time to come over to eat lobster tonight, I'll ask my chef to make it for you. It's delicious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil smiled, "I have to come. I'm going to the company at noon. I have to write my graduation thesis by the way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a headache whenever he thought about his graduation thesis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at his distressed expression and smiled, "The more difficult it is, the more you should face it head-on. The graduation thesis is not difficult for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was a playboy, but his talent was genuine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Cecil wanted to cry. He thought, "If we are studying the same major, I would ask Diana to help me write my paper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forget it. Diana is injured. I can handle it myself. I want to be her strong backing. With me protecting her, she would not be bullied anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After lunch, Cecil went to work at the company while Diana continued to recuperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked the butler to arrange dinner, then went to take medicine and go to bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was in a good mood today. Maybe because of the medicine she had taken, she slept comfortably, without even dreaming, and slept until the afternoon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she got up, she pulled the gauze off her arm and saw that her wound had healed. But it still hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flesh had been directly damaged, and the pain would last for several months.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were filled with a trace of hatred. She thought, "Samuel is evil to the core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Letting him go this time is for the sake of better revenge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana picked up the phone beside her and sent a message to Luna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Luna, what did Queenie do today?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna: [Diana, she has a shoot today. She has been on the phone when she is free. After Eric lost his job, he became Queenie's driver.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was a little surprised. But she could understand it. It was not surprising that a man like Eric would put aside his pride and work as a driver for Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana: [Luna, keep an eye on her and Mario. The person behind Mario is the one we are looking for.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna: [Diana, don't worry. I will tell you right away once I have good news.] Diana put down her phone, and a charming smile appeared on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "That person took the bait. That's great. In this life, I will bring Queenie down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Steven is unwilling to help Queenie, I will have one less enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie has spent 400 million dollars and will spend a lot more afterward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her next step is to attract investment. As long as they start to attract investment, the company behind Queenie will be exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one knows whether the illegitimate child was born to Andrew and the woman he loved most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't find it in my previous life either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In order to prevent the woman from being embarrassed by Edward, Andrew hid her well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm afraid even Steven's mother doesn't know where that woman is hidden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Andrew proposed to her, the Internet was not as developed as it is now. No one knows who the woman is who was brought home by Andrew by a proposal right after graduating from college."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="518.html">« Prev</a><a href="520.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
