In the previous life, it was Queenie who reported the Farley family, and then the Farley family was heading towards decline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The main reason was that Cecil trusted Queenie too much, and he shared everything with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was really scheming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was shocked. "Henson Group? My grandma had eliminated this company from the list of partners when the land was being developed. How could it still be..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were gloomy. "It's Wyatt. He did it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said, "I don't know if it's him, but your current building materials supplier is Henson Group. I found this online the day before yesterday. Although the name and legal person have been changed, I checked the joint relationship and found that the current legal person of the company is the sister-in-law of the president of Henson Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had heard about this matter in her previous life, and she had seen the news about the Farley family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was horrified. There were so many traps. He didn't understand. "Diana, did my family offend them? Why are they targeting my family like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was speechless, saying, "That's just because your family's business is similar to theirs. They can't march into the market in Capitole, so the best way is to replace your family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was furious. Those people's plans were a reason for the Farley family's difficult position, but the person who caused this was Wyatt, that greedy bastard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil smiled helplessly, "It's not just because of these. It's more because of Wyatt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing that he had figured it out, Diana didn't say anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil stood up and said, "I'm going to go back and investigate the materials. Have a good rest, Diana. Call me if anything happens."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded. "Go. That matter is of vital importance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil looked at Joseph. He had forgotten that Joseph was still here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil looked at Diana with a bit of anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled and said, "Joseph is trustworthy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's heart skipped a beat when he heard this. He stared at Diana in surprise and thought, "She trusts me! She said I'm trustworthy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil breathed a sigh of relief and said to Joseph, "Take good care of Diana for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph frowned. "Why should I take care of her for you? I can take care of her myself. Since you have something to do, then go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said with disdain in his tone, as if he was annoyed that Cecil had disturbed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil thought Joseph's tone was strange, but he had something important to do, so he quickly left the ward and went back to see his grandma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at Joseph and smiled, "I'll take a nap. If you have something..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not busy," Joseph interrupted her with a smile. "Sleep, Diana. I'll stay here and keep an eye on the infusion bottle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana closed her eyes and slept.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph looked at her delicate face and smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After getting off work, Evan bought oranges and cherries, which were the fruits Diana liked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven got in the car, and Evan said, "Mr. Gellar, I'll drive you home first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana hadn't contacted him all day long. Steven looked a little irritated and nodded. "Hmm."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan started the car and drove away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the fruit on the passenger seat, Steven said casually, "You bought some fruits."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan said, "Yeah, my friend is in the hospital. I'm going to go see her later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had asked Evan not to mention Diana, so Evan simply explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven knew that Evan didn't have many friends, so he asked, "Your friend? Who is she?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="474.html">« Prev</a><a href="476.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
