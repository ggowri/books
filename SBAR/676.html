He has been helping you with your business abroad these years. Even I have been helping you in the past few years. You can't not go." Yanson Hastings was their good friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven nodded calmly. "I see. Send me the address. I will go there in the evening."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen saw that Steven was in a bad mood and did not want to disturb him. Owen had other things to do in the company as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled, "Steven, don't think too much. If you love Queenie, just marry her. If Diana doesn't want to divorce, why don't you use some tricks? I feel bad when I see this love triangle between you three."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was shocked. "Mr. Toby, what tricks do you want to use to force Diana to leave?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at Owen coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen said, "That's easy. Throw her into another man's bed, take a few photos, and force her to divorce. Some women need to be treated harshly to behave."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "These two are absolute bastards."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan said, "Mr. Toby, you will ruin her life by doing this."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen glanced at him and said, "Evan, what's wrong with you today? Why are you speaking for Diana?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because it's Mr. Gellar who doesn't want a divorce, not Diana. Mr. Toby, can you trample on other people's dignity just because you have money and power?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are so lawless. It's not a big deal to be rich. How dare you have that thought? Owen, I bet you will be ruined by women in your life, because this behavior is too bad and makes me so angry."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Evan left.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen was also angry and looked at Steven. "Steven, your assistant is insane. Why is he angry with me?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't you always say that Diana was pestering you? You two have been separated for more than a year. Why haven't you divorced yet?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie did some wrong things, but she is the girl you watched grow up, the girl you wanted to marry, the girl you called out her name even when you were drunk. Don't you want her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned and looked at him, "I think you are insane. I remember you said I was too much when we met last time. Why are you thinking of plotting against Diana now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen smiled meaningfully, deliberately provoking Steven, "Isn't this all for the sake of helping you and Queenie? You two are uncomfortable, and it really bothers me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's heart was filled with anger. He warned, "It's me who doesn't want to get a divorce. Owen, don't touch Diana. Or we won't even be able to be friends anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I humiliated her before, you didn't help her. She was just a woman. Although she took care of you meticulously for two years, all women nowadays will take care of you meticulously for the sake of money. If you pay them well, they can take better care of you than Diana."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen was born rich. He sympathized with Diana, but he also looked down on her. A woman had to be dazzling to be respected.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's previous behavior of praising Steven made Owen angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned, glanced at Owen, and said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen continued, "Diana is just a girl from the countryside. You are a businessman. You should know how much money you have invested in Queenie over the years. She is the most suitable person for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven sneered. He sensed Owen's sudden change and felt a little strange. "If you like her, marry her."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen was stunned. He shook his head and said, "I don't like her. I heard that she is close to the current movie star. I like clean girls."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven understood that Owen was simply teasing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was in an irritable mood and said in a cold tone, "If there's nothing else, you can go away."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're so heartless." Owen walked away in a cool manner.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he arrived at the door, he met Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, Owen," Queenie said with a smile.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="675.html">« Prev</a><a href="677.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
