I'll take you shopping when I come back. Diana, wait for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's tears turned into smiles. "That's great! Congratulations to you! I'll be waiting for you to keep your promise. When you come back, tell me, and I'll pick you up from the airport."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia laughed, "Okay! Diana, don't cry. Wash your face, have a piece of dessert, then sleep, and you'll feel better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought about what Olivia had just said and felt complex. "Okay! I'll wait for you to come back. When you're not home, I have no one to talk to. Please come back soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay! Hugs, no more crying," Olivia gently coaxed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, chatted with Olivia for a few more minutes, then hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, the smile on her face gradually faded as she thought, "What does Olivia mean by 'the past and present'? It's not inevitable, nor is it coincidental, so what does it mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Diana knew that asking Olivia to reveal secrets was not good for her, so she didn't inquire further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at the spare card on the table, picked it up, and angrily threw it into the fireplace next to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! Steven, you scoundrel, I don't want your money. I can earn my own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana went upstairs to change clothes in a bad mood and went to work sickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she entered the company entrance, Diana's mood was still not good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna was waiting for her downstairs. Seeing Diana's bad mood, she wanted to speak but hesitated. "Diana, what's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, do you want to laugh at me for being stupid? I checked the design drawings that day. No, I clearly checked the contract that day. There was nothing wrong with it, but why did it change? I just sold those few drawings to Steven. Did I sell myself to him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana, at this point, couldn't think of where she had gone wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna looked at her listless appearance and felt helpless, whispering, "Maybe whenever you encounter something related to Steven, you immediately become a love-struck girl and can't concentrate on reading the contract seriously."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glared at Luna like, "You actually said I'm love-struck? Dare you say it again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was thinking about this all the way, but she couldn't figure out what went wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, well..." Luna hesitated to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at her. "Say it. Can't you see I have no mood? Just say it. I can handle everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If there's nothing else, let go. I'll go to my office to cry for a while. Steven is really too much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am indeed, but what can you do to me?" Steven's voice came from behind Diana, with a hint of a triumphant smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned around suddenly and glared at the persistent Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But such a look had no threat for Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"May I ask Mr. Gellar, what brings you here again?" Diana's voice carried a hint of helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven still liked her vibrant side, not this listless appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave her the keys to the villa. "I bought a new villa, right behind your place, because I couldn't get the one in front. Since you don't like the place we lived in before, let's move. Grandma said we should move in four days later, and she will come to check on us then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven slipped the keys into her hand.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="603.html">« Prev</a><a href="605.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
