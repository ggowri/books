It was impossible for her to give it back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie said coquettishly, "Steven, I know you are still concerned about me. If your mom hadn't stopped us, we would have long been married.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Besides, you gave me the money voluntarily. You would rather give me millions than give Diana a cent. I know how much you love me. The more you love me, the more you hate Diana. Steven, thank you for loving me so much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie lowered her head and pretended to be sad, telling Steven about her sadness and reluctance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven smiled meaningfully, and his hands on the table clenched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't say anything but looked at the message he had sent to Evan. [Cancel the trending topic.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan replied: [Mr. Gellar, it's unnecessary. Watch the livestream now.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's company was not far from Frank's, and it only took a few minutes to get there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Luna and Diana arrived at Frank's company, they were stopped by bodyguards. Luna went straight in and helped Diana to go to Frank's office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank didn't know it was a trap. Seeing Diana coming in, he smiled wickedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana felt sad. Frank, her brother, forced her into a vicious woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank looked at her painful expression with gloomy eyes. "Diana, you came to apologize so soon, huh? You came quite quickly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana pretended to be heartbroken and asked, "Frank, why did you slander me like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank smiled evilly, "It's simple. You are disobedient. You are a country girl, and you should be grateful for the good life my family gave you. You did something wrong, and you should apologize instead of stealing my business and cooperation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, it's very simple to destroy a woman. I just need to retouch pictures of you and some men. These pictures are enough to ruin you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The viewers in the stream were stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana made the livestream with the Aria Group's account. In a few minutes, there were more than 100 thousand viewers in the stream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And the number of viewers kept increasing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was a hint of contempt in Diana's eyes. She had just asked Frank a question, and Frank exposed what he had done before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank didn't even give Diana a second to speak. He continued, "Diana, if you make Queenie suffer, I won't make it easy for you. I've told you that if you dare to make her sad, I won't let you go unless you apologize to her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked angry. "But Queenie schemed against me first. Why do you say I was wrong?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You two are the same type. Your methods of scheming against me are exactly the same. I'm your adopted daughter, so I deserve to be bullied by you like this, huh?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Besides, your family adopted me with ulterior motives when I was 17 years old. After they achieved the goal, they wrote a letter of severance and kicked me out. You and your family are really vicious."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank suddenly laughed, and his laughter was terrifying. His deep eyes became even colder, making the viewers in the stream shiver all over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana glared at him with a heartbreaking look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing the tears in her eyes, Frank felt good. He would not admit that Diana was outstanding and that his family was wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He approached Diana, looked at her with chilling eyes, and said, "Diana, you are not stupid. My father brought you back just to take advantage of you, and only then did you figure it out. Since you've known it, get lost and don't disturb Queenie's happiness. You can never match to Queenie."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="292.html">« Prev</a><a href="294.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
