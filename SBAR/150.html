Don't come to my office again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's expression was cold, and Queenie's eyes widened in shock. He had just told her to "get out." Panic filled her heart. This was the same look he used to give Diana, but now he was giving it to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She gave a bitter smile. "Steven, do you not love me anymore? It wasn't even my fault, so why don't you believe me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"This is all Diana's doing. She framed me! Why won't you believe me? You used to love me so much!" Queenie cried as she ran away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan frowned, thinking,&nbsp;"What a master manipulator."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If he ever had to deal with a woman like that, he figured she'd take away his everything, leaving him nothing but his bones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven returned to his office, but his mind was stuck on the image of Alexander and Diana sharing a meal in the office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The two of them seemed to really hit it off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven clenched his fist and slammed it on his desk. Why hadn't he helped Diana earlier?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan watched quietly from the side, keeping his head down. Steven was terrifying when angry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After a long pause, Steven finally spoke, "Evan, tell me, what do I have to do for Diana to stop the divorce?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Uh...!!!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan was baffled. "Mr. Gellar, I really don't get you. Weren't you the one pushing for divorce all this time? Ms. Bishop has torn up more than a dozen divorce papers. Now that she wants the divorce, why won't you go through with it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Honestly, he had no idea what Steven was up to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was right. The players and manipulative women deserve each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven shot him a sharp look. "I asked you to come up with a plan, not to insult me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Before Diana came into the picture, I thought I would marry Queenie. We grew up together, and she even saved me once. But when things went south for me, she left, and I ended up marrying Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"The reason I wanted a divorce before was because Queenie came back, and Diana was acting out constantly. You know, back then, I had just taken over the company and was stressed from both work and home. That's why I angrily gave her the divorce papers. But things aren't as simple as we thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Just like in the video you saw. The man wasn't me, but he was very close to Queenie. Queenie even proudly sent the video to Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"The truth is, Queenie doesn't love me; she's in love with the man she slept with."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Oh my God, Mr. Gellar! You finally figured it out!" Evan couldn't stop himself from blurting out his thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven shot him a sharp look, a dangerous glint flashing in his eyes, and his voice turned hoarse. "What exactly do you mean by that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan chuckled awkwardly. "Heh heh... Mr. Gellar, do you really want to hear the truth? Will you believe me if I say it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's blue eyes flickered with restrained anger. His voice was icy. "Say it. I won't get mad."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan cleared his throat and said seriously, "Mr. Gellar, I think you and the Marsh family are a bunch of fools. Well, maybe not fools, but your blatant favoritism is ridiculous. Queenie is your princess, while Diana is treated like a beggar on the street. That's the extreme here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Every time Queenie cries, you immediately blame Diana without knowing the full story. What you're doing is not just wrong. It's cruel. You've mentally and emotionally scarred her with your actions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"To be honest, seeing how you all treat her has shown me what true malice looks like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Gellar, I think you should just go through with the divorce. Ms. Bishop knows exactly who you are. That's why she's leaving without taking a dime. She knows you wouldn't give her anything anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Your obvious favoritism toward Queenie has hurt Ms. Bishop deeply. No matter what you do now, she'll never forgive you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If it were him in that situation, he'd fight back with everything he had.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana's response had actually been quite restrained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">To put it bluntly, Steven didn't know what love was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan finished speaking and lowered his head sadly. "Ms. Bishop is such a good person. If I had the money, I'd marry her myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, the air became thick with danger.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="149.html">« Prev</a><a href="151.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
