I have something to go out for now, and I'll be back in about an hour."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea's mother said, "Okay! It's snowing hard outside. Be careful. Don't worry about Althea. My sister will be here soon. I'll feel relieved if someone helps me. You go back and have a rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Diana was about to leave, Althea's cousin arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana greeted her and told Althea's mother what happened last night. Althea's mother knew everything about Althea. Diana reminded her, "Queenie should have known that Althea gave birth here. I met Penelope here. She wanted to steal Althea's child and blackmailed Althea. Penelope has been sent to prison now. I want to go over there. Don't leave the baby."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie would do anything. They must be very careful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea's mother sneered, "Paula loves Queenie so much. And now they finally got their comeuppance. Diana, even though Paula is your biological mother, I am very happy to see her family go bankrupt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled and understood her thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled and said, "Well, I feel pretty happy, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana chatted with them and then went to the police station.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana met Felix. They both were a little surprised to see each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled and said, "Hello, Mr. Jameson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix said, "Hi! What are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana frowned and said, "I saw the news. Is the girl that Penelope bullied really dead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix said, "Yes. But this case is not under our jurisdiction. We have received the report materials and handed them over to the police in Capitole. Penelope will be taken away for investigation tonight. Her ex-boyfriend and the girl's father are already in there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The victim's father had a tantrum just now. He's only just calmed down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana took a deep breath. "I didn't expect Penelope to be so vicious. Mr. Jameson, can I meet her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix smiled, "It's not that strict here. If you go in, you might be able to get some information I'm looking for. There have been four cases of kidnapping of newborn babies here in the past two years. We have tried various means but have not been able to find out the truth. This time, by chance, we got some evidence. Please. They are all in there. There are many ways to investigate a case. You are a insider, so I let you in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This case here has been bothering me for two years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded and said with a smile, "Thank you, Sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are welcome! Come in." Felix looked at Diana with deep eyes. It had not been found out yet who posted the video.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Entered the police station, Diana heard Penelope shouting, "Gale, that bitch, Diana, plotted against me. Please help me. Please."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said, "Penelope, what did I do? You should explain yourself. You're under arrest but still arguing. Queenie has trained a good servant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope was in a state of panic. Hearing Diana's words, Penelope looked at Diana fiercely. "Diana, are you plotting against me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "I plotted against you? Do you have any evidence?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="581.html">« Prev</a><a href="583.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
