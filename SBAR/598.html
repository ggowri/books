Queenie, Steven is here with me. Come and pick him up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana spoke, but there was no response on the other end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was puzzled. Looking down, she realized Steven's phone had died. The battery had drained, and the phone had shut off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Annoyance surged through her. She hadn't expected his phone to run out of power at just the wrong moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, how did it just die like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She threw the phone aside, irritated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a wave of exhaustion hit her. She yawned, carelessly kicked off her slippers, and crawled onto the bed, her feet sinking into the soft carpet. Pulling the blanket over herself, she quickly drifted off to sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had initially tried to stay awake, knowing Steven was still there, but her eyelids felt impossibly heavy. She couldn't keep them open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right before she slipped into slumber, she felt someone's arms around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven watched her fall into a deep sleep, a faint smile playing on his lips. He had spiked the milk with a sleeping pill, and she drank it without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the same trick he had used last time; otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to stay there and sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been away for half a month, and during that time, he hadn't slept well at all. Tonight, he just wanted a good night's rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had come to realize that Diana was his sleeping pill. With her by his side, he felt at peace and could sleep soundly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he thought about what she had said earlier, his face darkened. She clearly didn't love him anymore, and she was trying to push him toward Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It stung that she had been happy to answer Queenie's call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring the dead phone, Steven gently pulled Diana closer. He looked at her peaceful, sleeping face and smiled softly. "Diana, you're too naive. You can't win against me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do whatever you want, chase your dreams. I'll back you up. But I have one condition&mdash;you have to stay by my side."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven whispered to himself for a while, his eyes drifting around the room. "So, she grew up here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The place looked quite old, with furniture that had seen better days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why had Gale brought her back from the countryside all those years ago?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And why was she so willing to let the Marsh family misunderstand her instead of revealing her true identity to them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe she had kept silent to see their true colors more clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned off the light, and the room plunged into darkness. Outside, the wind howled, snow falling heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On this snowy night, they lay quietly on the warm bed, lulled by the sound of each other's heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven gently stroked Diana's hair, his expression soft and tender. She looked so serene like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night outside was frigid, the chill biting and harsh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was sitting up in bed, trying to call Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't been feeling well today. When she got home, she felt miserable. In the past, whenever she got sick, Steven would stay by her side, showering her with care. She used to take photos on purpose, just to rub it in Diana's face. Every time she saw Diana's pale expression, she would be delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But tonight, she couldn't reach Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had never ignored her calls before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet tonight, he didn't pick up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She coughed, her breath ragged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie glanced out at the night sky, watching the snow falling thick and fast. But the storm inside her chest was growing darker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, are you really going to force my hand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes gleamed with malice. "He found out about Levi. Does he think I'm tainted? Is that why he's rejecting me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven always trusted me, but this time, he went behind my back and investigated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damn it, everything was going so smoothly, and now it's all ruined."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she had known that driving Diana away would lead to Steven leaving her, she never would have done something so foolish.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="597.html">« Prev</a><a href="599.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
