"Paula, you can't eat anything from the Marsh family. If Diana hadn't caught the poison in your medicine in time, you could have..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah. If it weren't for Diana, I'd be gone by now. I've lost my sweet girl, all because of that horrible bitch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I feel so foolish. Queenie can't do anything except talk. But Diana? She's the one who stayed by my side when I was sick. Whenever I wanted to try something nice to eat, she'd be right there with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That amazing girl has been through so much because of Queenie's constant scheming to turn us against her. In the end, it made Diana completely lose faith in me, and she left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Linda, why has my life turned out this way? Diana is so kind and talented, yet to the Marsh family, she's just some country girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eric even thinks he can just hand her off to some other man. How can I trust a son like that? No way, Linda. I don't want any of those four sons. They're all worthless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula leaned into Linda, crying hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Linda, feeling her pain, gently comforted her, "Paula, it's alright. We're all here for you. You're going to be okay. If they've chosen to side with Jeff and Queenie, let them go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, Eric stood frozen in shock, disbelief washing over him. Tears streamed down his face as the reality of the situation sank in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything was a plot orchestrated by Jeff and Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truth hit him like a brick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff had a hidden son, and he and Queenie were funneling money into that kid's business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, all four brothers were being used as stepping stones for those two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had been right. Just a few sweet words from Queenie had them all dancing to her tune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were just pawns in her game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder their grandma often criticized Paula for being too visible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That old woman clearly wanted her to hand over the company to Jeff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could Jeff really manage the company? He was hopeless at it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Choosing not to disturb his mother's grief, Eric turned and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raced downstairs, still grappling with the shocking news. Once he calmed down, he called Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey! Eric!" she said, her voice cheerful and light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a serious tone, he asked, "Queenie, did you use my name to apply for a million a month in spending money?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh! You found out! I knew you loved me the most. I needed cash for a competition recently, but Mom wouldn't give me much, and Dad isn't making any money. So I borrowed your card to ask for a million without telling Mom. Eric, how about I share some of that with you? Just don't tell Mom, okay?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric scoffed, the coldness in his voice clear. Her eagerness to admit it showed she expected him to keep spoiling her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure thing, Queenie. Since Mom has cut ties with me, I really have no money left. I checked your spending. You've taken 40 million over the last four years. Why don't you give me 20 million?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can help you buy that land you want. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to sound casual, but his eyes were stormy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he couldn't accept that the sister they had all fought to protect was actually plotting against them.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="462.html">« Prev</a><a href="464.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
