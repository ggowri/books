It was clearly a bright spring, yet she was shivering with cold.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without Mario, it felt like she had truly lost everything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was no one around her who cared about her anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All these years, only Mario treated her the best!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie thought of Paula's kindness again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Steven takes action, her company will definitely go bankrupt.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her life will also end today.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie sat alone in the office until 8 p.m. when she received calls from various companies. Evidence of her illegal intrusion into their properties had all been uncovered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie didn't turn on the lights in the office. She sat by the window, looking at the city lights outside, unwilling to accept that she was about to become a prisoner.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She shook her head in pain, feeling that her life shouldn't be like this. "No, Steven, Diana, I won't lose. You died at my hands in your past life, and in this life, you can only die by my hands too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie resolutely thought, "Diana, you deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's you who deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Raventia's international track has a total of 99 turns.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the lounge, Elroy was wearing a racing suit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His racing suit was red, symbolizing passion, strength, and dreams.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His smile, highlighted by his red racing suit, was very charming.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Steven and Diana, Elroy smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, you really dare to come. This is the death track. But I need you to help me win first place."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had seen Diana's superb skills and believed that she could do it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled, "Sure. It's been a while since I felt this kind of thrill. Sit next to me later, and I'll let you experience it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You&rsquo;re bragging. Do you know how long I&rsquo;ve practiced for this race? Even I wouldn&rsquo;t dare say such things, yet you&rsquo;re boasting in front of me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy was incredibly excited inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana turned around and looked at the mountain track through the transparent glass wall.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the blue sky and white clouds, the mountain scenery was beautiful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The colorful flags fluttered, cheering for the protagonists.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled confidently and brightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at Diana like this and felt that this must be her true self.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She </span><span>was</span><span> unattainable in beauty and extremely talented.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If not for Edward, he would never have met her in this lifetime.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana will shine in her rightful place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Steven might only be able to look up to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven feels lucky to have Diana as his wife.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven walked up behind her, wrapped his arms around her waist, and said, "Darling, from now on, do whatever you want. These past few years, you've stayed by my side and couldn't fully use your talents. I won't hold you back anymore. Whatever you want to do, I'll do it with you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was a bit shocked by Steven's love for her. "Alright!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She loves Steven, so she chose to forgive him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are you two doing?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy, sitting not far away, couldn't take it anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought maybe he should find a girlfriend too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In public like this, please mind your image."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Diana hadn't already married Steven, Elroy would have wanted to pursue her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana turned around, looked at him, and asked, "Elroy, are you jealous of us?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy smiled and said, "Yes. If you hadn't married Steven, with our shared interests and your beautiful face, I would have done everything to pursue you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He actually admitted it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven sneered and said, "Elroy, Diana is my wife. You'd better mind your own business."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can invest in your team so you can compete in the World Championship."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The World Championship brings together the world's best drivers, the most advanced racing technology, and the most professional teams.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But joining this competition is expensive; only the wealthy dare to participate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy doesn't even dare to compete.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said he would send their team to the World Championship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, thank you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy and all his team members bowed together and shouted, "Thank you, Mr. Gellar!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was startled by their loud voices.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled, "You're welcome. I see value in you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy has won many awards over the years and is very capable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This investment will also bring returns to Elroy. His company shares will rise. It's a great starting point.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana asked, "What time does the game start?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy replied, "We start at 2 p.m. Let me familiarize you with the car and the track. I've assigned you my best race car."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head and said, "I started on this simulation track when I was four. I'm very familiar with the track here. I have my own race car. On my birthday, Hubery gave me a top-notch car, but I haven't touched it for three years. This time, it came with me. I'll show you what true passion feels like!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy excitedly said, "Thank you, Ms. Bishop!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy didn't expect that Diana had a top-notch race car.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt it was an honor to see this race car.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana helplessly said, "You don't have to."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy's assistant said, "Mrs. Gellar, having you join our race is our honor. Mr. Morrison is deeply passionate about top-notch race cars. If he doesn't see it, he will regret it for life."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt helpless but also admired Elroy's passion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana waved her hand and said, "Steven has invested in your team, so my race car can be put to its best use. After I leave, my car will stay with you. I want you to take it to the World Championship. You can't let Steven lose."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1162.html">« Prev</a><a href="1164.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
