What's the harm in waiting a bit?"  </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was so upset by Steven's words that her eyes turned red. "Steven, I've waited for you too long. I don't want to keep waiting, and I don't want to keep making mistakes. If you can forget something this important, you'll always forget me whenever Queenie or work comes up. That would make my life miserable.  </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm done waiting. Divorce is straightforward. There's nothing to discuss. I'll leave with nothing. We just need to get the paperwork done. It's that simple."  </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, I wasn't with Queenie. I just got too busy and lost track of time," Steven explained for the first time.  </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana sneered, "Steven, if I mattered to you, you'd remember me no matter how busy you were. If someone wants to be with me, they'd find a way. If they want to see me, they'd make time.  </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But you don't have me in your heart. You've never taken me seriously. I won't keep you in my heart anymore. Let's go our separate ways peacefully."  </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana felt exhausted. So tired. Her feelings were deeply hurt. All she wanted now was to focus on her career. She just wanted to be successful and independent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, I bought you a cup of milkshake." Alexander's voice came.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven asked angrily, "Diana, are you and Alexander together?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yeah!" Diana admitted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, you and I haven't divorced yet. Why are you dating other men?" Steven's voice was hoarse and angry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana sneered, "What does this have to do with you? Didn't you cheat on me with Queenie while we were married? You scumbag, stay away from me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana hung up the phone after she finished speaking. Alexander was already sitting opposite Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana looked at the milkshake in his hand and was very happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Powell, thank you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alexander saw her smile and knew that she was really happy. "Diana, I will work hard to make you feel comfortable calling my name."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana smiled and then lowered her head to drink the milkshake. She thought, "What's so difficult about that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Alexander, thank you for trusting me. Between people, the most frightening thing is that you sitting opposite me and you don't believe me, but believe what others say about me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone in the Marsh family slandered Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the eyes of the people of the Marsh family, she was very vicious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was from the countryside and was good-for-nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After divorcing Steven, Diana would tell them that she was the best.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was very glad that her last name was Bishop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Silly girl, your ability is the best evidence to convince me. Why should I see you in other people's words? What I see is the real you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alexander had a smile in his eyes. It was very natural for him to get along with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alexander had dated other girls before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But being with Diana was the most comfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After the food was served, the two chatted while eating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In Steven's office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The atmosphere in the office changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan stood in front of him with his head lowered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven looked at him sharply with his deep eyes, and his face was full of anger. "Evan, why didn't you remind me of the time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan said innocently, "Mr. Gellar, you didn't tell me that you had an appointment with Ms. Bishop at five o'clock."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was wronged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven frowned. His attitude changed instantly. "Didn't I tell you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan shook his head. "No, Mr. Gellar, I set the clock for your meeting time. When the time comes, it will remind me, and I will remember to remind you. You got in the car angrily this morning and didn't mention this matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But Mr. Gellar, you can forget such a big thing. No wonder Ms. Bishop wants to divorce you."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="159.html">« Prev</a><a href="161.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
