Elsie yelled, "Yeah! It's so good, honey. You are amazing in the bed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man in the video said, "Baby, let's leave here after you get Frank's money. We already have two million dollars now, and his company is worth ten million dollars. As long as we get the money, we can live happily on the island."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie smiled, "Well... Kiss me. Stop saying that. Frank is an idiot. He trusted me so much. Thanks to your help and framing of Paige, I can finally marry him. After marry him, I can get half of his property. I'll file for divorce in a month, and then we'll live together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man said, "But you have to promise me that you won't go back to your two previous husbands and your children."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie nodded. "I know, I know. I only love you and will only give birth to children for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, their moans grew louder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone in the wedding venue was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was stunned. For a while, he didn't know how to react.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Humiliation, anger, and the rage of betrayal surged in his chest, making him feel pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie widened her eyes in shock. Her mind went blank, and her heart was filled with horror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who did this? Turn the video off. Turn the video off! I'm not the one in it. Don't look at it. It's not me!" Elsie screamed in fear like a mad woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, no one paid any attention to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The video changed, and it was all the scenes of how Elsie framed Paige.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For example, Elsie put a poisonous snake in Paige's bag and then accused Paige of wanting to kill her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie poured water on herself and framed Paige, and Frank blamed Paige every time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie paid someone to slander Paige as a simp... All of these things had been recorded, edited into a video, and played in a loop on the big screen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was furious, glaring at Diana and Paige.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's eyes were malicious. She thought, "When did these two bitches come in? They ruined my plan."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Paige, is it your and Diana's trick? This is Frank's wedding. Are you crazy?" Queenie roared, interrupting the audience's thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige looked at Queenie and sneered, "Queenie, you know Elsie's background very well. You wanted to ruin Frank, so you found this lewd woman to seduce him. You succeeded. I just want to take revenge. </p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Elsie has tried to kill me over and over again. Do you think I'm a fool and I deserve to be bullied by you, huh?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you know the snake that Elsie had put in my bag before? It's a coral snake. If I had been bit, without the serum, I would have died within half an hour.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I hadn't been careful and checked the surveillance footage, I would have been killed by you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige stood up and smiled, exuding an imposing presence. It was really gratifying that she finally took revenge today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was so angry that she wanted to beat Paige. She thought, "How did Paige know these things?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="373.html">« Prev</a><a href="375.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
