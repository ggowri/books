Though they lived separate lives, a scandal would damage his reputation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed Diana wouldn't be easy to deal with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic flashed across Courtney's eyes, and she dared not look at Wyatt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keeping a young lover was nothing to be proud of. If it got exposed, she'd become the laughingstock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How did Diana even know about it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glared at Courtney, her smile full of arrogance and menace. "Mrs. Farley, if you keep throwing dirt at me, I'll release those videos. If you won't let me live, then none of us will."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Courtney was so choked up she couldn't say a word and could only glare at Diana angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned to Wyatt, her gaze icy. "Mr. Farley, a life for a life. I'm going to file charges of attempted murder against Samuel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Diana walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, wait! You can't accuse my son of murder. His brakes failed. It wasn't intentional! I'll give you any money you want as long as you sign a forgiveness letter," Courtney pleaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Courtney couldn't afford for her son to have a criminal record; it would make inheriting the Farley Group nearly impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stupid boy, he was so impatient. They'd have plenty of chances in the future, but he had to mess up at this critical moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring her, Diana strode toward the police station. She was here today to submit new evidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had quickly investigated Samuel's phone and discovered that he had been planning to kill her for two weeks and had been stalking her during that time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she hadn't sensed anything off since he wasn't someone she knew well, and she hadn't paid attention to his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been completely off guard because she truly hadn't felt anything unusual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Courtney saw Diana enter the police station, she panicked. "Wyatt, what do we do? What about Samuel? He can't go to jail!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Smack..." Wyatt slapped her hard, looking at her with utter disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Courtney, we may each do our own thing, but I only play around. Yes, I have women outside, but you actually dared to keep a man? Where does that leave my reputation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Courtney couldn't help but find his words laughable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gave a bitter smile, her tone filled with sorrow. "Wyatt, who do you think you are to say that to me? Other than giving me a son, what else have you given me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why can you keep women outside, but I can't keep a man? Stop with the double standards, will you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We both take what we need. The most important thing is to ensure Samuel becomes the heir, and then we can both keep living as we like.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we fall apart and expose each other's worst secrets, it'll only hurt both of us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Expose that woman's use of low-quality materials at the right time the day after tomorrow; it'll benefit us both."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were both in it for mutual benefit; even if she knew about it, there was nothing she could do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! I know. I'll handle this matter, so don't worry. But worry about yourself. If your affair gets exposed, don't blame me for being ruthless. If you ruin my reputation, I'll ruin you. But I won't let you ruin Samuel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Samuel is my only heir. You won't have it easy if he ends up in jail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go apologize to Diana right now and ask her to let Samuel go."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="492.html">« Prev</a><a href="494.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
