"I was wrong about what I had done before."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can your apology make up for what I've suffered?" Diana looked at him with cold eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven let go of her wrist guiltily. His arm was injured, and he frowned in pain slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana had noticed that he was injured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She glanced at Steven's arm. She was a doctor, and she smelled blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just like in the previous life, Steven had built up his force overseas. This time, he should have conquered that group of people, and he came back with injuries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was powerful, and Diana could only hide from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven looked at Diana and thought, "Does she know that I'm injured?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, I will make up for all the hurt you suffered in the past." His voice became much gentler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shook her head and rejected him. "I don't want your compensation, and you don't deserve my forgiveness. Why should I accept you when you regret it? You and Queenie are a perfect match. I hope you two will be together forever."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying this, Diana left with Paige away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She really hated Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven stared at Diana's back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana knew everything, and Diana wouldn't forgive him. Her eyes were full of hatred when she looked at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he was injured in the past, Diana felt very distressed, took care of him carefully, and applied medicine to him gently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven felt a stabbing pain in his heart, and his desire to let Diana come back to his side became even stronger. He narrowed his eyes coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan saw that scene and shook his head helplessly. He thought, "Steven has no chance."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan said, "Mr. Gellar, you have two important video conferences this afternoon. It's time to go back to the company."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven whispered, "Diana knows I'm injured, but she doesn't care about me like before."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan sighed, "Mr. Gellar, Ms. Bishop has let go of the past. She is heartbroken. She wanted to care about you when you were injured, but you rejected her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Shut up." Steven glanced at him coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He walked towards the car on the roadside. "Go to the company."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the car door, Steven looked at Evan and asked, "Hasn't that man been found out yet?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan shook his head. "Yes. I didn't find any clues afterward. I even suspected that those photos were synthesized. I guess Queenie deliberately sent them to Ms. Bishop to alienate the relationship between you two."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven frowned and thought, "That man is the same type as me. If I hadn't seen the photos on Diana's phone, I would have always believed in Queenie."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just wait for half a year." Steven wanted to know whether what Diana said was true.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven." Queenie ran to Steven's side with a grievance, looked at him, and asked, "Are you leaving?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm." Steven nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie said, "Steven, everything that happened today was planned by Diana and Paige. Frank's wedding was ruined."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan couldn't help but say, "Ms. Marsh, you are wrong. Frank deserves it."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="378.html">« Prev</a><a href="380.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
