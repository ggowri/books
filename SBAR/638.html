"His parents are aware of our relationship. I'm the daughter of your mother-in-law's cousin, and I grew up with Jeff. You're the other woman here."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you say?" Paula asked, unable to believe someone could be so shameless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom," Queenie whispered, trying to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Amelie's anger flared. She turned to Queenie and said, "Queenie, at this point, there's no need to hide the truth from her. She's lost everything and can't touch us now. Her four sons are more useless."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, please be quiet. There are too many people around," Queenie urged.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, Queenie, I need to speak up. I won't be judged any longer. I didn't do anything wrong. Why should I face insults?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paula is the other woman in my relationship with your father. You're just three days older than Diana. Even if this went to court, I would still be in the right."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula was taken aback. She'd only wanted to expose the connection between Queenie and Amelie, knowing they would attend this banquet and that the truth would soon be public knowledge. Reporters were lurking about, ready to capture everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie wanted her movie to be released, but Paula wanted to ruin that.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula was shocked. "So, Jeff has tricked me into a marriage from the beginning?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie shot back, "No, he never tricked you. You seduced him! How can you say he tricked you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marriage fraud?" Paula scoffed. "So that's what it was?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie insisted, "No, he didn't trick you at all. I told you, you're the other woman. My daughter is three days older than yours.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've ruined my entire youth and made me suffer."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie denied it frantically, but seeing Paula in tears gave her a sense of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What she wanted was to see Paula in deep misery.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula taunted, "I ruined your youth? Do you still think of yourself as a girl? It's just ridiculous when you piled on."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More and more people began to gather around.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie felt humiliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff, just returning from parking the car, witnessed the scene and was angry with Amelie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he knew that showing up would only worsen the situation, and Paula wasn't going to let him off easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a powerful figure in the business world and knew how to handle people.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven and Diana also overheard the exchange.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had already asked Evan to look into the incident where Diana was swapped years ago. Before he could get any answers, he heard the shocking revelation&mdash;Diana had been deliberately swapped and abandoned by Jeff back then, yet they believed she deserved it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at Diana suddenly, only to find her standing there, expressionless, as if everything was unrelated to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt terrible.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie had already laid everything out; she didn't care about the opinions of others. The rumors couldn't hurt her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All she wanted was money, as it could conquer all.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Amelie, dignity meant nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she had cared about dignity, she wouldn't have been able to live well all these years.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone had their own way of living. Amelie's goal was simple&mdash;to continue enjoying her wealth and glory in her old age.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She whispered, "Paula, just shut up. Maybe you think you're great, but to me, you're nothing."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="637.html">« Prev</a><a href="639.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
