If today's incident couldn't be smoothed over, her collaboration with him would be finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Zion's appearance could boost her popularity even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had always been nothing more than a stepping stone for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, there were media photographers nearby. Being seen with Zion picking her up would definitely make her the talk of the town.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was still as naive and easy to manipulate as ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was absolutely thrilled inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Swift, thank you for coming to see me. I'm sorry you had to make the trip," Queenie said with a gentle smile, noticing the warmth in Zion's eyes with secret satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zion's smile was loaded with meaning. "Queenie, once this misunderstanding between you sisters is cleared up, everything will be fine. There's no need for things to get ugly between siblings."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana noticed how Zion's eyes lit up when looking at Queenie. She scoffed inwardly, "Well, when two people are so obviously into each other, who was she to stand in their way?" So, she jumped in. "Mr. Swift, you're absolutely right. Your reputation in the entertainment industry precedes you. It's such an honor to meet you in person.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, this was just a bit of girl drama. Once it's sorted out, everything will be fine. My sister is so successful now that she could destroy my career with a single word. I wouldn't dare go against her. Since you're here to pick her up, I'll leave her in your capable hands."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie watched Diana's brilliant smile, feeling as if everything else in the world had faded away.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a breathtaking kind of beauty, and Queenie was consumed with jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's passive-aggressive comments were getting under her skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's sarcastic remarks made her blood boil, but Queenie knew her limitations. Diana was just that good, someone she could never surpass.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zion was also momentarily captivated and asked with a smile, "Ms. Bishop, would you be interested in becoming an actress? I could represent both you and your sister."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes widened in alarm. No way was she going to get mixed up with this guy! He was bad news, the kind of person who might just kill you if you crossed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was known for targeting beautiful girls from humble backgrounds. She'd been looking for a chance to expose him, but she needed solid evidence to bring him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled and shook her head, "Thank you for the offer, Mr. Swift, but that's not my path. I prefer a more laid-back lifestyle."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie seized the opportunity. "Mr. Swift, my sister can't be an actress. She's a high school dropout! If anyone digs into her background, it could damage your reputation."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana played along with a smile. "That's right, Mr. Swift. I'm just a country girl, the entertainment industry isn't for me. Please take good care of my sister though. I should get going."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zion smiled, "Ms. Bishop, the background doesn't matter. With your beauty, you could dominate the entertainment industry. If you're ever interested, come see me. I always have leading roles available for someone like you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being this close, he realized Diana was far more beautiful than Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's beauty radiated from within her very bones.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was shocked to her core hearing these words.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always known about Diana's beauty. Before, she'd constantly manipulated Paula, making sure Diana was plainly dressed so she wouldn't outshine her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula had played along, keeping Diana in ordinary clothes and never buying her anything fashionable.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had successfully masked her beauty, but now that Diana was beyond their control, her style was becoming more sophisticated by the day. Her natural beauty was impossible to hide anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie took a deep breath and changed the subject. "Mr. Swift, when are we signing the contract?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Zion's support, things would only get better for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before signing, she needed to terminate her pregnancy.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="735.html">« Prev</a><a href="737.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
