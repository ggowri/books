Let's expose who she really is.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Below were a slew of derogatory comments aimed at Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was Diana's first visit to Alexander's home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though the layout of their two villas was identical, the decor styles differed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The decor of her villa was a personal design tailored to her tastes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Leopold often joked that it felt a bit odd for an old man like him to live in such a luxurious and avant-garde villa, but he eventually grew accustomed to it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He eschewed the typical attire of his age; instead, all his clothing was handpicked by her, each piece trendy and cutting-edge. With his hair dyed, he carried the air of a father rather than a grandfather.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two were engaged in a pleasant chat when Luna called.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Luna," Diana answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, you're trending online. You and Mr. Powell are all over the trending searches."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana glanced at Alexander and ended the call to scroll through the push notifications on her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The abusive comments were hard to miss. She scrolled further and recognized a familiar account.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank had responded to a comment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He claimed she was the adopted daughter of the Marsh family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Pain flickered in Diana's eyes. The four sons of the Marsh family harbored deep resentment towards her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had never done anything to betray them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander caught sight of the trending topic as well. He watched Diana with an intense look. Noticing the distress etched on her face, he felt a pang of empathy stirring within him. "Diana, if this stuff is getting to you, just say the word, and I'll get it taken down."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His voice, gentle as a caress, carried a soothing power that seemed to calm the very air around Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her anxiety eased instantly. She apologized, "I'm sorry, Mr. Powell, for involving you. The Marsh family and I have unresolved issues that might affect our future collaboration."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wanted to be upfront with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander smiled, shaking his head gently, "Diana, do you believe I'm like Steven? Before agreeing to work with you, I conducted my research. I know how you lived in the Marsh Villa and how Steven treated you after your marriage. But your wholehearted trust in me convinces me of your reliability."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana felt a warmth spread through her heart. She smiled brightly, "Don't worry, Mr. Powell. We'll touch base tomorrow night to go over the design plans. I won't let you down."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander had faith in her prowess; after all, Nolan had entrusted the company to Diana, a testament to her ability to forge her own empire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright! I believe in you, Diana," he said. The sincerity in his eyes touched her deeply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His godlike demeanor truly made her heart flutter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the Hue Club, within the seclusion of a private room, Steven and Owen sat across from each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen held a glass of red wine, casually conversing with someone nearby. His tone was as languid and nonchalant as ever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bored, Steven scrolled through his phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon seeing the news about Diana and Alexander, he abruptly stood up and stepped out to call Diana.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="256.html">« Prev</a><a href="258.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
