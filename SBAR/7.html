Little Luna was super cute, with eyes as bright and cool as the moon.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Okay, Ms. Bishop. I've got it sorted before you get back." Luna's voice was desolate.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was delighted with her efficiency.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Well! Then call them and tell them the news." Diana hung up the phone with a smile.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">On this day in her previous life, something significant happened here. She had ended up injured, and Queenie had taken her credit. This time, she would not let Queenie do it again.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That should have been her credit.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She would never make the same mistake in this life.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, why are you here?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hearing Queenie's voice, Diana was stunned. Queenie hadn&rsquo;t showed up so early in her previous life.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She looked over and narrowed her beautiful eyes. It was Queenie and Steven.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After she signed the&nbsp;divorce agreement, these two&nbsp;no longer hid their relationship from the public. They were out and about together all the time. Total lovebirds.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana raised her eyebrows and looked at her. "What does it have to do with you?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie was surprised. Diana had seemed different after recovering from her fainting at the banquet. "Diana, only high-level VIPs can enter here. How did you get in? I was afraid that you would be looked down upon if you sneaked in, and it would be a disgrace to the Bishop family."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven also looked at her intensely. He still wanted to know where she had been for these three months.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, where have you been for the past three months?" Steven walked up to her and asked again.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was wearing a white dress and sitting casually on the recliner. She had changed and was no longer the plain woman she used to be.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This version of her was very charming.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana glanced at him and smiled playfully, "My ex-husband, where I have been has nothing to do with you, okay? Running into an ex could be&nbsp;as disgusting as stepping on a shit, so please stay away from me."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was now being invulnerable to anything.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, don't go too far." Steven frowned. Why did she become so sharp?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana laughed arrogantly, "Indeed. I've gone too far. I was so blinded to fall for you. So I dumped you like I dumped some garbage!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven furrowed his eyebrows. Even so, he still felt that Diana, who was arrogant and lively, was so beautiful.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana smiled and looked at Queenie, very grateful to her. "Fortunately, Ms. Marsh has been devoting in recollecting garbage. You two makes perfect match. Her existence proves that my choice is right. So go away! I&rsquo;m looking for a better guy."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie's eyes widened. How could Diana be so vulgar?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing that it was almost time, Diana walked towards the swimming pool, which was not far away.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven frowned and looked at her arrogant silhouette, feeling like something was out of his control.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie looked at Steven worriedly. "Steven, is Diana upset about the divorce? Why is she looking for a better guy?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She deliberately emphasized the words "a better guy".</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As expected, Steven's eyes turned increasingly cold. His rigid posture, clenched fists, and fierce gaze betrayed his unbridled aggression.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Let's go. Leave her alone. She will go home when she has enough."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie's face turned pale. "Steven, you are divorced, and you still want her back? The person you love is me!&nbsp;We grew up together, and the person you should marry is me!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven had a gloomy face and said nothing. He didn't want to divorce Diana.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The divorce agreement had been signed, but the final procedures had not yet been completed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He did not answer Queenie's questions.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie looked at his cold eyes and didn't dare to say anything more. </p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The plan today must succeed so she could make Steven love her more!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie glanced at&nbsp;the swimming pool not far away.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The two of them then walked towards the banquet hall. </p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As Diana approached the swimming pool, she heard someone shouting for help.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The hot summer was perfect for swimming.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There were several swimming pools next to each other, and Diana walked accurately towards the one&nbsp;where she had saved someone in her previous life.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Help..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana dove into the pool fast, grabbing the old lady who was already underwater, and pulled her to the edge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After getting the old lady out, she pushed off with her feet and felt a sharp pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana froze up. In her past life, she'd hurt her feet coming out of the water too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was stunned. Even in this new life, some things just couldn't be dodged.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="6.html">« Prev</a><a href="8.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
