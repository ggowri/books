Alexander was thrilled with her work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Diana? She was planning to treat Alexander to dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without realizing it, she had shifted her focus to another man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing there, bathed in the glow of the crystal chandelier, Steven felt a mix of frustration and sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clenched his fists, letting out a hollow laugh. "Ha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven mused, "No matter what Alexander does, it doesn't change the fact that Diana is my wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But between us, apart from that marriage license, it feels like we have nothing left."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana prepared a simple dinner for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In truth, Steven wasn't picky about food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She made him a light meal of scrambled eggs, braised cabbage with potatoes, and a plate of shrimp scampi&mdash;dishes she was good at and had made for him many times before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had everything ready in about forty minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she placed the dishes on the table, Steven didn't wait for her to call him over; he simply walked to the table and took a seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Steven saw his favorite dishes laid out before him, a smile crept onto his face, lifting his spirits unexpectedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dig in! I'm going to take a shower," Diana said, making her way toward the stairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's gaze lingered on her, a teasing glint in his eyes. "Sure! By the way, we haven't really talked about the... husband-and-wife thing yet..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could finish, Diana dashed out of the dining room, leaving him hanging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He watched her flee, bursting into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, as he chuckled, a frown creased his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do I really look that desperate? Why is she so scared of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His smile faded slightly as he thought, "There's nothing wrong with trying and risking embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as things get better, what's the harm in taking it slow?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I just hope that whatever changes I make can help Diana forget her pain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, he picked up a shrimp and savored it, feeling content.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Diana headed upstairs for a shower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Exhausted from the day, she planned to hit the sack right after.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't even bother to dry her hair, too tired to care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Winter was her favorite time for sleeping, and thoughts of Steven's earlier comments about their consummation were far from her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing dinner, Steven noticed Diana hadn't come back downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cleared the table himself, preparing to head upstairs for some rest, when he picked up his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It buzzed in his hand&mdash;Queenie was calling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello?" he answered, his voice low and heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven! You finally picked up! Are you really not going to help me out? You've invested 100 million in this film project, and you don't want to see your money go down the drain, do you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie sounded desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had tried calling Jace, but he wasn't answering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After their recent fallout, she didn't dare approach him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jace knew about her situation with Levi and was furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Steven avoiding her, she had no choice but to swallow her pride and reach out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie felt helpless. Ever since her departure from the Marsh family, everything seemed to have gone awry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven shot back, his brow furrowing. "Do you think I care about that 100 million? I've already told you today, whatever you're planning doesn't concern me. Stop coming to me with this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, are you really that heartless? Don't forget, I saved your life..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The debt of gratitude has long been paid off, Queenie. Don't use that line to guilt-trip me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She fell silent, stunned. Those words had once been spoken to Diana, and now they felt like a slap in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crying out, she pleaded, "Steven, I'm asking you one last time&mdash;are you going to help me or not?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="837.html">« Prev</a><a href="839.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
