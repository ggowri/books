"Steven, do you realize that one lie can cost you a person's trust forever?" she said sternly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven felt uneasy under Paula's intense scrutiny. Deep down, he suspected that Paula would never truly accept him as Diana's husband.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reflecting on Diana's words, he felt a hollow pain in his chest. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his anger, he had ignored the fact that Diana shouldn&rsquo;t have been going on blind dates while they were still married&mdash;even if it was with Alexander.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie watched Paula walk away, wondering if she had overheard their conversation. A wave of guilt and unease washed over her. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew her lie had been exposed, and trying to cover it up would only entangle her further in deceit. One lie had the potential to spiral into countless others.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught in her turmoil, she suddenly heard Steven's voice. "Queenie, you've really let me down. Have lunch on your own," he said icily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Startled, Queenie took a deep breath and hurried after him, her eyes filled with anxiety. "Steven, I was just joking. Are you really upset with me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven withdrew his hand from her grasp and looked at her intently. "Queenie, I always saw you as gentle and kind. When you spoke ill of Diana, I believed you without question. That was unfair to her. But why did you feel the need to defame her last night?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..." Queenie stammered, unable to find the right words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, whenever she spoke against Diana, Steven had never contradicted her like he did now. He always took her words at face value.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was just venting. I never thought my mother would confront Diana. Steven, you&rsquo;ve known me since we were kids. Don&rsquo;t you see that Diana came back and took the happiness that was ours?" Queenie tried to explain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven recalled Diana's conversation with her brother. Back when he had his accident, Queenie had left with another man, but he had never doubted her until now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, even if you hadn&rsquo;t left and had married me, Diana would still be the one to marry into the Marsh family. She is the true daughter of the Marsh family, recognized by my grandfather," Steven said firmly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, he hadn&rsquo;t understood love. If his life hadn&rsquo;t taken an unexpected turn, he might have married Queenie. But then Diana came into his life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Steven walked away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie burst into tears, realizing that even if she hadn&rsquo;t left, he still wouldn&rsquo;t have chosen her. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought bitterly, "Steven, did you ever know you were just my backup plan?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="51.html">« Prev</a><a href="53.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
