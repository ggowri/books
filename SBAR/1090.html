I always thought it was you who caused the death of me and the baby in my past life."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I was reborn on Queenie's birthday party. She framed me for kidnapping her. Even when I showed evidence, none of you believed me. From that moment on, I swore to myself I wouldn't get tangled with any of you again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Later, I found out about George. The moment he spoke to me for the first time, I knew it was him, not you, who pushed me down the stairs in my past life."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Coincidentally, Queenie remembered some things recently. She came to me and told me about your past life. After I died, you died too, though I don</span><span>'</span><span>t know how you died."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie started carrying out her plan to make sure Paula lost everything."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She staged a kidnapping, taking both me and herself. Paula was frantic. My four brothers only saved Queenie. Their ending was tragic. By then, two of them were already crippled. I told them it was all Queenie's plan, but none of them believed me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When the kidnappers demanded they could only save one person, they chose Queenie. I was tortured&mdash;my hands and feet crippled, my face disfigured. In the end, I was pushed down the stairs."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After I died, I appeared around them as a ghost and saw all of their endings. Maybe it was because I hated you so much, I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t realize George wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the end, George killed himself in front of my grave. Queenie got everything she wanted and became a business queen."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This time, a lot has changed. The day I came back, I warned Paula that Queenie was plotting against her. The supplements she was taking were laced with drugs that could trigger psychosis."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Because in the last life, Queenie succeeded. Jeff and Queenie</span><span>'</span><span>s biological mother lived happily and even managed to take over your company..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana told Steven everything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought everything that happened was pretty surreal, but Olivia said life itself is surreal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana didn</span><span>'</span><span>t know why she came back, but since she did, she decided to live her life fully. She wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t compromise herself for others anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There weren</span><span>'</span><span>t many people in this world worth her sacrificing herself for.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A woman who doesn</span><span>'</span><span>t rely on or cling to others is the strongest of all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana finished her sentence and downed the glass of red wine in one go.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She felt herself relax.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Coming back to this world, her relationship with her mom was still strained.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Family, to her, was a luxury she could only dream of.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Diana sighed, she was suddenly pulled into Steven's arms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She could hear his quick, uneven breaths.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm sorry, Diana," he said, his voice trembling. "I failed to protect you and the baby."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It turned out they really did have a child once.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana patted his back gently, a faint smile on her lips. "I</span><span>'</span><span>m just telling you the truth," she said softly. "My thoughts are all over the place too. Whether it was a dream or it really happened doesn</span><span>'</span><span>t matter anymore. The truth I needed... I already knew it the moment I was pushed down the stairs."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because she had once loved Steven, she hated him that much more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was because she had given her love so completely that the trampled love turned into such intense hatred.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Diana had let it go. The hatred had exhausted her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She decided to surrender to God</span><span>'</span><span>s plan. A life with regrets is the only normal one.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The feeling of struggling in despair was just too painful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even after living through two lifetimes, Diana still felt that heart-wrenching pain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her, his voice trembling. "Diana, do you really forgive me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stared into her eyes. They were beautiful, carrying a faint smile, like winter sunlight, warm enough to chase away the shadows in his heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled. "Of course. Holding on only hurts me. You didn</span><span>'</span><span>t kill me or the child. I can forgive you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Before, you hurt me because you didn</span><span>'</span><span>t love me. But that wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t your fault. It was my own stubbornness, staying by your side, that caused me all that pain."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That night when I left the party, I had already figured it out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not just that, I also saved Cecil</span><span>'</span><span>s family."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking back now, Diana realized even eyes could be deceiving.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her past life, many things she saw weren</span><span>'</span><span>t the truth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "As a soul, I was tormented by hatred. I stayed far away from you&mdash;no, I mean George. I was trapped near him, and it was unbearable."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I don</span><span>'</span><span>t let it go, I</span><span>'</span><span>ll never move forward. Letting go of that hatred is the best redemption for myself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now Diana finally understood that only she could save herself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her death brought unbearable pain to those around her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Steven, you know what? Death is contagious. After I was gone, my grandpa and Tobias were killed by Queenie. She secretly raised a group of assassins. Tobias was killed by one of them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I still have so many things to deal with right now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt deeply restless. Not finding those people left her constantly uneasy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tears rolled down her cheeks before she even realized it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was a deeply emotional person, the kind who cried at movies all the time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven leaned down, kissed the tears on her face, and said softly, "Diana, leave everything to me from now on."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt his tenderness, caught the scent of wine, and froze for a moment. She wondered if she was drunk too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling his kiss, she pulled back slightly, putting some distance between them. It brought her back to her senses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Steven, don't you dare mess with me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven chuckled. Watching her cry, he found her both adorable and heartbreaking. "Kissing you counts as messing with you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "Of course it does. Without my permission, you're not allowed to touch me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had a low tolerance for alcohol, and now her eyes were hazy, slightly tipsy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled gently and said, "You say you've forgiven me, but you haven't in your heart. You're my wife. I have the right to kiss you."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1089.html">« Prev</a><a href="1091.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
