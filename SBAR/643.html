No wonder she is yelling here."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A lady sneered, "Even so, she was driven crazy by the shameless Jeff and Amelie. Paula raised Queenie and educated her to be an excellent lady. However, Queenie is ungrateful. She exposed her adoptive mother's illness, ignored her years of love and kindness, and embarrassed her in public. Is she worthy of sympathy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Queenie glared sharply at the lady. She was furious at her words, thinking that the lady should shut up at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula was panicky. She didn't expect that Queenie had always been on guard against her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie even prepared a diagnosis to prove her mental illness.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's not true. Queenie, how did you get the diagnosis? I have never been to the hospital for a checkup. I don't have a mental illness. This is just an excuse for yourself to feign innocence. But Queenie, what you three have done is disgusting. No matter what you do, it can't make up for the harm you have caused me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula repeatedly emphasized, "Everyone, I am not a mental patient. The ones who are sick are Jeff and Queenie. She did it on purpose. She teamed up with Steven to plot against Diana. At her birthday party, she bribed Megan, the servant, to kidnap herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven even knocked Diana unconscious that day. Their purpose was to get me to kick her out of the family. I really fell into their trap. Everyone, think about it. I have nothing now. Let's wait and see who will take over my company in the end."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula, who knew her well, was well prepared, for she was not easy to deal with.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she suddenly couldn't understand Paula. Why did she involve Steven in this matter?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven recalled that he hit Diana. At that time, he was really angry and only focused on Queenie, who was injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no time to pay attention to the truth of the matter. Diana said firmly, "Steven, I didn't do it. Why don't you believe me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lost all his rationality and beat her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would hate him for the rest of her life because of this.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven suddenly glanced at Diana beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was expressionless. She remained indifferent and just watched everything coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People around were talking about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is really explosive news. Queenie and Steven are probably responsible for the downfall of the Barnes Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! It's known to all how much Steven dotes on Queenie. I hear she's in a movie invested by him right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I once saw that Mr. Gellar booked an entire shopping mall for Queenie. His fondness for her is unparalleled."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several young, wealthy ladies were excited and envious of Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although Queenie is a shameless bitch, I envy Mr. Gellar's love for her. I also want such an affectionate boyfriend like him."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven listened to their discussions and compared them with the harm he had done to Diana. It suddenly dawned on him that he had really broken her heart thoroughly. Gazing at her indifferent appearance, he finally couldn't help but walk out and look at Paula.
