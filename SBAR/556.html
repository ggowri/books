Jeff's face grew darker, his expression as harsh as iron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Paula hurled the words she knew would cut him deeply, calling him a freeloader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words were calculated, intended to sting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff gave a bitter laugh. "So, Paula, you finally said it. All these years, you've looked down on me, haven't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula raised an eyebrow, feigning innocence. "Did I say that? I might have been a bit too emotional; I'm not even sure what I said. But listen, Jeff, I have some lingering debts; they've gotten out of hand, and people are calling day and night to collect. Please, sell the company, just this once, to help me get back on my feet. My father's assets are almost sold out. There are still a few villas, but that's not enough. Azure Group just pulled their investment of five billion; I'm out of options. Jeff, please."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff released her, recoiling as if she were something unspeakably filthy. "The company is mine, Paula. There's no way I'll sell it for you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're done, and tomorrow morning, we're getting a divorce. Your debts are your responsibility."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie crouched down, her smile smug. "Mom, as you can see, it's not that we don't want to help you&mdash;it's that we simply can't."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula looked at Queenie with a cold sneer. "I raised you, shaped you into the person you are today, yet this is how you repay me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Paula Marsh, how I repay you?" Queenie's laugh was filled with malice. "Consider it what you owe me. I have no regrets."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze was sharp, amused by Paula's misfortune, convinced Paula owed her family. It was only fair that Paula should suffer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she was wealthy enough to attract Jeff's attention and foolish enough to bring Jeff, a man as unreliable as a wolf, into her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Paula Marsh...," Paula sneered bitterly. "How quick you are to call me 'Mrs. Paula Marsh' now. How fitting..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had foreseen the outcome, but it still hurt. Deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the girl she had lovingly raised, yet here she was, treating her with nothing but disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And as for her dear Diana, she would never, in this lifetime, hear her call her 'Mom' again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Voice-breaking, Paula cried out. "Queenie, you're worse than a beast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paula, you&mdash;" Queenie's face contorted with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Say that again. Do you dare call me a beast?" Queenie seized Paula's hair, pulling hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula's laugh was scornful, full of grief. "Your real mother is a bitch, and only someone like her could give birth to a heartless beast like you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smack&mdash;Queenie slapped her across the face, trembling with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie! What are you doing? She raised you for over twenty years; how can you hit her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff reprimanded her, a pang of sympathy crossing his face as he looked at the fragile Paula.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, why bother reasoning with her? Just file for divorce tomorrow." Queenie remembered Jace's advice&mdash;the Barnes family assets were already mostly liquidated; grabbing what was left would be tricky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she had another plan. She could manipulate Eric into seizing the real estate left in the names of Paula's parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't inherit it herself, but Eric could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tracey, also nearby, chimed in. "Yes, Jeff, file for the divorce tomorrow. These debts are hers alone. Let her pay them herself; it has nothing to do with us."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="555.html">« Prev</a><a href="557.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
