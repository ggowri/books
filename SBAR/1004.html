Although it was very cold in the evening, meeting Jeff had put her in a very bad mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She agreed and smiled brightly at Alexander, "Alexander, then please help me. I can't walk right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would take her three more months before she dared to stand and walk. She needed to take good care of herself to avoid any long-term effects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled gently, "It would be my pleasure!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked over, helped Diana into the wheelchair, and covered her with a thin blanket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he pushed her forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the bustling streets, people were coming and going. The lights of the building across the street shone. She looked up, her smile dazzling under the lights. "Alexander, let's go to Crystal Square. There's a business event tonight. It must be lively."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at her bright smile, his eyes filled with affection. She looked so beautiful when she smiled. "Alright! Diana, let's go to Crystal Square."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Capitole was very lively, the street was a grand spectacle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The commercial street was bustling, and there were roasted chestnuts being sold by the roadside. A young couple had just bought some and were walking away, looking so happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana loved roasted chestnuts. She glanced over and thought that roasted chestnuts were the best in winter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander noticed the look on her face. He pushed the wheelchair toward the vendor and asked, "Diana, do you want to eat roasted chestnuts?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana really wanted some. She loved them and always bought them whenever she saw them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though her stomach was full, she still had the craving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, Alexander. I love roasted chestnuts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled. He had once seen couples sharing roasted chestnuts, looking very happy. He looked at the lady selling them and said, "One serving of roasted chestnuts, please."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lady, noticing Alexander's handsome appearance and seeing the beautiful Diana, smiled and gave them the best portion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander handed her a hundred-dollar bill without asking for change and pushed Diana away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at the roasted chestnuts in her hand, their sweet fragrance wafting up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a bite, and it was sweet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to look at Alexander, her eyes sparkling. "Alexander, these are so good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander also thought they were delicious. He had a sweet tooth, especially for freshly baked bread, but he could control himself and not eat too much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I also think they're really good, very sweet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was surprised. Most men didn't like sweets. "Alexander, do you like sweet foods, too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled. He had once read that eating something sweet could improve one's mood when feeling down. Perhaps that was when he had developed a liking for sweet food. "Yes, I like sweets, especially freshly baked bread."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was surprised. "I also really like bread."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Our family's baker makes delicious bread. I'll have her bake some for you tomorrow and bring it to you tomorrow evening."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of his love for bread, he had found a personal baker just for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some habits were a form of spiritual comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whenever he wanted to eat bread, he could easily get it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Growing up in loneliness, food had become his emotional support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana considered him a friend and didn't refuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay! Alexander, then thank you. If you're busy, I'll have Luna pick it up. I won't stand on ceremony."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pushed her along the sidewalk. After taking a bite of the chestnut, he said, "If I have time, I'll bring it to you tomorrow evening."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana invited him warmly. "Alexander, then let's have dinner together tomorrow night, at my place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes narrowed. She wasn't staying at her home. He had passed by her place the night before and saw the lights on, but he knew she wasn't home. She was living in the house Steven had lived in before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she said she was going to stay at home tonight, he was happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright!" The simple word carried a deep joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan pushed Steven out and they saw Diana and Alexander gradually walking away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was furious. He thought, "Damn it, this scene makes me incredibly angry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan sensed his anger but didn't speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the woman he liked laughing and talking with another man was truly painful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan lowered his eyes and asked, "Mr. Gellar, should we go home?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven fixed his gaze on Diana's disappearing figure. With so many people around, their silhouettes quickly disappeared in the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He closed his eyes and said with a low voice, "Let's go back. Speed up the plan and investigate Mysterium Organization. We need to clarify Andrew and George's identities and find my parents. Once we do, we'll have Queenie and George taken care of."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't allow Alexander to covet his wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was eager. "Okay, okay, Mr. Gellar. I've been investigating. Andrew gave us a chance. We have people monitoring him, just waiting for them to make a move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As soon as they act, we'll know who they are."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven nodded faintly. "Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day was the day construction at the site began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was thrilled. She watched as the machines started working, and the workers were busy. She smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the cold wind, she wore a red coat with delicate makeup. Today was a joyful day, and she was happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario stood behind her, dressed in a black coat, looking every bit the elite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled with excitement, "Ms. Marsh, once the shopping mall here is completed, it will become a landmark building."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was filled with suppressed excitement and anticipation as he gazed at the construction site.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Queenie's brainchild, and it was also the key to his future career advancement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was equally happy. Her career would rise because of this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie and Mario were both very happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a cry rang out from the construction site. "Bad news. There's an ancient tomb!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scream instantly shattered the previously hopeful atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, sirens grew louder as authorities quickly arrived at the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A line of official cars screeched to a halt, and a group of uniformed, serious-looking staff hurried out of the cars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie froze at the sight. Realizing what was happening, she heard the workers shouting, "There's not only an ancient tomb, but it looks like there's a palace, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was stunned, as though struck by lightning, standing frozen in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes widened in disbelief as she stared at the chaotic construction site.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the key project to launch her career. She had invested everything into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they had unearthed an ancient tomb. The land couldn't be developed, and she would lose everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair surged through her, overwhelming her in an instant. Her face turned ashen, her lips trembling uncontrollably. Her hands clenched into fists so tightly that her nails almost dug into her flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could this happen? How could this happen!" She screamed in despair, her eyes filled with tears. In the chaotic haze of her dreams, she never imagined this would happen!</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1003.html">« Prev</a><a href="1005.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
