The man was young and handsome. Elroy was a playboy, while this man was rebellious. Nolan said, "It's fine, let's go take a look."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at the leading man and asked, "Are you Elroy's elder brother, Tanner Morrison?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana knew Tanner. He and Elroy competed for the heir's position, and Elroy eventually lost. Elroy was arrogant, but Tanner was deeply scheming.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy couldn't compete with Tanner.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner was surprised that Diana knew him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Steven is here too. This man is tricky. But this land is even more valuable."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the banquet, Tanner could also see them, but he didn't greet them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at Steven, his expression unreadable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner looked at Diana and said bluntly, "Ms. Bishop, Elroy was too foolish to sell this land to you at a low price. I&rsquo;m here today to let you know that our family doesn&rsquo;t agree with his decision. You can&rsquo;t use this land."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana calmly said, "Mr. Tanner Morrison, I bought this land half a year ago, and now you're telling me your family disagrees. The Morrison family is a prominent one, surely you understand the rules here, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We've already signed the contract, so it doesn't matter if you disagree now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner said, "Right..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "This land has always been mine. All our procedures and processes are legal and compliant. May I ask why you're trying to stop our construction site from starting work?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's words were sharp. She was very angry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is a prime piece of land. All the future profits should be hers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy lost the bet. She knew in advance there were hot springs here, and this land would have great prospects in the future.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Morrison family never cared about this land, but Tanner was easily persuaded to cause trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner said, "Ms. Bishop, you must have known the value of this land in advance, which is why you tricked Elroy into selling it to you, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Back then, you won this land through a racing bet. You're so cunning."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You wouldn't miss such an opportunistic chance."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana found it quite funny.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She smiled at him and said, "Mr. Tanner Morrison, a bet is a bet. Back then, Elroy willingly sold the land to me. Whatever the reason, we signed a contract, and it has nothing to do with anyone else. Today, our construction site is starting work. Either you leave on your own, or I&rsquo;ll have the police handle this matter."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana raised her phone and said, "I have all the legal documents for this land. Mr. Tanner Morrison, please leave here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner sneered and said, "What if I don't leave?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took a document from his subordinate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said smugly, "Ms. Bishop, I also have a document here proving this land is mine."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana insisted on starting construction today.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at Nolan and said, "Call the police and get the relevant authorities to investigate."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner presented the evidence. Then the ownership of this land became disputed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nolan said, "Alright!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner felt that Diana was really impulsive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she called the police, the construction start time would be delayed even further.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Bishop, this land is mine."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled, "Oh really? We'll find out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stepped forward and said, "Mr. Tanner Morrison, the legal department of the Gellar Group will also thoroughly investigate this matter."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner looked at Steven and felt he was not someone easy to mess with.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner just wanted Diana to return the land to him, but he didn't want to pay, so he could only use special means to take it back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner said, "Mr. Gellar, this is between Ms. Bishop and me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "Ms. Bishop is my wife. In my presence, please address her as Mrs. Gellar."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner said helplessly, "Mrs. Gellar, I need a satisfactory answer to this matter. We also have evidence. The lawyer can prove that this land is mine."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The land belongs to Elroy and has nothing to do with you. We recorded a video during the transaction," Diana reminded him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner said in surprise, "What? You even recorded a video?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "I was afraid he might regret it later, so the next morning when we went to handle the paperwork, we recorded everything on video."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Tanner Morrison, if you think the land is yours, please bring Elroy over. We'll confront each other face to face."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But my construction site will definitely start work today."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Our company's legal team has dozens of people. They will definitely give you a satisfactory answer within today."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was aggressive. She was very serious about her work.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was no longer the lively and adorable girl but indifferent and distant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner said, "Elroy is not at home. He's abroad now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "Then we'll wait for him to come back to resolve this matter. But today, we have to start work. If you insist on not leaving, both the person who instigated you to cause trouble and you will have to go to the police station."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner sneered and said, "Ms. Bishop, there's a dispute over the ownership of this land. You can't start construction now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner is determined to get this land.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was displeased. She knew Queenie would cause trouble, but she didn't expect such a dispute.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana took out her phone and called Elroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The first call didn't go through, so she made a second one.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner reminded her, "Ms. Bishop, there's no need to call again. Elroy has a game today and won't answer anyone's calls, let alone yours."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled confidently, "Not necessarily. Do you know why he sold the land to me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner scoffed, "Because you're cunning. You took advantage of him when he wasn't clear-headed at night and deliberately seduced him to sell you the land."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've already talked to him about this. That night, he was very tired and didn't clearly hear what you said."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said helplessly, "He was indeed not clear-headed that night. But the next morning, he went with me to handle the paperwork. Was he not clear-headed then as well?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner said, "Ms. Bishop, you know better than anyone how you got this land."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana snorted coldly and said, "Let me tell you why I got this land. Also, he will definitely answer my call today. Do you believe it?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1154.html">« Prev</a><a href="1156.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
