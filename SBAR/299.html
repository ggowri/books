Diana knew that was because she was still his wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana had lost her expectations for Steven in her previous life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled calmly, "No, I'm not in love yet. I'm different from you. Even if I fall in love with another man, I will start a relationship after the divorce. Alexander is my business partner. Don't think that others are as unfaithful as you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, how did you become like this? You are sharp-tongued now." Steven looked at Diana with a frown, not knowing when she didn't smile in front of him. She was beautiful when she smiled at Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana snorted and thought, "How did I become like this? Humph, I became like this because they forced me to death in my previous life. In this new life, I naturally have to make some changes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is just the beginning. Many games are waiting for them, and I will get back at them bit by bit."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana sneered, "You forced me to become like this. You came to me in a hurry. Huh, are you going to avenge Queenie?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The person who ruined her this time is Frank. I believe that with your ability, you can help Queenie restore her reputation. After all, she is your beloved one."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled with a hint of sarcasm and provocation in her eyes. She turned around and returned to the company with elegant steps.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan thought, "Wow, Ms. Bishop is so cool."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He asked, "Mr. Gellar, aren't we going to talk to Ms. Bishop about cooperation?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven turned around and said, "No. She doesn't want to see me now. Let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan was surprised, not understanding Steven's intention. Steven had postponed the international conference to come to see Diana, but he gave up and wanted to go back to the company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven asked Evan, "Where did Queenie go?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan replied, "She went to see Jace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven narrowed his eyes and said, "Keep an eye on her. Report all her actions to me in time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven didn't expect that Queenie would go to see Jace. Queenie hadn't gotten Rita's favor before, and she went to seek support from the Foliot family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven knew Jace very well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven guessed that it wouldn't be long before the trending topics about Queenie were canceled, and Queenie could still be the female lead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's action could not hurt Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Steven's calm look, Evan suddenly had a strange feeling. He had always been straightforward, and he said, "Mr. Gellar, are you finally not bewitched by Queenie?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="298.html">« Prev</a><a href="300.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
