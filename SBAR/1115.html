If she was tired enough, she could sleep by the side of the road.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She loved the spring sun. On windless days, she</span><span>'</span><span>d turn her back to the sun, find a spot to lean against, and take the sweetest nap.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She also loved napping on a small boat, gently rocking back and forth. It was so relaxing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Thank you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, I'm your husband. You don't need to thank me," he said, staring at her with a gentle smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought for a moment and said, "But you've never made me feel like I have a husband."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Back then, I had a family, a husband, but it always felt like I had nothing. I had to face being framed and all your accusations alone."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grandma and Althea would comfort me, but other than that, no one cared about how I felt. Back then, I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t even dare to reach out to Grandpa. When I left, he warned me not to call him unless I was coming home."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying it, she felt the words sounded a bit off, especially the first sentence. It made her seem like a woman with an insatiable desire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven walked in with a smile and leaned close to her ear. "Darling, give me a chance now, and I'll make sure you feel it. I'm sorry I didn't make you feel like you had a husband before. From now on, I'll make sure you know how wonderful it is to have one. And... everything before, that was my fault."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's face turned red instantly, feeling like she had just walked straight into her own trap.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wiped the sweat off her forehead and thought, "Why did I say something like that? No, speaking my mind isn</span><span>'</span><span>t shameful."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana quickly composed herself. "Move aside, I need to start getting ready."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven kissed her cheek and left the bathroom with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The first rule of dating is to flirt occasionally, make them blush and their heart race&mdash;then their heartbeat will follow yours.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had never been in a relationship. Evan said being nice to Queenie was dating, but he didn</span><span>'</span><span>t think so. Love was about caring for the other person</span><span>'</span><span>s feelings, making them feel truly happy&mdash;that was real love.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven went back to his room, put on his shoes, and headed downstairs to freshen up. Soon, he reached the kitchen and saw Luna and Evan making breakfast.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two stood very close. Ever since they got together, they didn</span><span>'</span><span>t care who was around&mdash;they were always glued to each other.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Evan looks excited. Did they sleep together last night?" he wondered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven walked up behind them and suddenly said, "Good morning!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan had just kissed Luna on the cheek when Steven's sudden voice startled him. He quickly pulled away, his face turning bright red.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna blushed and kept washing the vegetables. Evan flashed Steven a bright smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven thought, men are so different when they're in love. Now, Evan's attention was constantly on Luna.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven walked over and poured himself a glass of water.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna said, "Morning, Steven. I heard Diana forgave you. That</span><span>'</span><span>s really good news. There</span><span>'</span><span>s some coffee over there, go help yourself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven chuckled, "Luna, you</span><span>'</span><span>re so thoughtful. When you two get married, I</span><span>'</span><span>ll gift you a new house. If there</span><span>'</span><span>s a villa nearby you like, just let me know."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna's eyes widened in shock. She hadn't expected a cup of coffee to earn her a multi-million-dollar villa.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, we heard you and Diana made up. Congrats. We made coffee for you too," two voices chimed in from behind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven turned around to see Nick and Barry staring at him expectantly. Clearly, they were tempted by the idea of a new house too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven raised an eyebrow, feeling pleased to earn their approval. They were Diana</span><span>'</span><span>s closest friends, after all. "Alright, when you two get married, I</span><span>'</span><span>ll get you a house too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick chuckled. Barry, on the other hand, dashed over excitedly. "Steven, I</span><span>'</span><span>m not a fan of the villas around here. The maintenance fees are insane&mdash;enough to raise two kids! I want a big apartment instead. Get me a big apartment!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He would absolutely accept a house from Steven with all his heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven laughed, "Alright! Once you pick an apartment, call Evan. He</span><span>'</span><span>ll take care of it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan was speechless. A simple blessing had earned such a hefty reward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Diana let out a cold snort. Luna and the other two immediately straightened up, looking at her respectfully and saying in unison, "Good morning, Diana."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three of them smiled, unable to hide their excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was furious, pointing at the three of them. Steven's actions would only fuel their greed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You three sold me out for an apartment."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Actually, even if Steven didn</span><span>'</span><span>t give them a new apartment, she had already prepared homes for them. They grew up together, and if she was happy, she naturally wanted them to be happy too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three exchanged awkward glances, a bit embarrassed. After all, wishing her happiness in exchange for multimillion-dollar apartments was a steal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna smiled and said, "Diana, didn</span><span>'</span><span>t you forgive Steven already?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana raised an eyebrow, staring at Steven with a smirk. "Who said I forgave him? I</span><span>'</span><span>m just giving him a chance."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her past life, if it weren</span><span>'</span><span>t for Steven causing her and her child</span><span>'</span><span>s death, she could have endured everything else.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "But since Steven wants to give you the apartments, just take them. He</span><span>'</span><span>s loaded."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna laughed. Nick and Barry looked pleased too. "Alright, Diana."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana asked, "Is breakfast ready? After breakfast, I</span><span>'</span><span>m heading to the office today."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was back. She needed to go to the office to hand over her work and pass the company matters to him. Many people wanted Steven</span><span>'</span><span>s CEO position, but she didn</span><span>'</span><span>t. She just wanted a break.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna said excitedly, "Diana, you and Steven wait a bit. Breakfast will be ready soon."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven turned around to pour some coffee and poured another cup for Diana. He handed it to her. "Diana, have some coffee first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana took it, drank half, and said, "Today we</span><span>'</span><span>ll go to the office to hand over the work. After that, the company is yours."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "Alright! I</span><span>'</span><span>ll handle the company. Nothing else changes."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nothing else changes meant he wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t take back everything he had given her before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana got interested, smiled, and asked, "Steven, aren</span><span>'</span><span>t you afraid I</span><span>'</span><span>ll fall for someone else if you don</span><span>'</span><span>t take your assets back?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven gave a confident smile. "Diana, I</span><span>'</span><span>m not afraid. If you really fall for someone else, it just means I</span><span>'</span><span>m not a good husband and failed to satisfy you in some way."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought, "Well, at least he</span><span>'</span><span>s self-aware. But... in some ways? Is he hinting at something?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1114.html">« Prev</a><a href="1116.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
