Outside was the security door. Through it, he saw Dylan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He growled, "It's the middle of the night. What are you </span><span>fucking </span><span>doing? </span><span>Gonna</span><span> wake the neighbors</span><span>?</span><span> Have you forgotten your manners?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric felt a surge of anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing him, Dylan thought about what Queenie had said&mdash;Eric was the heir, while they could only get dividends.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan would never accept this arrangement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was no way he&rsquo;d let Eric control the entire company.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan rattled the security door a few times, his eyes dark and cold as he stared at Eric. "Eric, </span><span>Paula</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s</span><span> </span><span>loaded, but liv</span><span>ing</span><span> in a place like this</span><span>?</span><span> </span><span>Acting a show</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing that, Eric frowned slightly. "Dylan, what&rsquo;s that supposed to mean?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan let out a cold laugh, his eyes fixed on Eric. "Eric, why don&rsquo;t you open the door first? Let me in, and then we&rsquo;ll talk."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I&rsquo;m going to settle this. </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Paula</span><span style="font-style: italic;">&rsquo;</span><span style="font-style: italic;">s</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">fortune belongs to me too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric said, "You can come in..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Eric," Dylan suddenly shouted, "</span><span>We</span><span> haven&rsquo;t divided the family yet. This is our home, not just yours. What are you trying to threaten me with?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dylan, what have you become?" Eric was shocked and furious. He couldn&rsquo;t help but snap at Dylan, glaring at him intensely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They hadn&rsquo;t seen each other in over a year, and Dylan had grown increasingly irritable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric didn&rsquo;t say anything else and opened the door.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Noticing Dylan&rsquo;s injured finger, Eric froze for a moment. He asked, "What happened to your finger? How did you get hurt?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment it was mentioned, Dylan got furious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sneered, "Simple. Diana's boy toy</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s doing</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric had been so angry earlier that he&rsquo;d completely forgotten about what happened tonight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He&rsquo;s Diana&rsquo;s bodyguard, not a boy toy. Don&rsquo;t you feel ashamed saying that? Aren&rsquo;t you a man too?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan let out a cold snort and fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He and Eric walked back to the living room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing their voices, Paula got up as well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was wearing pink pajamas with a shawl draped over her shoulders. She looked exhausted. Ever since the trouble at home, her sleep had been restless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though the rooms were small, she felt oddly at ease.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Dylan, she frowned, "It&rsquo;s one thing to come back in the middle of the night, but why did you bang on the door so loud?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you wake the neighbors, they&rsquo;ll definitely think you&rsquo;re rude."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan walked over, and snapped back, "</span><span>T</span><span>his is all your fault. You have money, but you don&rsquo;t live in a big house. </span><span>Y</span><span>ou chose to live here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If we lived in a standalone villa, we could do whatever we wanted without worrying about bothering the neighbors. </span><span>Y</span><span>ou </span><span>ma</span><span>de</span><span> </span><span>life hard for yourself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan's arrogant attitude made Paula realize that Queenie had been driving a wedge between him and their relationship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula looked at him coldly and asked, "I have money? Then where is it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>S</span><span>top pretending. Queenie told me everything. </span><span>E</span><span>verything you did was to make sure Dad didn&rsquo;t take a single penny. Now he had a stroke and stuck in bed, no way </span><span>could </span><span>he take anything. Plus, you&rsquo;re already divorced. </span><span>D</span><span>isgraceful</span><span> for your behavior</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>He</span><span> loved you for over twenty years. So what if he had an affair? These days, every man has a mistress."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie has inheritance rights too. What gives you the right to take all the assets?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula was furious at Dylan's words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She stared at him in disbelief</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How did he grow up like this?</span><span> </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She yelled, "Dylan, if Queenie said that, then let her come talk to me herself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let me tell you why. I supported Jeff. When we got married, he had nothing. He lived a life of luxury for over twenty years, but it wasn&rsquo;t enough for him. He even tried to kill me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You think I shouldn&rsquo;t fight back and just die, is that it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula stared coldly at Dylan. His personality was the most like Jeff's. </span><span>J</span><span>ust as ruthless and cruel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He shot back quickly, "</span><span>Paula</span><span>, it&rsquo;s been decades. There&rsquo;s nothing that can&rsquo;t be forgiven. Look how happy we were as a family before."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if </span><span>he</span><span> </span><span>had a mistress, you could&rsquo;ve just pretended not to know."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, when you get married someday, if your wife has another man, you won&rsquo;t care either?" Eric asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan said irritably, "That&rsquo;s different. Women should be loyal to their husbands."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric sneered, "Wow, double standards much? You can&rsquo;t even hold yourself to that, so what gives you the right to judge?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan's face darkened, "Women and men are different. If a man has a mistress, it&rsquo;s a status symbol. I mean, only wealthy men can afford mistresses. The kind who can buy them limited-edition bags and luxury cars&mdash;that&rsquo;s what makes a man impressive."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If a man can buy his mistress a mansion, that&rsquo;s the real mark of his status."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric was speechless.</span><span> </span><span>He was furious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan was just like Jeff, maybe even worse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula closed her eyes in anger. She blamed herself for this&mdash;she hadn&rsquo;t raised Dylan right.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her voice was trembling. "Dylan, if you like Queenie so much, go live with her. Didn&rsquo;t you say you wanted to split? </span><span>W</span><span>e don&rsquo;t have much, just this house. </span><span>But it</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s </span><span>under my name. But guess what? I&rsquo;m not dead yet. You can split it after I&rsquo;m gone."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan was furious</span><span>. </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Paula really is just like Queenie said&mdash;unwilling to split the inheritance with me.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frank was missing, and Gale was crippled. Now, only Eric could handle everything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula has decided to give the company to Eric.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And me? I&rsquo;ve got nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This can't be happening. I'm her son too. She has to give me what's mine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>We</span><span> are destined to compete one day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan stood up, his eyes cold as he looked at Paula. "</span><span>Y</span><span>ou really be this heartless to me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew his purpose wasn&rsquo;t simple.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frowning, she asked, "How have I been heartless to you? </span><span>Not </span><span>enough basic necessities?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1041.html">« Prev</a><a href="1043.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
