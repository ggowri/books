Everyone has their way of surviving. You don't always have to call out someone's tricks to win.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If we expose Queenie to Mr. Foliot, it would be a thankless effort. We might fail, and it would only lead to Mr. Foliot's suspicion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie will badmouth me to Mr. Foliot. You could tell from his attitude tonight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie wants to break into showbiz and record reality shows. She aims for high-profile fame, not slowly building popularity from an influencer to an actor. She's rich and powerful; she won't settle for less.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"One last thing. The higher you climb, the harder you fall."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna tightened her grip on the steering wheel. "Diana, are we just going to let her bully us like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana chuckled. "Silly girl, there's plenty of time for revenge. Don't be mad. Go home, eat something, and get some rest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana pulled out her phone and sent a message to her contact.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tonight would be lively at the Marsh Villa. A faint smile tugged at Diana's lips. She could forgo avenging herself, but she had to seek justice for her unborn child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hadn't forgotten Steven's unfamiliar, ruthless gaze when he pushed her down the stairs, nor his humiliating words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana closed her eyes, stopping herself from remembering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff hurried back to apologize to Paula but received a call from his childhood sweetheart on the way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Honey, that bitch Paula was too rough. She scratched my face and even knocked out a tooth! You have to get revenge for me when you get back. I can't take it anymore. Tonight, if she catches us, your relationship will fall apart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Speed up your plan. I'm tired of sneaking around. I want to be with you openly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Honey, you were amazing tonight. If no one had interrupted, we would've been so happy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Remembering tonight's pleasure, Jeff's mind wandered, feeling both distracted and tempted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Be good, honey. Stay hidden at home for the next few days. We can't let Paula suspect you're around. We've kept this secret for years and can't ruin it now. I'm going back to calm her down. Only if she's pacified can we have a good life ahead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Once we drive her insane and put her in a mental hospital, then we can be a family together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, alright, I know. Her medicine is about to take effect. Don't worry; we will reunite soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her crying agitated Jeff, so he could only console her this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He felt guilty for making her live in the shadows all these years, meeting in secret. He no longer wanted to continue living this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wanted his talented son to stand proudly by his side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The more Jeff thought about it, the guiltier he felt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, honey, stop crying. I'll get revenge for you. In a few days, I'll have Paula sent to a mental hospital, and then we can be together openly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I knew you were the best, honey. Drive safely on your way back. I'll be waiting for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff finally hung up the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After bathing, Paula opened the recording sent to her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she listened to the conversation between Jeff and the other woman, her eyes grew cold.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="207.html">« Prev</a><a href="209.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
