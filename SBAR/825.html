"Jean, Amelie is your mother now. Don't call me 'Mom' anymore. Our connection ends here. Go live the life you've chosen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jean's eyes widened. She hadn't truly wanted her mother to leave her, even if she'd once thought so. This was the outcome she'd wanted, but why did it hurt so much?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head, beginning to cry. "No, Mom, you'll always be my mom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jean, you need to take responsibility for your choices. I heard every word you said to Amelie yesterday at the mall. You never wanted me to be alive. You wanted Amelie to be your mom. I've granted your wish. Please, don't come into my life again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily had already made up her mind. Once her leg healed, she would leave the city with her parents and start anew elsewhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rather than being tormented by others, she wanted to be good to the people who had raised her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her parents had worked hard to bring her up, and now, in their old age, she wanted to spend time with them, perhaps even travel together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jean looked at Lily in disbelief, seeing no trace of warmth or emotion in her once kind, expectant gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, Jean realized that her mother had truly given up on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of fear surged through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily had heard everything she'd said at the mall with Amelie just the day before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom..." she whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Lily didn't turn back, addressing Diana instead. "Diana, I'm heading back. You should get some rest as well. It's too cold out here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded. "Alright."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's assistant helped her into the car, folded up her wheelchair, and then drove her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jean watched helplessly as the car drove off, unable to do anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "My mom really left me, panic filling her mind. She really left me this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How did she hear everything I said yesterday?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Diana, she asked in a tearful, shaky voice, "Diana, has my mom really abandoned me?" Her eyes were full of desperate hope as she looked at Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana could see Jean's distress and fear, her face streaked with tears. "Ms. Foliot, isn't this what you wanted? Didn't you always wish for Amelie to be your mother? Well, now your wish has come true. Why are you crying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But... but it's different. I only thought Amelie was nice to me. My mom is still my mom!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then yesterday, when you wished she would die, why didn't you remember that she was your mother? Jean, greed comes with a heavy price."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at her steadily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jean didn't know how to respond. She closed her eyes, crying as she tried to explain, "I... I just couldn't swallow my pride, that's why I said those things. I didn't know my mom would hear it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's gaze became deep as she looked at the silver-white world around them. "Jean, you were on a bright path, yet you chose to walk into the dark. Some people fight desperately to escape darkness just to find a single ray of sunlight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you were standing in the sunlight all along and didn't know to cherish it. When you had your mother, you didn't appreciate her. You pushed away everything she did for you and convinced yourself that Amelie was the mother you wanted. You're old enough to know right from wrong. You simply didn't like your comfort being disrupted. Your mother's care gave you a sense of security, even if it sometimes frustrated you, while Amelie's indulgence made you feel as if you'd found another kind of shelter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you trapped yourself in a maze of your own making. Now you've made your choice, don't regret it."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="824.html">« Prev</a><a href="826.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
