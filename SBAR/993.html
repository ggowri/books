Ever since Paula&#x27;s live stream, the stock prices have been dropping. I had to go to the company. I know you&#x27;re strong and can get through this. I will come to you as soon as I have dealt with the company&#x27;s affairs. Queenie, don&#x27;t push me away, okay?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He looked at Queenie with pleading eyes. He had feelings for her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She was the first light in his life, the one he had once hoped to marry.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie felt a deep sadness in her heart, a real ache.</p><p style="text-align:left;">If it hadn&#x27;t been for the dream, she might have believed his words.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But in the dream, the woman he loved was not her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">George ended his life in front of Diana&#x27;s grave. She didn&#x27;t know the reason. In the dream, there was only George looking at her with a painful smile.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Life seemed so unfair. Why wouldn&#x27;t the heavens let her see the full picture?</p><p style="text-align:left;">George&#x27;s presence could at least provide her with some emotional value.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;George, I believe you!&quot; Queenie said softly, smiling at him with a beaming expression.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His face was pleasing to the eye. At least, there were few people in the world as handsome as him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">George breathed a sigh of relief. He smiled gently, stood up, and looked at Mario. &quot;Mario, let me do it. You drive the car to the door and wait for us.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Mario smiled, &quot;Alright, sir. I&#x27;m really happy to see you two making up.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He knew he wasn&#x27;t worthy of Queenie, but besides protecting her, there was so much more he could do for her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He could remove all the obstacles in her way and help her become a business queen.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In his heart, Queenie was the most exceptional.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana was nothing. She couldn&#x27;t compare to Queenie&#x27;s beauty and brilliance. Throughout everything, he had witnessed Queenie&#x27;s true excellence and capability.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As for Diana, she only had her tricks to rely on to get to where she was.</p><p style="text-align:left;">George smiled and patted Mario&#x27;s shoulder, noticing the sincere smile on his face. He knew Mario was loyal to them, and people like him were hard to come by in their circle.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mario, you&#x27;ve worked hard these years. You&#x27;ve always done a great job.&quot; George praised him with a smile.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Mario, touched by the praise, smiled, &quot;Sir, my life, my job, everything I have is because of you two.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">His eyes turned red as he looked at Queenie. From having nothing to now earning a six-figure salary, it was something he, as an ordinary college student, could never have dreamed of before. Now, he could give his mother a happy life, let his sister live in a nice house, and attend a good university.</p><p style="text-align:left;">All those dreams had come true, and it was Queenie and George who had made them possible.</p><p style="text-align:left;">George smiled and said, &quot;Let&#x27;s go back.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Mario was deeply moved, but Queenie remained unmoved, sitting in her wheelchair.</p><p style="text-align:left;">What George wanted was her support, but what she needed was George&#x27;s emotional support. Only if she loved him would she feel that everything she had done before was worth it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Only when everything felt worthwhile could she stop second-guessing herself.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Yet, George simply didn&#x27;t have the attentiveness that Steven did.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven accompanied her in the act, playing his role perfectly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He was so foolish, thinking that being good to her could protect Diana.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Little did he know Diana&#x27;s end would be as tragic as his own.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Lost in her thoughts, Queenie lifted her gaze and saw Diana, Cecil, and Luna coming out from the private room beside them.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Their eyes locked, both sitting in wheelchairs, gazing at each other coldly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie smiled mockingly, her tone full of sarcasm. &quot;Diana, looks like we&#x27;re quite fated today. No matter where we are, we keep running into each other. You&#x27;re annoying. Seeing you two or three times a day is even worse.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana rolled her eyes as if implying that she, too, wasn&#x27;t thrilled about the encounter.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Queenie, same here, I don&#x27;t want to see you either. If you don&#x27;t want to see me next time, you can just dig out your eyes.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie&#x27;s eyes were full of anger. &quot;Diana, you are so shameless. You become crippled, and now you want me to be just like you. How could you hire someone to break my leg on New Year&#x27;s Eve? You are so vicious.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana looked at her with a raised eyebrow, clearly unimpressed. A faint smile danced in her pretty eyes as she spoke, &quot;Queenie, you&#x27;re accusing me like that. Do you have any evidence?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie broke down, shouting in frustration, &quot;Who else could it be but you?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Tsk! You&#x27;ve offended so many people. It&#x27;s not just me. There are plenty of others who&#x27;d want you dead. For example, the Foliot family?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana sneered and continued, &quot;I heard that Jace had been discharged from the hospital. With his personality, he&#x27;ll probably drag you down to hell with him.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She had just learned that Jace was discharged on the third day of the New Year. He had been involved in the underworld, and now, in his old age, to have been schemed against by Queenie. He probably couldn&#x27;t swallow the grudge.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie narrowed her eyes slightly, a dangerous and venomous gleam in them. She thought, &quot;That old man is out? How could he have recovered so quickly?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">At the same time, Mario received news. He was startled and leaned close to Queenie&#x27;s ear, whispering, &quot;Ms. Marsh, it&#x27;s bad news. Rebecca is dead.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Rebecca was the one who had transmitted the disease to Jace. After he had bullied her, she sought revenge on him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Now, with her death, and hearing from Diana that Jace had been discharged from the hospital, Queenie&#x27;s heart sank. She looked at Diana sharply, her voice laced with suspicion. &quot;Was it you? Diana, did you help Jace?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana quickly raised her hand, halting Queenie&#x27;s words. &quot;Queenie, I&#x27;ve told you before. Speaking requires evidence. Why do you always resort to slandering others? You were like this before, and now you&#x27;re still the same. Can&#x27;t you find a different way to torment me? You&#x27;ve already used these tactics on me so many times. I&#x27;m getting tired of it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Actually, I want to tell you the reason why I didn&#x27;t hold anything against you in the past. That&#x27;s because...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana&#x27;s eyes fell on George, and she deliberately revealed a deep sadness. &quot;Steven, the reason I didn&#x27;t hold anything against you before was because I wanted to cure your eyes. I wanted to make sure you got the last dose of medicine before I divorced you. Steven, now that you&#x27;re doing this, how could you live up to my sincere feelings for you?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">George was speechless.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He continued to act up. &quot;Diana, that was your choice. I never asked you to do anything for me.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Fine! Then give me back my eyes! You know my treatment worked. And your legs, too. I healed them!&quot; Diana&#x27;s smile was twisted, tinged with a dark satisfaction. She had hated this man countless days and nights.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She always felt that someone like Steven would never do such a disgusting thing.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But it was precisely this man who had repulsed her in the worst way.</p><p style="text-align:left;">George recalled the year when Steven had sat in a wheelchair, blind, unable to see. That time had been the most desperate for Steven.</p><p style="text-align:left;">If he had lost his legs and his sight, he would have been unable to bear it and would have tried anything to end it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He couldn&#x27;t imagine the kind of dark days where he&#x27;d need someone to feed him and wipe his mouth.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He looked at Diana with a mocking gaze. &quot;Diana, you chose this willingly. So, you should bear the consequences of your actions.&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="992.html">« Prev</a><a href="994.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
