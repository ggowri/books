Could it be that Paula had been deluded by Diana, too?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mom, can you please stop being so unreasonable? I really can't hand over the shares to you. I know you're capable of saving the company."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He knew Paula's capabilities better than anyone. Since the age of eighteen, Paula had been immersed in the cutthroat world of business, honed into a formidable woman by the Barnes family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had always been a force to be reckoned with in the business world. It was because of her that the Marsh family held a prominent position in Capitole, and he had the chance to become the heir of the Marsh family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula gazed at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale frowned at the complexity in Paula's eyes, finding it hard to read her thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He suddenly felt tense, almost unable to catch his breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was a cool autumn day, yet he felt a chill, his back covered in a cold sweat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mom, why are you looking at me like that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula just smiled, her smile a mix of disappointment and sadness. Her voice was noticeably hoarse. "Yes, I was being unreasonable, but your actions and the answers have let me down. I just wanted to test if you truly care about Queenie. Since you do, I'm relieved."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Gale's feelings towards Paula were not as warm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie had a real knack for playing the victim and manipulating Gale with her feigned vulnerability.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale laughed awkwardly, "Mom, this isn't a joke."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula patted his shoulder again. "Gale, indeed it's not. Don't let your sister down. You're both in the prime of your youth. Don't betray her. Love her well. She's our family's little princess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Just forget what happened earlier. I just couldn't believe your father would do this to us. Alright, I'm off to the company. You take care of your own affairs."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale still felt uneasy. Paula had been acting strangely these past few days. "Mom, are you alright?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm fine. I was just testing you. Seeing how you stand up for your father and Queenie, I'm reassured. I don't believe the contents of that recording either."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jeff had lived with her for over twenty years, smiling at her every day while secretly plotting against her, even poisoning her behind her back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was just too terrifying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sadly, even when Paula presented the evidence to Gale, he refused to believe it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mom, did Diana do this? Did she give you the recording?" Gale knew Diana still wanted to return to the Marsh family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana couldn't let go of Steven. She had been clinging to him these past few years, wanting to be by his side every moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula snapped, "Gale, don't blame everything on Diana. Do you know what your fundamental problem is? You can't take criticism. You only believe what you see. Even after suffering greatly, you still trust your own eyes and don't think deeply. You're just too naive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Just pretend you didn't hear anything earlier, and don't tell Queenie. Otherwise, your sister will be so upset she might attempt suicide again. Also, I must congratulate Althea. She made the right choice by leaving. After all, if she had married a fool like you, her life would have been ruined."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale thought, "Of course, I can't tell Queenie about this. If she found out, she really would attempt suicide. If it's not Diana, then who could it be? But what did Mom mean by her last remark?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="173.html">« Prev</a><a href="175.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
