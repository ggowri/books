His small company only earned 100 or 200 thousand dollars a year, which was not even enough for a banquet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every night, he suffered a lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff got furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He roared irritably, "Paula, all this is your fault. You have lost all your property through your mismanagement. I am getting old now. Should I suffer with you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We parted ways because of you. If you had always been as rich as before, how could I have abandoned you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula was angry, but his shameless words amused her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, because of her affection for him, she had never looked down upon him. As long as some of his things were not too excessive, she would not care. As a result, she ignored many problems and his ambitions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gazed at him aggressively. "Jeff, in the beginning, you pursue me just for my money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You even pretended to be proud and refused to be a matrilocal husband. Once my parents said something harsh to you, your self-esteem would get hurt. And for your damn self-esteem, I left them and lived alone with you. I did so much for you. However, you have been lying to me from the beginning, haven't you?" Paula yelled madly. Her heart ached. Some time ago, when she went back to see her parents and told them that she wanted a divorce and that she intended to bankrupt the company, they said nothing and supported her decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She still remembered her father saying, "Paula, it's not too late for you to think it through now. Our family has so much property. Even if you don't have a job, it's enough to cover your life expenses. You've worked so hard for so many years, so live an easy life in the future. Your mother and I are going to retire to our hometown. When you have settled things, come back to accompany us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her parents were always right behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why Paula had more confidence in making the plan.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She really borrowed money, and it was her father who helped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never spent the money, and when the repayment date came, she returned it in full.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A perfect show was needed to deceive Queenie and Jeff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie sent people to investigate, and only then did she completely believe that she was bankrupt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sight of Paula's pained expression, Jeff forced a bitter smile. "Paula, we're divorced now. Whatever you think."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took Amelie's hand and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula stood in the snow, the wind stirring her hair, but she still stared icily at their backs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She beamed with joy. Jeff couldn't tolerate any mistakes. How could he forgive Amelie for her betrayal?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did the four of them want to live happily together? It was impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula would never allow it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff and Amelie must lose their appetite for lunch and have a big fight upon getting back home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they got into the car, Paula started her car and followed them. She naturally would not miss such an exciting scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna also saw it. She quickly walked out and got into the car on the side of the road before calling Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello! Luna," Diana replied casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna was thrilled. "Diana, I think there will be a good show. You are in a bad mood today because the Marsh family has irritated you. I will go to shoot it to make you feel better immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana chuckled, "How curious you are! You skipped work to watch a good show. What is it?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="614.html">« Prev</a><a href="616.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
