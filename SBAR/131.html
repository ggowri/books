Don't you want to play? I'll accompany you to the end."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"By the way, I'm afraid Harry will never be able to come out again in this lifetime. If he does, the first person he'll look for is you. I believe Gale just wanted to teach me a lesson, but your purpose is simple. You want him to call Gale in front of me to alienate the relationship between him and me. You don't need to do this, and it will only expose your existence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Because I have already severed ties with them, so what you are doing is unnecessary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It was Harry who helped you frame me before, making it impossible for the Marsh family and Steven to find any clues. He was the most loyal dog around you, and now he is in jail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You still have Penelope by your side. I hope that next time you frame me, Penelope can be as smart as she was half a year ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"She should be smarter than the last few times, so that Steven can divorce me completely, and you can marry into the Gellar family and concentrate on fulfilling your ambitions. I will watch you send them to hell one by one."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She felt relieved to have someone helping her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie took a step back suddenly, her face pale, her eyes full of tears, the malice in her heart surged like wild waves. She wanted to kill Diana, and she wanted to kill her now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana's confident look made Queenie feel panicky for no reason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana had changed and become difficult to deal with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What did Diana know?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana had said everything she needed to say, then handed the card to the salesperson and paid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Olivia then realized that Diana would fight back and would not be bullied obediently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She breathed a sigh of relief, her voice choking with sobs, "Sweet pea, you have finally grown up and will no longer allow yourself to be bullied."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana looked at her with tears in her eyes and held her hand. "Silly girl, I am not easy to bully. I didn't argue much before because I treated them as my relatives and husband. But people's patience will run out sometimes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Olivia smiled happily and said, "That's great, seeing that you can protect yourself, I won't worry about you even if I return."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana smiled, took the card from the salesperson, and said with a smile, "Let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Olivia glared at Queenie fiercely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie was so lucky!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sadly, she was vicious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her end would be horrible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was destined to be dead, how could she mess with the dead?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This was the secret of heaven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Olivia glanced at Penelope's belly with a strange look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Penelope was frightened by her gaze. She placed her hands tightly on her belly and asked angrily, "Why are you looking at my belly? I'm pregnant. Don't even think about touching my child."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Olivia sneered and said, "You have committed a serious crime, so you should do more good deeds and stop committing sins."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Penelope was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Don't go." Queenie suddenly blocked Diana's way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana frowned, looked at her, and asked, "What else do you want to do?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="130.html">« Prev</a><a href="132.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
