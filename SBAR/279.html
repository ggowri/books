"Steven, my brothers and my grandfather are the ones who love me the most in this world. If you dare to harm them, I will not hesitate to put an end to it, even if it means sacrificing myself. I saved you twice, but I can also destroy you tenfold."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's eyes gleamed with a fierce resolve. "I have already died once. Do you think I fear death now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's expression changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Based on Leopold's performance today, Diana was indeed very important to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And Diana really cared about them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven responded with a sly smile, "You know I am not a good man, Diana. If you plan to revenge, do not reveal your vulnerabilities to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Regretting her mistakes in judgment, Diana closed her eyes briefly before meeting Steven's gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She said, "Steven, I have never saved you, nor have I loved you. Our union will only bring suffering to both of us. It will only take a few moments to finalize the divorce. So, let me go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing that,  Steven smiled faintly. He pondered inwardly, "Is she going to place all the blame on Queenie for this divorce?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He chuckled, his voice dripping with seduction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana glanced at him, locking eyes with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In Steven's eyes, Diana had always been attractive. She rarely wore dresses. Today, she was donning a pink dress, and every gesture she made exuded charm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Having left behind her youthful appearance, she had become increasingly alluring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite being married for so long, Steven had never been intimate with Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Drawing closer to her, Steven leaned in to whisper in her ear, catching her off guard with a playful nibble on her earlobe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana exclaimed and glared at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven derived a strange satisfaction from her reaction, asserting, "Diana, you can't run away from me. I have sworn to never part ways with you in this lifetime."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He revealed a cruel smile, causing a shiver to run down Diana's spine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She retorted, "Alright, let's just drag this on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I will work hard to grow until you are out of my league."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Diana left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven did not try to stop her. Her final words lingered in his mind, and he smiled. Such a lively Diana fascinated him even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, his phone rang, and it was Queenie calling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hello, Queenie!" He raised his voice intentionally, looking at Diana's retreating figure and noticing a subtle pause in her movements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A knowing smile danced in Steven's eyes as he realized she still cared about him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven, I'm trapped by two men. Steven, come and save me," came Queenie's panicked voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Steven's eyes were fixed on Diana as she got into Alexander's car and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The smile on his face vanished, replaced by an icy coldness as he asked, "Where are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm near your villa," Queenie replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay! I'll help you call the police. I'm too far away to come back and make it," Steven said abruptly before ending the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He then called the police. He couldn't let her die now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie stared at the two burly men in front of her, clad in leather jackets and sporting unruly beards. Their sinister smiles revealed narrowed eyes, and their protruding bellies added to the menacing aura.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was really trapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was truly scared. In the past, whenever she called Steven for help, he would always come to her no matter where he was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stepping back in horror, she stammered, "Get out! What do you want?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="278.html">« Prev</a><a href="280.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
