Doesn't that bother you in the slightest?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana raised an eyebrow, unimpressed. "That's your big secret?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie shook her head, watching Diana's face carefully. There was no flicker of pain, no hint of regret. That was disappointing. "No. That's not the secret. The real one? After you died, Steven realized he loved you. And then he died, too. I don't remember how&mdash;I just know I don't have any memories of it. But I do remember this&mdash;he loved you. Enough to lock you away in that house, trying to keep you safe because he knew things he wasn't supposed to. And at the time? You were pregnant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I used to provoke you on purpose, to make sure you suffered. You didn't deserve that life. You were supposed to have nothing. And you sure as hell didn't deserve Steven's love. Maybe I sensed his feelings for you&mdash;that's probably why I hated him so much. I wanted him dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stared at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Steven had loved her after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, at his core, he was still the same selfish bastard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A laugh slipped out before she could stop it, dry and sharp. "Queenie, does any of this even matter now? He's yours. What's the point of telling me all this? The moment he betrayed our marriage, he stopped existing in my world. I told you before&mdash;you love picking up trash? Keep it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's jaw tensed. She had expected Diana to be rattled, even just a little. But instead, all she got was detached indifference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really don't care?" Queenie's voice edged higher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana took her time picking up a small pastry, and taking a slow bite. Pineapple. Sweet, a little tart. She liked pineapple. She finished it in one bite, savoring it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Across the room, guests were watching, but no one dared to step closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Care about what? A man who wasn't worth keeping? A love that wasn't built to last? Why waste my time? There are plenty of better men out there. Queenie, if you want to gloat about recycling someone else's leftovers, go right ahead. Just know&mdash;it's pathetic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only Queenie knew the full truth&mdash;that George had never really been hers. His heart had always had space for Yvette.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had destroyed herself over a man who had never truly belonged to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And partly for her parents, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana put on a playful smirk, her expression almost pitying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's fingers curled against the table. Her face paled, rage flickering in her eyes. So, she really had moved on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right. You've already died once. If you were still making the same mistakes, you really would be pathetic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana blinked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why does that sound like an insult?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she let it slide. She had changed. She lived for herself now. Love? That was nothing but an illusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And men's promises? The cheapest thing in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more she thought about it, the more something dawned on her&mdash;Steven had never actually made her any promises.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stingy bastard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Good thing she didn't care anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help! Somebody, help me!" A desperate scream tore through the ballroom, yanking Diana's attention back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second the words registered, Queenie put on a slow, knowing smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That uneasy feeling in Diana's gut tightened. This wasn't random. This was planned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze snapped to Queenie, whose smirk had only widened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie," Diana's voice was sharp, "what the hell did you do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie rose from her seat with practiced elegance, smoothing out a nonexistent wrinkle in her dress. "Why don't you go take a look?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then her gaze flicked downward, settling on Diana's injured leg. A chuckle escaped her, light and taunting. "Oh, wait. You can't. You're still a cripple."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana, however, wasn't fazed. Her eyes traveled downward, locking onto Queenie's heels. "Hold on. Weren't you in a wheelchair? How the hell are you wearing heels?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie lifted the hem of her dress just enough to reveal a sleek, metallic brace wrapped around her leg. "Technology, Diana. It's expensive, but well worth it. Money buys you freedom&mdash;like getting back on your feet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's gaze swept over the custom-built brace. High-tech. Lightweight. Sleek. And worth a small fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana blinked, catching the amused glint in Queenie's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was she being mocked?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's movements were slow, deliberate. The metallic brace on her lower leg adjusted with each step, guided by a computerized mechanism. But the way she held herself, the careful shift of weight&mdash;it was clear that every step still hurt. The device let her walk, but it didn't erase the pain. No wonder she had sat down earlier. She hadn't been able to stand for too long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing required shifting most of her weight onto her good leg, forcing it to compensate for the injured one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana raised an eyebrow, then gave her an exaggerated thumbs-up. "Gotta hand it to you, Queenie. That's some serious commitment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never even considered using something like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then again, it looked more like a torture device than an actual solution. The pain was still there&mdash;just packaged neatly under a designer dress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana chuckled. "As long as it works for you, I guess."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie, of course, wasn't about to admit how much discomfort she was in. The ache in her leg was constant, pulsing under her skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she could stand. She could walk. And as long as she looked composed, the pain didn't matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana casually pressed the controls on her wheelchair, smoothly rolling ahead and passing Queenie with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just before she was out of reach, she turned her head slightly, flashing a smug smile. "Take your time, Ms. Marsh. I'll check things out first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's expression froze for half a second, irritation flickering in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that she was slow. But Diana acting smug while rolling around in a wheelchair? That was rich.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's attention quickly shifted to the commotion ahead. In the middle of the crowd, a young woman stood trembling, panic written all over her face. Her voice rang out, desperate and shaking. "Mr. Farley, please&mdash;stay away! I'm begging you! Just let me go! You've already hurt me so many times. I don't want this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's expression darkened instantly. Damn it. Queenie had set Cecil Farley up. Again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That idiot really had no sense of self-preservation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far away, Cecil stumbled forward, his shirt nowhere to be seen. His skin was flushed, his breath heavy, and his usually sharp eyes were clouded with confusion. He moved toward the girl, his steps unsteady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl's clothes were disheveled, her face pale with panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terror flickered in her wide eyes as she looked at Cecil, frozen in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana clenched her jaw. Perfect. Just perfect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had just joked about not becoming the one getting laughed at tonight. And now? Here they were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She exhaled sharply. "Of all the goddamn things..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was bad. This wasn't just some behind-the-scenes scandal. This was public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well, Mr. Farley, what exactly are you trying to do here?" Yanson sneered, his voice dripping with sarcasm. "Thinking of making a move on a girl in front of an entire crowd? Hate to break it to you, but that's not happening&mdash;not while we're all standing here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a cold laugh, shaking his head in mock disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil really was a piece of work&mdash;going after a woman in public like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil's mind was a mess. His skin felt like it was on fire, heat crawling under his flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A girl's voice kept ringing in his ears&mdash;loud, piercing, relentless. It grated on his nerves, making his head pound. He just wanted her to shut up. But she kept screaming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, through the haze, Cecil's eyes locked onto the girl. Something inside him snapped. He raised a shaky hand and pointed straight at her, his voice rough with frustration. "You. Get over here. Now."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1019.html">« Prev</a><a href="1021.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
