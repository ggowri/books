And now? Now you&#x27;re kneeling before me.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I fought against everyone&#x27;s objections for your sake. I convinced my parents to let you run the company on your own because I believed in you. I thought your pride would drive you to great success.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her voice trembled with anger as she continued, &quot;But what did you do? You squandered everything—wasting all the money on your mistress and her daughter. You didn&#x27;t just betray my trust or my sacrifices—you betrayed everything I ever believed in about you.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;And even when the company wasn&#x27;t making a profit, I still stood by you. I made sure you looked successful in front of others, letting you bask in the glory of being chairman. At home, you lived like an emperor—served by maids, cared for by me, adored by our four children who obeyed your every word. For over twenty years, I had your back, supported you, and made sure you never had a single worry.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula&#x27;s voice turned icy. &quot;But today, you&#x27;re finally back where you started.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Back then, you had nothing. I was the one who stood beside you, supporting you through every hardship. Because of me, your family and relatives got to live comfortably. And yet, after everything I did, all you ever wanted was to take it away from me.&quot; She took a step back. &quot;Well, it&#x27;s time for you to go back to where you came from.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jeff&#x27;s expression darkened as anger flared in his eyes. He grabbed Paula&#x27;s wrist, tightening his grip. &quot;Paula, I betrayed you—but don&#x27;t act like you didn&#x27;t betray me too. Tell me, whose daughter is Diana?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula wasn&#x27;t surprised he had found out. That day, when she told Diana the truth, someone had been listening outside the door.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It must have been Queenie&#x27;s people. That was how Jeff knew.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Disgusted, Paula yanked her hand away and wiped it harshly, as if scrubbing off his touch. She let out a cold, mocking laugh.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;When I ran into financial trouble back then, did you help me? No. Instead, you spent your days playing house with Amelie, the mistress you kept on the side. If it weren&#x27;t for Diana&#x27;s father stepping in, you wouldn&#x27;t have had the luxury of the last twenty years.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Jeff, you&#x27;ve spent your entire life living off women, pretending to be something you&#x27;re not. But I&#x27;m done with that. I&#x27;m taking back everything I ever gave you. From this moment on, you have nothing. Just like when you were young, you&#x27;ll be struggling to put food on the table, worrying about how to afford a five-dollar bottle of antibiotics.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula&#x27;s gaze then shifted to Amelie. Seeing her like this—helpless, panicked—was exactly what Paula had been waiting for. &quot;Amelie,&quot; she said with a smirk, &quot;I know you&#x27;re still dreaming of some grand future, but it&#x27;s time to wake up. Queenie&#x27;s project? It&#x27;s fallen apart. She dug right into an ancient tomb—an underground palace, of all things. Every penny she invested is gone, down the drain.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Both Jeff and Amelie froze in shock.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Amelie couldn&#x27;t believe what she was hearing and shook her head in disbelief. &quot;No, I don&#x27;t believe you. You lying bitch! You&#x27;re just trying to trick me. There&#x27;s no way Queenie could fail!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula watched Amelie&#x27;s pained expression, but, to her surprise, she didn&#x27;t feel the slightest bit of sympathy.</p><p style="text-align:left;">If she could go back, she thought, she would never have chosen Jeff. She would have married someone from her circle, someone who could understand her, and they would have built their lives and careers separately, respecting each other from a distance.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Because, in the end, marrying someone from a different world, just to protect their fragile ego—only led to losing herself.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jeff, realizing Paula would never forgive him, understood he had lost for good.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He had lost, utterly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He was once a penniless young man, but for more than twenty years, he had lived a life of luxury. He had been content, but now, in his old age, he couldn&#x27;t accept being reduced to nothing.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Paula,&quot; he spat, voice shaking with fury. &quot;You&#x27;ve reduced me to nothing. Are you happy now? Trampling on my dignity, crushing it under your heel—does that excite you?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">When Paula heard those words, she knew—Jeff had never loved her. He had always loved her money.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A bitter smile twisted on her lips as she fought to keep her anger in check. &quot;Jeff, I&#x27;m not happy. Not at all. I wish I&#x27;d never met you. Starting today, get out of my sight. From this moment forward, whether you live or die has nothing to do with me.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">As for what happened to him afterward—she didn&#x27;t care. That was no longer her problem.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;No, no, no, Paula! We have four sons! You can&#x27;t just stand by and let them watch me fall into ruin without lifting a finger!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The mention of their sons only fueled Paula&#x27;s fury. She snapped, her voice breaking with rage. &quot;Jeff, you were the one who abandoned them! You were the one who ruined them! What kind of father were you? Did you ever once guide them toward anything good? Did you ever take the slightest bit of responsibility for them?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;And now, after losing everything, after being left with nothing, you dare to expect them to take care of you? How shameless can you be?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Do you even remember what happened to them? Gale lost his leg. Frank is missing. Eric was humiliated by Queenie and reduced to being her driver. Dylan is stranded overseas with no way to come home.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Jeff, tell me—do you think you deserve their help?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jeff stood there, speechless, as Paula listed everything he had done to his sons. Each accusation was a knife to the gut, forcing him to confront the damage he had caused.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Regret consumed him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He had been so heartless, so blind. He had cast his sons aside like they were nothing.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Tears streamed down his face as he looked at Paula, his voice trembling with remorse. &quot;Paula, I was manipulated! Queenie and Amelie—they were the ones who pushed me to abandon my sons. They wanted a perfect family, and I... I felt guilty for them. That&#x27;s why I left you. That&#x27;s why I gave up my sons. But I see it now. I was wrong. I know I was wrong! Even a lost soul deserves a second chance. Can&#x27;t you—just this once—give me one more chance?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The thought of having nothing terrified Jeff. To him, a life with nothing was his worst nightmare, the kind of horror that kept him awake at night.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He was used to living big and spending without a second thought. Now, he just wanted to relax and enjoy a comfortable, luxurious old age. But now, with nothing left, the crushing difference between his past and present was pushing him to the brink of a breakdown.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Tears streamed down his face as he pleaded with Paula, his voice choked with desperation. &quot;Paula, let&#x27;s get back together. Let&#x27;s forget about the past. We&#x27;ll live a good life. We&#x27;ll grow old together, with our four children. Please, let&#x27;s make this work!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula saw an opening and seized it. &quot;Jeff, I&#x27;ll forgive you, but only if you tell me one thing. Where is Frank?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She had come to see Jeff today for one reason only—to hear him confess what Queenie had done to Frank.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Amelie, overhearing this, grew furious. &quot;Jeff, don&#x27;t say anything! You know what she&#x27;s after! She&#x27;s just trying to figure out how Frank died. Look at you—you&#x27;re penniless now. But we still have Queenie. If she gets caught, you&#x27;ll have nothing left!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">But Jeff wasn&#x27;t listening to Amelie. All he could think about was getting Paula&#x27;s forgiveness.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He was fired up, his mind racing. If Paula had secretly moved all the assets, she must still have billions. That meant he had a chance to turn things around. Excited, he asked, &quot;Paula... If I tell you the truth, will you take me back?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="1007.html">« Prev</a><a href="1009.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
