She was just playing it slow earlier because she wasn't familiar with the car. Now that she's got a feel for it, that thing's flying like a rocket!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A man shouted excitedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The stunning red sports car shot past the blue one on the inside of the tenth turn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone's eyes nearly popped out of their heads at the sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was stunned! Diana could actually drift!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He felt ashamed of his earlier doubts and angry at himself for continuing to underestimate her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric was the most shocked of all. He'd written Diana off as useless, but skills like these weren't developed overnight. He'd been training since he was twelve and still hadn't achieved this level of expertise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man standing next to Eric asked in amazement. "Eric, are you messing with us? You said your sister was worthless, but what's this all about? Even championship racers can't match these driving skills."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric was equally shocked, his voice trembling. "I... I had no idea. I've never seen her drive before, never seen her race."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wondered if that was really Diana in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With skills and endurance like this, Diana could compete in world-class endurance championships.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Those races lasted anywhere from 6 to 24 hours, testing not just technical skills but endurance and vehicle control.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's mastery of racing had somehow surpassed his own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric couldn't believe it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And he refused to accept that Diana was better than him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elroy was stunned. The red sports car he'd dismissed earlier had not only caught up but disappeared from his sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His car was top-of-the-line, while Diana's was the lowest-spec model on the track.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana had already crossed the finish line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And Elroy was a full minute and thirty seconds behind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone was shocked by this situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their earlier trash talk came back to bite them, leaving their faces burning with embarrassment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After her victory, Diana drove the car back to its original spot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After parking and stepping out, Elroy emerged from his driver's seat with a dark expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He still felt like he was dreaming! He'd lost!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet somehow, he had to admit she'd beaten him fair and square.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at Diana, his eyes blazing with intensity. "Diana, since when were you such a monster behind the wheel?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana replied coolly, "I'm nothing special. It's just that my third brother happens to be the world racing champion. That's where I picked up my skills."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric furrowed his brow. "Since when did I become the champion of the World Racing Championship?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elroy glanced at Eric with disbelief. "Him? That loser, the champion of the World Racing Championship?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smirked, not even bothering to look at Eric. "Him? Please. I'm talking about someone else entirely."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric choked on his words, his face turning red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled, "Mr. Morrison, I won. Time to keep your promise."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elroy studied her with interest. With skills like hers on the team, their chances of winning future races would skyrocket.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He extended a sincere invitation. "Ms. Bishop, we can discuss the land matter, but would you be interested in joining our team?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="440.html">« Prev</a><a href="442.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
