"Diana, what... what are you doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana acted as though Queenie didn't even exist, walking right past her without a glance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fuming, Queenie stomped her foot in frustration. "Diana! What's with your attitude?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Diana didn't stop, didn't even hesitate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She simply kept walking, feeling nothing but a wave of bad luck at encountering both Steven and Queenie in such an unexpected place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven, why is Diana here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's new movie had already begun filming, and today's shoot was happening on the island.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven had come here to discuss a business project that Queenie knew about, so she had arranged to meet him. But letting Diana see them leaving the hotel together was just an added bonus. It was sure to make Diana feel uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven, of course, also knew that Paige's team, along with Diana, was staying on the island.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't know. Let's go," Steven said calmly, striding toward the elevator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was already waiting for the elevator when Steven approached. His presence brought with it a strong, imposing aura that made her feel uneasy. Instinctively, she shifted away from him, creating more space between them. She thought, " I need to switch hotels. Running into these two is just too irritating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the island was small, and this was the best hotel. Forget it. I'll just lock the door tonight and avoid seeing them. That'll help."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven noticed her subtle movement and frowned slightly. In a cool tone, he asked, "Did you go out to sea today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked up at him, clearly unimpressed. "What's that got to do with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ignoring her cold demeanor, Steven continued, "I saw you take a speedboat out. Diana, I didn't know you could drive a boat. It surprised me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had arrived on the island just in time to see Diana and Paige heading out to sea. Watching her skillfully maneuver the speedboat had been impressive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was genuinely surprised. Since leaving him, Diana seemed capable of anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her driving skills had already shocked him before. Now, seeing her confidently handling a speedboat, he was left astonished once again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Every new thing she did seemed to amaze him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana remained silent, thinking to herself, "In their eyes, I was always incapable of doing anything. Something as simple as driving a boat can amaze him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he knew all the other things I can do, it would probably knock him off his feet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She briefly mused to herself, wondering how she could be Jeff's daughter. "With his genes, how could he have a daughter as talented as me?" she thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She indulged in her self-praise for a couple of seconds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing her remain silent, Steven suddenly leaned in closer, his intense gaze locking onto hers. "Diana, answer me."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="386.html">« Prev</a><a href="388.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
