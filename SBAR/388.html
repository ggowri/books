"Say what? Aside from the divorce, there's nothing for us to talk about."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's chest tightened. The word "divorce" ignited a fire of anger in his eyes, and he had no intention of divorcing her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My grandparents won't agree to our divorce. They adore you. Have you forgotten how much they care about you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He avoided looking directly at her, knowing this argument was weak, but it was the only one he had left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana realized that once a person no longer cared, they had no vulnerabilities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the past, she had cared deeply about the Marsh family and endured everything. But now, none of it mattered to her anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana had no weaknesses. There was nothing that could threaten her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking of Steven's grandparents, especially Helen, Diana felt a wave of complicated emotions. "I haven't forgotten their kindness. They're them, and you're you. Even after the divorce, I can still visit them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven furrowed his brows but remained silent, staring deeply at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven, why didn't you wait for me? I'm wearing heels and twisted my ankle. It hurts so much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie approached Steven, latching onto Steven's arm in an affectionate manner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven didn't pull away, though he gave her a brief, indifferent glance. "The roads here are rough. Why wear heels? Go back and change, I'll wait for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing that, Diana immediately realized that the two of them were staying in the same room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though she knew they had been involved for a long time, it still hurt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had, after all, genuinely loved Steven once. The pain she felt was only natural.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie smiled gently, her tone soft. "Steven, there's no need. Once we get to the filming location, I'll change. My manager brought plenty of shoes." As she said this, she glanced at Diana, gauging her reaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Diana remained utterly indifferent, her expression as cold as if they were complete strangers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana has really changed. She really doesn't care about Steven anymore," Queenie thought to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ignoring their display of affection, Diana stepped into the elevator as soon as it arrived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie, still holding Steven's hand, quickly followed her into the elevator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A flash of malice crossed Queenie's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, she let out a dramatic cry, "Oh!" Pretending to lose her balance, she fell into Steven's arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven frowned but held her gently, saying softly, "Be careful, don't hurt yourself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes were fixed on Diana. What he saw took him by surprise. Her lips curved in a radiant smile, as warm and bright as the sun after winter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was looking down at her phone, and the smile on her face was one of pure happiness, like that of someone in love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie noticed it, too. Diana wasn't hiding her beauty anymore, and Queenie felt a surge of jealousy. Taking advantage of the moment, she remarked, "Steven, look at Diana's expression. She seems like she's in love, smiling so happily. I wonder which handsome guy is making her so happy on the other end of her phone?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was suggesting Diana was chatting with another man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana had just finished responding to Joseph's message about his grandmother's improving condition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing Queenie's remark, she raised her head sharply. Without hesitation, she swung her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A harsh slap landed on Queenie's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's eyes widened in shock as she held her cheek, utterly stunned. "Diana, you slapped me!"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="387.html">« Prev</a><a href="389.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
