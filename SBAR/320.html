"No way. There's no way I'm getting trashed online."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she recalled her recent words and actions, the blood drained from her lips. Her whole body shook, and her eyes betrayed uncontrollable fear.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That damned little bitch, Diana! How dare she set me up on live stream!" she cursed inwardly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Luna, do you know what I excel at?" Queenie groaned, struggling to sit up despite the sharp pain that wracked her body. She propped herself against the wall, her insides still churning.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna let out a sarcastic laugh. "Oh, you're good at plenty of things, aren't you? Slipping drugs, photoshopping pictures to frame Diana, and one more thing you excel at..." Luna paused for effect, her voice dripping with irony. "Seducing men.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And the reason Diana is going against you is simple. She has a lot of dirt on you. Every time you try to expose her online, she'll retaliate in kind. What you experienced today is just a taste of what she can do. Your movie's tanked unless Jace goes out of his way to save you. And to save you, he might have to throw himself under the bus. But knowing how shameless you are, you'll definitely sacrifice him to protect your reputation. Now, get to work.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Better hurry while you're still trending. Use this controversy to keep yourself in the spotlight."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No!" Queenie wailed, ultimately breaking down at Luna's words.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wasn't one to crumble easily.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now her mind was blank, buzzing like a swarm of mosquitoes attacking her thoughts, making her restless. Diana had just shattered her carefully crafted image.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna watched Queenie's distress with satisfaction.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie, Diana said she'd strip away your mask layer by layer until you're ruined," Luna declared before heading into the office.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Queenie's assistant rushed over.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Marsh, we've got trouble. Mr. Gellar's furious about what happened during your livestream. He's pulled his investment," she reported anxiously.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And there is no word from Jace yet."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie swayed, her legs almost giving way.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven had withdrawn his support.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man who'd treated her like gold had been the first to stab her in the back!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie closed her eyes, then opened them again, her gaze clear and steady. "Let's go find Steven."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was still on the road. She'd watched the entire livestream, responding only with a smile.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Dealing with Queenie and her suicidal theatrics wouldn't be that difficult after all.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana hummed a cheerful tune as she drove to Rihull Island.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank had also caught the livestream. As he witnessed Queenie's ugly side, he was stunned into silence.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She'd deliberately driven Diana away.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank stared at the screen, unable to process what he'd seen. Finally, tears welled up in his eyes as realization hit him! Queenie wanted Diana to lose everything with no chance of recovery!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it weren't for what happened with Jeff, Frank might not have cared.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, he felt Diana's helplessness and Queenie's venom acutely.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So this is Queenie's true colors when no one's watching?" he muttered.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank's grip on his phone tightened as waves of dizziness washed over him.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="319.html">« Prev</a><a href="321.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
