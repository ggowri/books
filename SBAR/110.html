How rude it is to intrude into other's room!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven had never touched her even after they got married.Let alone entered her room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was only after half a year when he was drunk, he slept with her and led to her pregnancy. A year later, Diana was killed by accident with her unborn child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In this life, she wouldn't harm that baby again, the one who had no chance to come into this world in her previous life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As long as she divorced this man, her baby would be safe and sound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As long as she divorced this man...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven sat down coldly on a nearby chair and explained, "Because this is the property of the Gellar family, and I am your husband."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Humph...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You jerk!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Even so, you can't enter a guest's room at will. If it were someone else, you'd probably be at the police station by now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ignoring Steven's expression, she rubbed her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven stared at her panicked appearance. How come he didn't notice she was this cute before?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cute and spirited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was the first time he saw Diana wake up. She was very adorable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At home, she was always dressed very properly each time he saw her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now, she didn&rsquo;t need to get up at six to make him breakfast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula was right. Diana indeed did a lot for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In contrast, Queenie got his love without doing anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie grew up with him and saved him from that big fire. So he felt grateful to Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Before Diana appeared, Queenie was his nominal fianc&eacute;e.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But was it really Queenie who saved him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The answer was yet to be investigated...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven didn't answer Diana&rsquo;s accusation. He came here to ask her something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana also thought about the divorce today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was at a loss for words. Her hand resting on the blanket was badly bruised due to the pinching earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven stared at her, thinking, "Didn't expect her to be this silly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Why did she pinch herself that hard?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana shouted angrily, "I've already agreed to the divorce and signed the papers. I won't go back on my word. No need for you to be here early in the morning to drag me to the Civil Affair Bureau."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She threw off the covers to get out of bed. "I&rsquo;m going to get changed. Just a moment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana hadn't slept enough and yawned as she walked. It must be after eight now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They could still make it back in time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alas!!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was Steven who had been so eager to divorce, but now he actually refused to complete the final procedures.Damn him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana went to the bathroom to wash up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven sat straight in the chair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He hadn't slept all night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula's words echoed loudly in his ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He wasn't blind to what Diana had done for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It's just that Diana had always been at odds with Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven looked out the window with a frown. The sea was azure. His eyes were unfathomable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana came out changed in just over ten minutes. Steven was still gazing out the window, his profile devastatingly handsome.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Admittedly, Steven was very handsome, with an outstanding aura. Any woman who saw him would be deeply attracted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That seventeen-year-old Diana fell deeply in love with him all because of that gorgeous face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She felt an inexplicable sadness in her heart. For this man, she had been willing to do anything. Because when she loved him, she loved him with all her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm ready. Let's go get our divorce certificate," she called out in a calm tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven came back to his senses and looked at her calm eyes. He stood up suddenly, with an inexplicable anger in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was stunned and felt his anger!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The raging fire seemed to devour her. And she took a step back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven sneered, "What? After you poisoned my mother, you want to divorce me and get rid of me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was stunned and suddenly understood his words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In fact, his mother...</p><div class="pagination"><a href="109.html">« Prev</a><a href="111.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
