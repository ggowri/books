Your lover is still at the police station."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the same time, Evan was glad that Steven was no longer orbiting around Queenie.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He took a deep breath. If he tried to find evidence now, he probably wouldn't get anything.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana couldn't reach Luna on the phone, so she checked her location. It was moving toward the outskirts of the city.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She realized that Luna was in trouble and needed to save her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana had just started the car when suddenly the passenger door was pulled open, and Steven's tall figure sat down in the passenger seat.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana frowned, stopped the car, and looked at Steven, her voice icy. "Get out."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven observed her cold gaze, which was rare to see. "I'll go with you."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked tense, clearly something had happened.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked at him mockingly. His presence was unexpected. "Shouldn't you be with your lover? Aren't you afraid she'll be in trouble?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the past, whenever Queenie was upset, Steven would rush to her side, afraid something might happen to her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven smiled and asked, "Diana, do you care if I go to her?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shook her head, finding his question absurd. Hadn't it always been this way before?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't care. Why should I? Since the day you gave me the divorce papers at her birthday party, I've stopped caring. You two trash should stay locked together. Why do you keep bothering me? Get out!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, can't you speak a little less harshly..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I spoke any nicer or humbler, you people would've bullied me until I had nothing left but bones. I'm telling you to get out. This is my car."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She would never again beg for this man's attention.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Never again.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Right now, she was worried about Luna. She had already asked Nolan to call the police and send people over. There was no time to waste.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was stubborn and wouldn't get out, so she had no choice but to drive off in pursuit of Luna.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her speed was fast, and her driving was smooth.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For the first time, Steven realized that Diana not only could drive but drove exceptionally well.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her car had excellent performance and accelerated rapidly. Once on the road, she changed lanes and sped up with seamless precision.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She resembled a professional racer.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven watched her precise driving, noting how well she estimated distances.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was slightly surprised. "Diana, are you really this good at driving?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's smile was cold. For some reason, his words still stung her heart. "Mr. Gellar, am I really that incompetent in your eyes?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, in his eyes, she was just a country girl.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aside from cooking, she seemed capable of nothing else.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But back then, when his legs were paralyzed, she had to care for him. At 20, she was also studying for her graduate exams, using his sleeping or working hours to study diligently.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Every day was both busy and exhausting.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had quietly passed her graduate exams right under his nose, and he hadn't noticed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now she finally understood that Steven didn't love her, so how could she blame him?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Blame him for not loving her?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was it because of his lack of love that he trampled her so easily?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The truth was, he loved Queenie. After Queenie returned, all he had to do was divorce Diana, and she wouldn't have clung to the title of Mrs. Gellar. Yet, he chose to humiliate her instead.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana noticed many trucks ahead and cleared her mind of distractions, focusing on driving.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she reached a traffic jam, she immediately tried to call Luna.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Luna's phone was still unreachable.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was anxious. Luna was stubborn and prone to fighting at the slightest provocation. She feared Luna might be hurt. The GPS on her dashboard showed that Luna had moved further outside the city. The large screen in her car displayed all the routes clearly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna had arrived at the banquet venue earlier than Diana, but she had been spotted.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana, worried, called Nolan.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Have the police been dispatched? Luna's location is already outside the city."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="337.html">« Prev</a><a href="339.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
