There's a branch of the Farley family. This branch has started having issues, which is why he went there. Diana, I can't trust anyone from the Farley family. I only trust you. Please help me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana felt a pang in her heart. That was the life in a prominent family. If there was not a single reliable person, life could be really tough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Money could solve almost everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, some played both sides, taking money from both parties and acting as a mediator, which would lead to nothing getting done.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Such situations were all too common.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Alright, I understand. Madam Farley, I'll go there myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana hung up the phone and messaged Luna.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">[Luna, you previously had someone watching Cecil. Did you manage to get any footage?]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna: [Diana, I was just about to tell you about Cecil's situation. I'm sending you a video.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana quickly received the video. With just one glance, her expression darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana called Luna directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna answered, "Diana."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Luna, assign someone else to keep an eye on Queenie. You come with me to Woodston to get Cecil out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna said, "Sure thing!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After hanging up, Diana prepared to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Remembering she had an appointment with Alexander, she called him, explaining she had an urgent business trip and would treat him to a meal when she returned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alexander even kindly asked if she needed his help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana replied with a smile: [Thanks! I'll let you know if I need anything.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She thought Alexander would make a great boyfriend, always caring for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">To be successful, she needed the help of a benefactor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alexander was destined to be her future benefactor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was a two-hour flight to Woodston, and tickets were always available.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana packed up and went downstairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna, waiting downstairs, had already arranged a car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At the same time, Steven had also received the news and brought Evan to handle it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His business in Woodston was significant to him. Since someone dared to do such a thing in his bar, he naturally wouldn't let it slide.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At 4 PM, Diana and Luna arrived in Woodston.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They went straight to the police station and met Steven at the entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven looked into Diana's eyes, his gaze deep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He saw through her purpose for being here in an instant&mdash;to save Cecil.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven frowned, and the pressure of a leader was instantly released.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana felt the pressure mount.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven took a step forward, his voice deep and sexy. "Here to save Cecil?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana didn't speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's eyes grew colder. "Speak."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana nodded frankly. "Yes. Cecil was framed in your bar. I suspect it was you and Queenie behind it. After all, you two are still holding a grudge over the last banquet. So, here I am. You can take out your grievances on me. Don't hurt the innocent."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's deep eyes darkened immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">So that was what she thought of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, is that what I am in your heart?" Steven looked at her with complex eyes, his tone carrying anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing Steven angry, Diana smiled brightly, "Yes. You and the Marsh family have always been cut from the same cloth. Everything you've done is so despicable and shameless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Steven, you conspired with them to frame me and condoned Queenie hurting me. What gives you the right to ask me that today?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You never believed in me. What you've done also makes it impossible for me to believe in you. We've already signed the divorce agreement. You're overstepping."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="175.html">« Prev</a><a href="177.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
