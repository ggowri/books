Just when she thought Steven was going to let her off, he ordered, "Go to the beach outside the city and throw her into the sea to feed the fish."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's eyes suddenly widened in disbelief, and she shouted at the top of her lungs, "What? Steven, why are you going to kill me? It is against the law!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven sat in the driver's seat with his tall figure and then said, "You decided to kill Evan without realizing that killing someone was against the law."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was dumbfounded. Mario had already sent her a message about Evan, but she absolutely could not admit it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, the relationship between her and Steven would be completely severed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was trembling from the cold. "Steven, I don't know what you are talking about. How could I harm Evan? Did you make a mistake?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"D-Did Diana frame me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven laughed in anger, "What does it have to do with her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie narrowed her eyes. She was used to putting the blame on Diana. However, Steven was unwilling to buy her story now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his indifferent and ruthless methods, he would definitely throw her into the sea without anyone noticing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, she couldn't die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, I understand you are very anxious because Evan is in trouble, but you can't blame me for it. Why should I murder him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a dark face, Steven turned the steering wheel smoothly and left the underground garage. "Because he heard some secrets."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was indeed the case. Damn it, Evan actually left evidence for Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie quickly shook her head and retorted, "Steven, it's not like that. It's none of my business. Please let me go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter what she said, Steven ignored her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the ambulance was stuck in the middle of the road just after passing the red light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a car accident up ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the distinctive sound of the ambulance continued, no one was able to move the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All three lanes were blocked, and the ambulance was stuck in the middle, unable to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was heating in the ambulance, so it was not that freezing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige's body was gradually warming up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A doctor glanced at Diana and comforted her. "Miss, don't worry. Your friend's temperature has risen, and she is not in danger. Your previous emergency first aid saved her life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that Paige was not dying now, but her frostbitten skin needed treatment as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige's hands were red and cold, and they didn't get better even as her temperature gradually rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you." Diana calmed herself down. When she recalled what had happened today, her eyes were chilly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a man shouted worriedly, "Move the car! There is a pregnant woman in critical condition in my car! Please move the car right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stamped his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The honking of car horns added to the annoyance of people stuck in traffic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone yelled, "Stop honking. There's an accident ahead. They're dealing with it. It's too noisy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana heard the noise outside. Learning that there was a pregnant woman who was about to give birth, she was anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The site of the accident was not far from them. She looked through the car window and saw the two car owners fighting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana frowned. Instead of solving the problem, they started a fight, affecting traffic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at Paige, who was lying flat on her back. Her face gradually turned rosy, but Diana was still apprehensive about Paige's frostbitten skin. She had medical skills, but without medicine, she could do nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man who had just spoken roared loudly, "Is there a doctor? Is there a doctor? My wife is about to give birth. Please save my wife..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't snow today, but it was still freezing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His urgent voice sounded helpless in the cold wind.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="856.html">« Prev</a><a href="858.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
