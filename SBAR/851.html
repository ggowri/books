It was lunchtime, and he was the only one on duty, so he took the bribe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven grabbed his collar tightly and glared at him. "You'd better tell me the truth honestly. Otherwise, I will make sure you stay in jail for the rest of your life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"J-Jail. I can't go to jail. My mother is old. I really have no idea who he is. He gave me 50 thousand dollars and asked me to delete a video. I don't know what happened after that or how to operate the surveillance system. I'm just on duty here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My responsibility is to watch out for thieves or troublemakers. I am indeed unaware of his identity," the man stuttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furious, Steven punched him hard in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man let out a scream and then fell to the floor, unable to move in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven glanced back at Diana. "Diana, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of the way." She stepped over quickly and sat in front of the computer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her fingers fluttered swiftly across the keyboard like the nimble wings of a butterfly.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was stunned that she actually had such knowledge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but smile. She went to study abroad and skipped grades to finish college before 17. It was he who underestimated her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How many surprises were waiting for him to discover about his wife?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, his deep eyes revealed a strong expectation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two minutes later, Diana successfully restored the deleted video, which showed Paige talking on her cell phone in the doorway.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, she was about to turn around and go in when suddenly two men appeared behind her with white handkerchiefs in their hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They quickly covered her mouth and nose, and she soon fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them lifted her feet, and they carried her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana flew into a rage. How bold they were to kidnap Paige in such a place!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven spotted the scene, too. He never expected that someone would dare to kidnap Paige here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stared at the two men and felt vaguely familiar with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It suddenly occurred to her that when leaving backstage and approaching the door, she met them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She even took a glance at them at that time. It was exactly them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Where did they take Paige?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana immediately reviewed the surveillance footage of the entire hotel, and the bad premonition in her heart grew stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her delicate face was tense, and her cheeks slightly puffed up. Her eyes were as deep as if a violent storm was hidden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, as the video continued, the two men headed towards the basement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana quickly saved the video, stood up abruptly, and rushed towards the basement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven followed closely behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, she called Luna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Luna, take someone to the basement. Paige has been taken away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna replied, "Okay, Diana, I'll be right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana hung up and ran faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven chased after her all the time, looking at her anxious back. She had always been so attentive to her friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson suddenly appeared and blocked Steven's way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned at him and growled, "Get out of my way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yanson shook his head and said, "Steven, listen to me. What happened today is my fault..."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="850.html">« Prev</a><a href="852.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
