Why were the photos deleted?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Damn it, it didn't feel good to be wrongly accused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Who the hell had touched his phone?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale finally concluded that he might have deleted the photos accidentally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What a pity! Those designs were really incredible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why did they suddenly belong to Steven's company?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale was stunned, remembering the abduction Queenie had orchestrated at the banquet to get Diana beaten up by Steven and Jeff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, she was vicious and deserved the beating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was not Queenie's fault.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale continued to check his car irritably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the car, Diana closed her eyes sadly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna drove back. She couldn't help but glance at Diana and said angrily, "Diana, don't be sad. These are just some design drawings. Diana, your inspiration is endless. There will be better designs next time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana took a deep breath. She didn't want to be depressed, but her heart ached uncontrollably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, I can't let it go like this. Let's go to find Emma. I must beat her up today." In her rage, Diana was determined to teach Emma a lesson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna grew furious. "Okay!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Half an hour later, the car stopped downstairs at the Gellar Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna said slowly, "Diana, we're here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana opened her beautiful eyes. "Wait for me here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna was worried about her. "Diana, I will go up with you. If you are in danger, I can protect you. Otherwise, Mr. Tobias Bishop will scold me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled, "Silly girl, can't I fight? Am I easy to bully?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, but you don't have to do it yourself. Leave it to me." Luna unbuckled her seat belt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her small face was icy, and her eyes were starry. She appeared even more aloof in the sunshine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she insisted, Diana smiled and, without a retort, led her in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They entered the lobby but were stopped by a receptionist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana rarely showed up at Steven's company. He said, "Don't go to the company unless it's necessary. I'm afraid that others will misunderstand our relationship, which might upset Queenie."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After that, she never came again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was her first time visiting his company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Madam, do you have an appointment?" the receptionist asked politely, but her eyes on Diana were weird.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She glanced at the receptionist. "I'm here to meet Steven."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The receptionist sized Diana up with disdain. "I am sorry. You can't meet Mr. Gellar without an appointment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her bad attitude annoyed Diana. "Well, give him a call and tell him that Diana wants to meet him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I am sorry. As you have no appointment, I cannot call him. If you want to meet Mr. Gellar, please make an appointment first." The receptionist's arrogant gaze and her rude tone made Diana very uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana clenched her fists, and Luna's patience ran out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She stopped Luna, who was about to lose her temper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't fight. I'll call Steven."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey! You actually have Mr. Gellar's phone number. How dare you demand to see him? Get out of here, and don't disturb him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana said nothing and endured it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, she pulled out her phone and called Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His number was still on the blacklist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She unblocked it and called him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The receptionist frowned and stared at the stunning Diana coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Security, come and get these two troublemaking women out of here right away."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="213.html">« Prev</a><a href="215.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
