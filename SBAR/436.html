"Diana, you're as easy to manipulate as ever. Come over and take care of Mr. Morrison, so I can get back. The address is at the racetrack outside town. I'll send it to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana declined, saying, "No need. I know that place. And you should just keep dreaming, Mr. Marsh. Dreams have everything you wish for."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, she hung up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew Mr. Morrison liked to take chances and owned a plot of land.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her previous life, the land was bought by the people behind Queenie. It became the center of attention after a resort developed there turned into a hot spot due to a newly discovered hot spring, raking in millions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The land had made Queenie and the person's wealth grow. She recalled that he was a racer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had seen him before, so she would go over and take a look. If this was indeed Mr. Morrison, she could take a chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana headed to the garage and drove out in a sports car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Steven got into the car, he noticed the gates of Diana's villa slowly opening. He saw her emerge in a red sports car and frowned. Where was she headed at this hour?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He followed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After forty minutes, they arrived at the racetrack outside town.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale Marsh and Eric Marsh loved racing. Eric preferred motorcycles, but Eric's skills didn't match Gale's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they reached the destination, Diana parked outside and walked in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She spotted lights flickering in the distance, surrounded by heaps of tires.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric was tied up, hanging from the tires, his face bruised and bloodied, with scratches on his nose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite being from the talented Marsh family, he resembled his mother, Paula, in looks but lacked Jeff's traits.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Several cars lined the track, and a group of six men dressed in edgy street style loitered nearby, their dyed hair and baggy pants swaying in the chilly wind, gold chains clanking noisily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, you finally come here! Why so late? It's freezing out here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric was shivering from the cold and glared at Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana simply gave him a brief glance before her eyes settled on a handsome young man lounging on a chair nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was relaxed, his legs crossed, and exuded an effortless charisma as he watched her with interest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She studied him closely&mdash;it was indeed that person.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="435.html">« Prev</a><a href="437.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
