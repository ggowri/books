Her hands trembled slightly, and her eyes glistened with unshed tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We failed. The car plunged into the river, that man was caught, and Diana walked away unscathed. She always gets this lucky."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Useless!" George snapped, his voice brimming with contempt. "How is it that Diana escapes every single time? What's so special about her? You've plotted against her at least a hundred times now, haven't you? And yet, not once has it worked. But the moment you target Steven, it works on the first try! What is this? Are you saying Diana's more capable than Steven?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His frustration ran deep, leaving a sour taste in his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie closed her eyes, exhaustion washing over her. She didn't understand it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her dreams, everything always went so smoothly. Diana would suffer unimaginable pain, and in the end, she'd die a tragic, miserable death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But in reality...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">George, oddly enough, wasn't too enraged. Instead, a spark of determination lit his gaze. He thought to himself that once he recovered, he would personally take action, and he felt it wouldn't be hard to torment someone. "Don't worry. Next time, I'll handle her myself. She won't escape again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Queenie's stomach churned violently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her heart sank. A wave of discomfort swept over her, and she realized with growing horror that this was the precursor to diarrhea. The food they'd just eaten might not have been clean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A sharp pain gripped her abdomen. She turned to George, about to say something when an absurd scene unfolded before her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">George, still seated on the hospital bed, suddenly let out a rapid string of loud, echoing farts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His face froze in disbelief as his eyes widened in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, he wished he could disappear into thin air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The air grew thick with a pungent, unbearable stench.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie stared at him in stunned silence, her expression mirroring his horror. But before she could mock him, her own stomach betrayed her. She doubled over as an uncontrollable symphony of equally rancid noises escaped her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Aah!" she screamed, clutching her abdomen. She wheeled herself frantically toward the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But sitting in a wheelchair, she couldn't compete with the able-bodied George.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">George, unhindered by a wheelchair, jumped off the bed and dashed ahead of her, slamming the bathroom door shut behind him. The foul odor lingered in the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie sat frozen, staring at the closed door with disbelief. She hadn't expected George to abandon her like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then it happened. She lost control, right there in her wheelchair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No... no! No!" she screamed in despair, humiliated beyond words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The stench became overpowering. The entire room reeked, and the sight around her was unbearable. She never imagined something so grotesque could happen to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her stomach had been acting up lately, but she hadn't expected that one meal of takeout could lead to this nightmare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Deep down, she knew the truth. They'd been drugged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie broke down, sobbing uncontrollably. Her eyes were bloodshot, her face pale as she clenched her trembling fists.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She glanced at the mess around her, on the floor, and felt the last remnants of her dignity slip away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Outside the room, Evan was doubled over in laughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't hold it in any longer. He laughed so hard that tears streamed down his face as he walked away. Even after reaching the hospital's entrance, his laughter didn't stop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was the most satisfying revenge he'd ever had. Queenie had insulted him before, and now, in one move, he'd evened the score.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He sent a video of the scene to Steven, thinking it might amuse him too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Steven was reviewing surveillance footage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana and Luna had already made it home safely, but Diana didn't look too pleased.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna sat on the couch, recounting the night's events to Nolan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nolan, do you know what Diana and I went through tonight? We almost drowned in the river!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her voice shook with anger. She couldn't believe how cruel their enemies were.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nolan frowned. "Luna, I should've gone with you tonight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna shook her head. "And what would you have done? If you'd come with us, would you have been able to stop the car crash?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nolan fell silent, knowing she was right. Seeing them safe now was enough for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Luna," he said gently, "from now on, make sure Nick and Barry go with you whenever you leave the house."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna nodded. She understood the gravity of the situation. Queenie's madness was escalating, and it was better to be cautious than risk another disaster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana glanced at Luna. "It's over. Go get some sleep. I'm tired."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She stood up, limping slightly as she made her way upstairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna, still fuming, turned to Nolan. "I'm sure this was Queenie's doing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She felt that besides Queenie, no one else would do such a thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nolan narrowed his eyes, his gaze fixed on Luna's pale, determined face. He smiled faintly, trying to comfort her. "Don't worry, Luna. This will all be over soon. We're just waiting for the right moment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana had been working on her plan for nearly a year. Now that the key player had finally appeared, the days of tolerating Queenie's antics were coming to an end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna knew this too. She stood up, saying, "Goodnight. You three should get some rest as well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upstairs, Diana finished her nighttime routine and lay down in bed. Her neck still ached.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her face, cold and stunning, was framed by long lashes that trembled lightly. Her eyes burned with anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It must've been Queenie," she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She rubbed the back of her head, her thoughts drifting to January 8.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once the truth was revealed, she'd orchestrate the perfect scenario to bring Steven back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She smirked to herself. "That pathetic man deserves everything coming his way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the more she thought about it, the angrier she got. Sleep refused to come.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She picked up her phone and sent a message to Olivia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Olivia's business had been booming lately. Many sought her out for fortune-telling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Currently, she was abroad, having accompanied her grandmother on a trip while taking on a lucrative client.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana: [Olivia, tonight was dangerous. I almost died.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her past life, Diana had sacrificed everything for Steven, only to end up abandoned and despised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Olivia had eventually left, choosing her own path.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Olivia: [Diana, why does danger always find you when I'm not around? But don't worry. I've read your fortune. Your life may be full of trials, but the ending will be perfect. Truly perfect.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana trusted Olivia. She never sugarcoated the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana: [What kind of "perfect"? To me, perfection is a loving family, parents, a spouse, and children. That's a true happy ending.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Olivia: [Believe me or not, your luck is turning for the better. Even your soulmate is getting closer.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana chuckled. [Are you just trying to cheer me up?]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her friend's words warmed her heart, and her eyes sparkled like stars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, she radiated a dazzling vitality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Olivia: [No, Diana, I'm serious. If anything, I envy you. I envy you so much.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana frowned. She didn't understand. Her life had been full of suffering, so she didn't know what there was to envy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana: [Olivia, what do you envy about me?]</p><div class="pagination"><a href="975.html">« Prev</a><a href="977.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
