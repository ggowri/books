Everything that comes out of your mouth is filth."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana cut her off with a cold laugh, her eyes flashing with anger. "Being a mistress is bad enough, but you're also constantly trying to frame me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You parade around with Steven like a couple, which is all the proof anyone needs of your affair. When your movie premieres, I'll make sure to expose you both. I'll release those photos you sent me from your little bedroom adventures and show the world my marriage certificate with Steven. Queenie, you'll be condemned to hell for the rest of your life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Moreover, you're so shameless that no matter how I hit you, you won't feel any shame.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I ever hear you slandering me again, I'll make sure those pretty white teeth of yours disappear forever."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was furious, stomping her feet in rage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, you've lost your mind!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's right, I have. If I hadn't, you and that cheating bastard would've destroyed me, leaving nothing but bones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie, let me warn you. For every time you plot against me, I'll hit you back. I'm not living for anything else now. Just to drag you both down to hell."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With those words, the elevator doors opened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana strode out with confidence, her steps exuding an air of defiance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven quickly followed her, blocking her path with a stern presence. "Diana, where do you think you're going?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana frowned, irritated by his persistence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven, you're really annoying. Can you please leave me alone?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing the frustration in her eyes, Steven finally realized Diana truly no longer loved him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're my wife. I have a right to know where you're going."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana let out a bitter laugh, feeling suffocated by his controlling demeanor. With a sarcastic edge, she replied, "Steven, did you forget you had a wife when you were spending five million dollars a month on your mistress?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Queenie strolled up with a smug smile. "Diana, that money was given to me willingly by Steven. I saved his life, and I'm the one he truly loves. If he doesn't spend his money on me, who else would he spend it on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her tone was full of arrogance as she provocatively looked at Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Disgusted by Queenie's shamelessness, Diana felt a wave of nausea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie, by all means, enjoy the money. Once two years have passed, I'll file for divorce, and I'll claim every penny he's given you. Steven may spoil you now, but guess what? I have a legal marriage certificate, and that's something you can't beat."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's radiant smile lit up her face as she spoke, clearly enjoying herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Turning to Steven, she added with a smirk, "Mr. Gellar, keep spoiling her. I'll take it all back soon enough."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Diana left with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's face twisted with venomous hatred. "Diana, if I kill you here, they'll never find your body," she thought to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was too focused on Diana's retreating figure to notice the murderous glint in Queenie's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After leaving the hotel, Diana headed straight to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie, meanwhile, sent a message to Mario, instructing him to keep an eye on Diana. She then asked Steven to drive her to the film set.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Diana arrived at the hospital, Paige was still waiting outside the emergency room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Diana could say anything, the door to the emergency room opened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was wheeled out, lying motionless on the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige immediately approached the attending doctor. "Doctor, how is he? Did his leg get ruined?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The doctor was briefly taken aback by her bluntness but quickly responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, his leg isn't ruined. After surgery, he won't be able to do any heavy work for at least six months. However, he won't be able to run or jump for the rest of his life. It will all depend on his recovery."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige hesitated, then asked cautiously, "So... will he die?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="388.html">« Prev</a><a href="390.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
