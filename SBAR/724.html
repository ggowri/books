After a barbeque lunch, Diana changed into comfy clothes and started tidying up.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven wasn't keen on having strangers around, so the housekeeper only came in twice a week.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She used to prepare Steven's clothes, but now she wondered who was doing that for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd been living here for several days and hadn't seen any household staff or personal assistant, which meant only one possibility - Evan must be helping him with his clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tied her hair up in a messy bun and started cleaning, figuring it would help burn off some calories.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd gone a little overboard with the barbeque at lunch and needed to work off all that meat. Her stomach felt like it was about to burst.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't been up to the third floor yet, and since she didn't live up there, she hadn't cleaned it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, she tackled her room and reorganized her closet. Then, she moved on to the study.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's study was pretty simple: a bookcase on the right, a sofa in the middle, and a desk by the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The office was bare, which matched his personality perfectly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing the study, she went to clean Steven's room, pushing open the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything inside was still impeccable and organized.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was actually quite handy around the house and preferred to keep his room off-limits to the servants, maintaining it himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After mopping the floor, she went into the walk-in closet, where she found a pile of dirty laundry.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Steven's unwashed clothes from the past couple of days.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Geez..." Diana put her hands on her hips, sweating from cleaning the whole place.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Steven's pile of dirty clothes, she sighed, debating whether to do his laundry.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's not hiring a housekeeper, he just wants me to wait on him hand and foot like before, doesn't he?" she muttered to herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana took a deep breath. Tobias was abroad, and if she upset Steven, his project might be put on hold.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wry smile touched her lips. Even though she was reborn and knew how things would unfold, there were still things she couldn't change. All she could really control was her own life.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power gap was too broad, and she couldn't fight against Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was deliberately keeping her under his thumb, but she had no choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Tobias' project was finished and Queenie's situation was resolved, she'd leave this place and never look back.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This thought brought Diana some comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She picked up Steven's dirty clothes and headed to the laundry room.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The laundry room was spacious. After changing into slippers, she turned on the hot water and started hand-washing his shirts.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she spotted a pair of boxers. It brought to mind a scene from a novel where the female protagonist, despite feeling down, still had to wash her husband's underwear.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn't help but roll her eyes. She used to do that too, happily washing Steven's underwear when they were married. Back then, it felt perfectly natural to take care of his laundry.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now she didn't want to anymore. She tossed the underwear aside, knowing Steven would get the message.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hours later, her stomach felt much better, and the laundry was done. After drying the clothes and ironing them carefully, she returned them to Steven's closet before heading off to work on her designs.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She settled down in the well-lit room to focus on her design sketches.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gazing at the bare bedroom, she felt like something was missing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then it hit her, and the room needed some life.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pulled out her phone, opened a delivery app, and ordered two bouquets of roses along with a beautiful crystal vase.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, her order arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crouching in the snowy yard, she arranged the roses perfectly in the vase. Feeling cheerful, she carried it upstairs, filled it with water in the bathroom, and admired how the roses seemed to glow with vitality.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She placed the vase on her desk where she could see it with just a glance upward, knowing it would keep her spirits high.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="723.html">« Prev</a><a href="725.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
