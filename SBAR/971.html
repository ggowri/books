Hadn&#x27;t they both been given a new life?</p><p>They were both alive and well. In their past lives, they were already gone.</p><p>Now, it was up to Queenie.</p><p>If Queenie had memories of her past life, they were all in danger. But fate had already been kind to Diana.</p><p>No matter what dangers lay ahead, she would face them without fear.</p><p>Everything fate had given her, she could handle.</p><p>Diana&#x27;s smile was sweet, radiating confidence. &quot;Things might get tougher from here on out. You two need to be extra careful—especially when you&#x27;re out driving. Watch your backs.&quot;</p><p>She wasn&#x27;t just talking nonsense. If Queenie did have memories from her past life, she&#x27;d remember just how many people she&#x27;d killed, and how cleanly she&#x27;d gotten away with it—no trace left for the police to find.</p><p>She knew how to cover her tracks, and the people who helped her made sure no one would expose her. Just like Felicity, who kept Diana&#x27;s secret while quietly serving her time.</p><p>Maybe Queenie was the universe&#x27;s chosen one.</p><p>It was only because Diana had known what was coming that she&#x27;d been able to stop Queenie before.</p><p>But she wouldn&#x27;t always be this lucky. Queenie&#x27;s good fortune seemed to be catching up with her.</p><p>Cecil scoffed, a bitter smile curling on his lips. &quot;She&#x27;s going to throw us some curveballs, but so what? Do you think we can&#x27;t handle it? Diana, don&#x27;t worry, we&#x27;ve got your back.&quot;</p><p>Diana&#x27;s smile softened, warmth radiating from her as she met his confident grin and lazy gaze. She knew Cecil had truly grown up. &quot;Alright.&quot;</p><p>Rita&#x27;s eyes sparkled with amusement as she watched the scene unfold—something so full of ease and happiness, so different from the years before.</p><p>In past years, Samuel&#x27;s parents would come over, stirring up chaos and leaving her in a foul mood.</p><p>But this year, Samuel was getting along with them, all of them together in peace.</p><p>It was all thanks to Diana.</p><p>Life wasn&#x27;t truly perfect without a few struggles along the way.</p><p>&quot;Diana,&quot; Rita said with a knowing look, her voice gentle but firm. &quot;Some things do change. What&#x27;s meant for you will be yours. A guy like Steven? He doesn&#x27;t deserve you.&quot;</p><p>Rita understood perfectly—Diana and Steven were never going to happen. She wanted Diana to be her grandson&#x27;s wife, and she was determined to make that happen.</p><p>Diana had a kind heart. Once she loved someone, she would never waver.</p><p>Her grandson Cecil was handsome and was growing into the kind of man she had always hoped for. She could already see him becoming the person she&#x27;d always envisioned.</p><p>Cecil knew it was Queenie who had been scheming against him, but he wasn&#x27;t going to let his emotions get the best of him. Instead of rushing into a confrontation, he&#x27;d learned to wait for the right moment.</p><p>Diana smiled, her expression warm and thoughtful. &quot;Madam Farley, you&#x27;re right. As long as we stay true to our values and keep doing good, we&#x27;ll be blessed in the end.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Exactly, Diana,&quot; Rita agreed with a nod. &quot;Accept what fate brings us, and keep working hard to be the best versions of ourselves. There&#x27;s nothing we can&#x27;t achieve.&quot;</p><p>Rita had suffered her fair share of hardship and endured countless betrayals, but she had emerged stronger, earning the highest honors and carving out a name for herself in the business world with sheer grit and determination.</p><p>When one was at the top, all he heard were flattering words, and after a while, it was easy to lose himself in them.</p><p>Cecil was the perfect example. Raised in a bubble of privilege, he had everything handed to him—until Diana came into his life, making him face challenges and hardships. That was when he finally started to grow into the man he was becoming.</p><p>Diana&#x27;s smile was radiant as if it could blend with the swirling snow outside. &quot;Madam Farley, you speak the truth.&quot;</p><p>She raised her glass, her gaze locking with Rita&#x27;s. &quot;Madam Farley, I&#x27;ll drink to that. Wishing you good health, and in this new year, may peace and prosperity always be by your side, with all worries and troubles far behind you.&quot;</p><p>Rita beamed, her joy evident. &quot;Yes, yes! Here&#x27;s to even better days ahead!&quot;</p><p>The lunch carried on, filled with laughter and a sense of harmony that was rare, but deeply felt.</p><p>In the afternoon, Diana took Luna with her to visit Alexander&#x27;s house.</p><p>Roy hadn&#x27;t returned yet, and Alexander had gone to his family&#x27;s old home to spend Christmas with his parents. Knowing Diana was coming, he&#x27;d returned early to prepare.</p><p>Alexander hadn&#x27;t changed much. He still had the same composed and handsome demeanor Diana remembered from their first meeting.</p><p>&quot;Alexander,&quot; Diana called out, her voice warm.</p><p>The moment he heard his name, the frost in Alexander&#x27;s eyes melted, and a soft, tender smile spread across his face.</p><p>&quot;Diana, Luna, you&#x27;re here! Come in, it&#x27;s freezing outside.&quot;</p><p>Diana and Luna stepped inside, carrying their things, eager to escape the chill of the winter air.</p><p>Today, Steven had no particular plans, so he had Evan drive him around for a change of pace.</p><p>Evan was a man who knew how to play his cards.</p><p>He&#x27;d taken Steven directly to the outskirts of Diana&#x27;s villa, watching as she met with Cecil, then spent hours at the Farley Manor. Now, they were on their way to Alexander&#x27;s place.</p><p>Evan had his agenda. He wanted to see Luna, and he knew Steven wanted to see Diana. Though they hadn&#x27;t spoken about it, Evan could read Steven like an open book.</p><p>Steven didn&#x27;t say anything, but Evan just followed Diana&#x27;s car without question.</p><p>Luna still looked as stunning as ever. After Christmas, she had stopped wearing the cold, harsh black outfits, occasionally opting for softer pinks or vibrant reds. Her new choices made her look even more radiant, her skin glowing with a youthful smoothness. Evan couldn&#x27;t help but smile as he drove. He missed Luna.</p><p>When they reached Alexander&#x27;s house, Evan parked the car and handed Steven a turkey leg.</p><p>Steven grimaced and didn&#x27;t take it, though they hadn&#x27;t eaten lunch yet. Breakfast had been rushed, and now, his stomach was starting to growl.</p><p>&quot;Mr. Gellar, neither of us had a proper lunch today,&quot; Evan said with a grin. &quot;I picked this turkey leg up from the store, and it&#x27;s still warm. There are even some side dishes, that smell amazing—straight from our hometown. Come on, eat up.&quot;</p><p>At least having a few bites of turkey on Christmas would make it feel like a real holiday.</p><p>Steven&#x27;s stomach was starting to growl, so he didn&#x27;t hesitate to take the turkey leg from Evan. With a graceful movement, he took a bite, and the taste was surprisingly good. He looked down at the turkey leg in his hand, savoring the flavor—it was better than he expected.</p><p>He took another bite of the side dish, and that too was delicious. Evan&#x27;s hometown flavors were comforting, but what did he have?</p><p>What Steven had, the thing he truly missed, was the taste of every meal Diana had made for him during those two years she cared for him. Those were the flavors he longed for now.</p><p>He glanced toward the gate of Alexander&#x27;s house, knowing Diana was on her way to meet him. Suddenly, he remembered the purple diamond necklace Alexander had given her, and the thought made the turkey leg in his hand lose its appeal.</p><p>The purple diamonds—those had been given with ulterior motives. Diana was exceptional. Without him, she would find someone who truly loved her. She could meet a man who was better than him, but the thought of her being with another man, of her being someone else&#x27;s woman, made his chest tighten. He felt a rush of discomfort like he was losing control.</p><p>Diana&#x27;s affection for him had been both warm and overwhelming.</p><p>When everyone else had given up on him, Diana had never wanted to let go.</p><p>Just then, Evan struck a nerve, his words like salt in an open wound. &quot;Mr. Gellar, look at the way Mrs. Gellar smiles at Alexander. If she had to choose between these men, it&#x27;d be him.&quot;</p><p>Steven shot him a cold glance but didn&#x27;t say anything. Alexander was indeed impressive, in every way.</p><p>Women in Capitole were all eager to marry him.</p><p>He bit into the turkey leg with force, his thoughts racing, trying to figure out how to put things back in their rightful place.</p><p>There was a storm brewing in his eyes, anger simmering beneath the surface. He muttered under his breath, &quot;She won&#x27;t.&quot;</p><p>Evan turned toward him, his curiosity piqued. &quot;Mr. Gellar, how do you know she won&#x27;t?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="970.html">« Prev</a><a href="972.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
