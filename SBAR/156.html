It was so long that she felt that she would recover, but Steven still didn&#x27;t come.</p><p>She couldn&#x27;t wait any longer. Queenie thought, &quot;If Steven didn&#x27;t come, my wounds will almost heal.&quot;</p><p>Jeff also said, &quot;That shouldn&#x27;t be the case. I&#x27;ve already called him. Let&#x27;s wait a little longer. Maybe he&#x27;s busy with company matters.&quot;</p><p>Queenie&#x27;s face turned pale in an instant, and a hint of anger flashed in her eyes.</p><p>She thought, &quot;Is it really because of busy work?</p><p>Normally, whenever I am injured, Steven would always rush to my side.&quot;</p><p>Queenie had a bad feeling. &quot;Dad, give Steven another call.&quot;</p><p>Jeff dared not to call Steven.</p><p>He only dared to call Evan.</p><p>Jeff turned around to make a phone call. Then, he found that Paula had not arrived yet.</p><p>Jeff thought, &quot;Has something bad happened in the company recently?</p><p>That shouldn&#x27;t be the case. I haven&#x27;t heard that the company is in crisis!</p><p>The other assistant of Paula was the one I arranged. I can ask her.&quot;</p><p>Evan&#x27;s call was connected. Jeff asked with a serious voice, &quot;Evan, where is your boss? Why hasn&#x27;t he come yet? Queenie is making a fuss about looking for him, or else she will commit suicide.&quot;</p><p>Evan was in Steven&#x27;s office at that time.</p><p>After hearing Jeff&#x27;s words, Steven said nothing but he looked angry.</p><p>&quot;Mr. Jeff Marsh, I told you that this was the last time I would help Queenie. This time, it was because of Gale and Queenie who caused trouble. It was Queenie who instigated Harry&#x27;s mother to cause trouble with Diana.</p><p>&quot;Queenie saved my life. Over the years, I have given the Marsh family billions of dollars in cooperation and pocket money. I have already repaid you for saving my life! The Marsh family has been asking me for a favor. Isn&#x27;t that enough?&quot;</p><p>Steven&#x27;s tone was calm, but it made Jeff tremble for fear.</p><p>Jeff was surprised that Steven had become so smart now.</p><p>&quot;Steven, we have never asked you for anything. You volunteered to cooperate with us and gave us pocket money. We only asked you to come and see Queenie. She is ignorant. Can&#x27;t you forgive her? Do you know how much you loved her before?&quot;</p><p>Jeff was a little anxious as this went against his plan.</p><p>It was about to succeed, and Steven didn&#x27;t want any trouble to occur.</p><p>&quot;Steven, I know you don&#x27;t love Diana. The person you love the most is Queenie. Everyone knows it. Queenie is the one you want to marry. Diana has done so many bad things. Queenie and Gale couldn&#x27;t stand it and taught Diana a lesson. We can&#x27;t let Diana ruin the reputation of the Marsh family.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I heard that after she broke up with you, she dated different men every day. Diana is so shameless.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hello... Hello...&quot; Jeff didn&#x27;t finish his words before Steven hung up the phone.</p><p>Jeff looked impatient. He didn&#x27;t expect that Steven would change so quickly.</p><p>Jeff returned to the ward angrily. Looking at Queenie on the bed, he said, &quot;Queenie, how did you offend Steven? He said that he had made it clear to you last time that he would no longer care about your affairs. What happened?&quot;</p><p>When Queenie heard this, she was so angry that she almost cried.</p><p>She looked out the window coldly, and her tone sounded gloomy. &quot;What else could happen? Steven saw the photos and text messages I sent to provoke Diana before, and he knew that I was deliberately destroying their relationship. He no longer trusts me.</p><p>&quot;Diana was so timid before that she never told Steven about this, but I didn&#x27;t expect that I would ruin this.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Diana has already given up and wants to divorce Steven, but Steven doesn&#x27;t want to divorce. The evidence will be used by Diana to sue Steven for cheating, and I am the one who cheated.&quot;</p><p>Queenie looked at Jeff with tears in her eyes. &quot;So, Dad, they must divorce peacefully. I don&#x27;t want people to say I&#x27;m a mistress.</p><p>&quot;Also, have you noticed that Diana has changed and seems to be no longer herself?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="155.html">« Prev</a><a href="157.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
