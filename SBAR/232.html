Why would I do that? I just want things to develop in the direction you want."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her previous life, Gale allowed the robbers to destroy her appearance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, you knew it was going to happen. Why didn't you stop it?" Gale shouted in despair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana said, "I told you several times not to compete.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But you didn't believe me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Haven't you done worse to me than this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When you had people plot against me, rape me, beat me, and steal my design, what were you thinking?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana spoke calmly, but her eyes didn't conceal the hatred in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She said, "Besides, there are still many good shows to watch later. You will know how terrible is the wolf you raised with your own hands. You must live and feel the pain they bring you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked around and asked sarcastically, "Where is Penelope? Why didn't she come to take care of you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale said nothing with his eyes full of gloom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana continued to mock him. "Althea loved you back then, but not only did you cherish her, you deeply hurt her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You don't deserve her love. You and Penelope are perfect for each other. You should keep each other company and stop harming Althea."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale thought of Althea, the nerd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He hated school very much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He just liked to go out and play. And Jeff never stopped Gale and just wanted him to grow up healthily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's words next made Gale feel chilly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She said, "Do you know why Jeff lets you live your life as you please? Because he wants to ruin you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The person who cared about you was always the girl next door. She wanted you to study hard and become successful in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She is now successful and a CEO of a great company. The nerd you once looked down upon is now someone you can't reach."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today, Diana was going to say it all and would celebrate with some champagne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale was shocked. He had not heard from Althea since she left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he was unwilling to admit that his own biological father would want to raise him as a waste.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale shook his head painfully. "No, Diana, you lied to me. You planned all this, didn't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana didn't look at Gale but at Paula. "It seems that you haven't told him the truth yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After all, she is the daughter you raised. Whether she is the daughter of a mistress or not is not important to you. What is important is the family relationship."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula quickly explained, "Diana, I didn't mean that. I didn't tell him the truth because I didn't want him to ruin my plan."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked at Paula and felt no sympathy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, we are a family. Do we really have to let things come to this?" Paula asked, crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana turned around abruptly and looked at Paula with hatred. "Do you know why I have to do this? I have died once. I have never felt the love of a mother from you. It was you and your family who killed me."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="231.html">« Prev</a><a href="233.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
