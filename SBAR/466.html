"No matter how he's killed, we can't be the ones to do it. It's better if Diana handles it; that way, Eric's death will be even more painful for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Frank is dead, Gale is disabled, and Dylan is a fool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And we need someone else to take care of things in Eldale. Eric was behind the incident at our company last time. I can't think of anyone else who'd be capable of that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana could't do it right now. Eric is the only one who'd go after my company. He must have uncovered something about the Woodston incident."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felicity replied, "Got it, Ms. Marsh. I'll keep you updated."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she hung up the phone and sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After buying the land, Diana went to Nolan's headquarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had some design sketches with her and planned to discuss the new spring collection. Her collaboration with Paige had already raised the profile of her men's clothing line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ten male models Leopold found for her were incredible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Diana reached the lobby, she called Nolan to ask him to come down and get her since she didn't have her access card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While waiting at the door, she saw Steven walking out with Evan and some company executives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weather was cold. He wore a black coat, which accentuated his dashing and strong appearance. His features were striking and well-defined, and he carried himself with a restrained demeanor, exuding an irresistible noble aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't want to talk to Steven. She turned around and walked towards the rest area in the lobby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan noticed her reaction and thought, "She must hate Mr. Gellar very much, so she avoided him whenever she saw him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven noticed her as well, and seeing her deliberately avoiding him stirred anger in him. He frowned, turned to Evan, and said, "You go on ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suppressing his curiosity, Evan left with the executives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Diana sat down, she saw Steven approaching and frowned to herself, thinking, "He really is clueless. Can't he see I don't want to talk to him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she stood up to leave, Steven blocked her path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, can I help you?" Diana asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at her with an icy stare. "Do you really want to avoid me that badly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sneered, "Isn't it clear enough? I'm trying to avoid trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt frustrated; she had already told him many times that she didn't want to be contacted unless it was about the divorce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven eyed the design sketches in her hands. "Are those for Nolan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Diana replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'd like to offer you a position as chief designer at my company. I can pay you twice what you're making now," he suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn't help but laugh. "Mr. Gellar, how generous of you. Thanks, but I'm quite happy where I am and don't plan on changing jobs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's Nolan paying you? We can negotiate," he pressed. Diana's designs had been selling like hotcakes upon their release.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was slightly stunned before shaking her head. "Mr. Gellar, I'm not interested in discussing anything but the divorce."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the mention of a divorce, Steven's heart sank. She still wanted to go through with it?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="465.html">« Prev</a><a href="467.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
