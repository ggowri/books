I thought she couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t handle this life, that she wanted to leave me, to run away. I agreed to her condition and silently drew a line between us. To avoid upsetting her, I never tried to find her again after that."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"To me, it seemed like she went off to live the life she wanted. I just hoped she was safe somewhere in this world."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Because of Charlie, my grandpa's company went bankrupt. Everyone in my grandpa's family hated my mom."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But if she stayed with me, Charlie kept hurting her on purpose, bringing different women home to humiliate her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She fought back, but it was useless. Now we understand Mom was acting all along, just to make Charlie trust her, to make him truly believe she</span><span>'</span><span>d gone insane and get kicked out of the Gellar family."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was on the verge of tears. For the first time, Diana saw such a huge shift in his emotions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was blaming himself, filled with regret for not getting to know Jenny better, for leaving her to face those terrible things alone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A whirlwind of emotions crashed over him, leaving nothing but pain in his heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said nothing, just quietly watched him cry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven broke down in tears.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven gave a wry smile and said, "Diana, the only reason I survived those close calls was because of Charlie and Queenie. When someone truly cares about others, there's always a chance to keep going."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Luckily, both times, it was you who saved me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana understood the piercing pain he felt.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was the one who understood it the most among them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Steven, Jenny is the one who gave you life and raised you. You've been hiding in the shadows because of your family, refusing to really see her. Have you ever thought that the person she loves most is you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"To protect your life, to make sure you had no weaknesses, she pretended to be crazy, all so you could take over the Gellar family. You succeeded, yet you doubt her intentions."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She watched you grow from a small sapling into a towering tree, then quietly left to be by Andrew's side."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana meant every word she said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven spent his days hiding in the shadows, too afraid to love, only daring to hate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t understand why his hatred burned so fiercely, yet he was too afraid to let love into his heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's words struck a nerve with Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He clenched his fists tightly, like a wounded beast on the verge of breaking down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A wave of overwhelming sorrow engulfed him instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's sharp words were like blades, cutting straight into the deepest corners of Steven's heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The guilt in his heart left him nowhere to hide.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana watched him consumed by overwhelming sorrow and felt a twinge of regret.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn</span><span>'</span><span>t even want to live anymore; caring about Jenny was out of the question.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought, "How desperate must someone be to hold onto such a fatal mindset?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Charlie played Andrew, embodying the worst side of a father so vividly that it left Steven in agony.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was his grandparents' unwavering love for him that pushed Steven to fight and strive for the sake of the family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He really made it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After recovering, he wasted no time taking everything away from Charlie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, Steven kept sending Diana divorce papers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she was stubborn too, refusing to leave because of his condition.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana walked over, gently wrapped her arms around him, and patted his back. She comforted him softly, "Steven, don</span><span>'</span><span>t blame yourself too much. If I had left you after your eyes were healed, maybe things wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t have been so hard for you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They didn</span><span>'</span><span>t communicate in time, each stubbornly holding their own views, and ended up hurting each other.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, they</span><span>'</span><span>ve let go of many things.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as people hold on to hope for the future, there</span><span>'</span><span>s always a chance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, Diana. Because you stayed by my side, I saw the photos, I found the truth, and I</span><span>'</span><span>m even more certain&mdash;I want to keep you with me. No one can tear us apart."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven held Diana tightly, his voice hoarse, but his heart filled with hope.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was moved. In this moment, Steven was laying bare his inner pain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His emotions found a breaking point in this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She sighed inwardly, a hint of helplessness in her heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana hugged him, gave his shoulder a reassuring pat, then stepped back. "Now that you know the truth, you should cherish them. You're actually luckier than me. Your parents never hurt you. Everything they did was to protect you, to help you stand on your own. They never abandoned you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm way worse off than you. My brothers used the cruelest methods on me. My own mother said the most vicious things anyone could ever hear."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You feel like no one around you loves you. But your grandparents, your parents, even Evan&mdash;they</span><span>'</span><span>ve always been there for you. How could you think you</span><span>'</span><span>re unloved?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's hands trembled as he pulled her into his arms once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He held her tightly, whispering in her ear, "Diana, from now on, you have my love."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He smiled and said, "Those two years with you at the villa were actually the happiest of my life. Those sweet memories play in my mind at night, like scenes from a movie."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But the thought of you possibly losing your life because of me... it breaks my heart."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie and Paula, they saw you as the bad guy. I even joined them in bullying you. Say a lie enough times, and you start to believe it yourself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven knew he would have a day when he'd completely break down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew one day everything he had done would come back to haunt him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "Back then, after dinner, you'd push me out for a walk. You were always talking nonstop behind me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I still remember you saying you wanted to be with me forever."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Back then, I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t answer you because I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t want to give you hope. I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t want to drag you into my mess."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, Steven thought, "If it were possible, I</span><span>'</span><span>d want to hold her hand and walk with her until the end of my life."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But back then, he was blind, stuck in a wheelchair, unable to give her a future.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1099.html">« Prev</a><a href="1101.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
