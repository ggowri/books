Are you going to be like other men who abandon their wives when things get tough?" Paula asked with a heartbroken expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you sell your company, you'll get one hundred million dollars back. And if we can secure an investment, all the company's problems will be solved."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Darling, you know that company might've been your gift to me, but it represents my dignity. How can I live without it? That company has made me happy all these years. Nobody can say I'm just living off my wife anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula let out a bitter laugh. "Honey, you've been living off me for years now. Why still care what others think?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You... Paula, so that's how you really feel? Sure, I married into your family, but I've earned my own money all these years. Don't make it sound so ugly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But Jeff, your health is declining. You just wet yourself earlier, and your memory's getting worse. I'm worried you'll run the company into the ground. I checked your accounts the other day, and the numbers seem off."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, no, that's not true. I check the company books every day. Everything's in order."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff's face turned pale with panic. He... he didn't know why he'd wet himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was humiliating. He couldn't accept becoming like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric said, "Mom, I can fix this. Diana has fifty million dollars. I'll talk to her tomorrow and get her to help you out for a while."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula gave a bitter smile. "Don't bother. Eric, I'm done with your wickedness. All four of you brothers are rotten to the core. I can't afford sons like you anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My company's been in trouble for so long, and neither you nor your father lifted a finger to help. I'm done with all of you." Paula stood up to leave, her heart breaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If only she had discovered Jeff and Queenie's plot earlier, her four sons could have been saved!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric was dumbfounded. "Mom... is disowning me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Paula, stop right there!" Tracey shouted angrily from the stairway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula turned around, looking at Tracey's arrogant demeanor. It was because of Tracey's constant harassment that Jeff's health was deteriorating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Let them have their fun for a few more months. Soon enough, she'd send them all straight to hell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Paula, you haven't given me this month's hundred thousand dollars yet. You're not leaving until I get my money!" Tracey demanded like a thug.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula remained calm, smiling as she spoke. "Tracey, my company is two hundred million dollars in debt. I remember giving you and Dad several million over the years. Why don't you help me through this crisis first? We're family after all. Let's split the debt among everyone! We can clear it faster then. Once it's paid off, I'll give you a hundred and fifty thousand dollars every month. How's that sound?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Two hundred million in debt? Paula, how could you be so reckless? I've always told you that a woman's place is at home with her family. If you'd let my son run the company, you wouldn't be in this mess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just look at how well my son's company is doing! It making millions every month!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom..." Jeff quickly cut her off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula looked surprised. "Jeff, your company makes millions monthly? How come I never knew about this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff forced a smile. "Honey, Mom's just joking. She's only saying that because she wants you to hand the company over to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracey's expression turned awkward as she avoided Paula's gaze. She'd nearly let slip that all the money went to her other grandson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That grandson was running a thriving business overseas.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unlike these four good-for-nothings who burned through millions each month without earning a penny! They were complete wastrels, all of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula had already uncovered certain things. Through careful observation, she'd confirmed that both Jeff's parents knew about Jeff's son abroad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff had been funneling almost all his money to that son overseas.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This family of parasites was truly terrifying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked pained. "Jeff, if you don't want our family to go completely bankrupt, help me figure something out?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="444.html">« Prev</a><a href="446.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
