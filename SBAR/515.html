But Diana liked Steven and married him willingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Steven never took Diana seriously. It's no wonder that Diana insisted on getting a divorce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's sad and funny is that at Queenie's birthday party, Queenie directed and acted in a play to frame Diana. But we all sided with Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie even wants to kill Diana."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Eric felt highly heartbroken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he suddenly missed Diana's meticulous care for him in the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eric, what are you talking about?" Queenie walked over and sat next to Eric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric smiled, looking at her, and said, "I'm asking Steven when he will marry you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smiled shyly, "Eric, what are you talking about? Steven and Diana have never divorced. If you say this, others will find fault with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want to be the third party between Steven and Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric squinted and smiled. It was hard to tell the emotion in his eyes. His voice was as doting as always. "What are you afraid of? Silly girl, you have Mr. Gellar's favor. Who dares to say that you are a mistress?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "It was she who disliked Steven back then. Now, he stands up healthy, and she tries to be his mistress again. But Steven doesn't love her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eric, I'm not." Queenie felt that Eric was a little different. She frowned slightly and looked at Eric. He was no different from usual and still doted on her very much. But she always felt something was strange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Cecil also came. He was wearing a black jacket. He preferred jackets. They made him look even more evil and awesome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Cecil arrived, the auction began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil knew that Diana would not come today as she was receiving an infusion at home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the auction started, Cecil glanced at Queenie coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil's father, Ivan Farley, had spent 50 million to buy that piece of land, and the starting price was also 50 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the host came on stage, he directly stated the starting price. Ten minutes later, Queenie won the land in the western suburbs for 400 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it had to thank Steven for this. When the price reached 250 million dollars, he suddenly raised his card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew Steven's vision, and they all followed suit and raised their cards to bid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was slightly stunned and turned to look at Steven in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven calmly explained, "Sorry, Queenie. I'm used to bidding. I just raised it unconsciously."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was angry. In the end, she bought the land in the western suburbs for 400 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she was delighted because the budget was 450 million dollars, and she only used 400 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric and Steven left together. When they reached the parking lot, Eric looked at Steven with a warning. "Steven, why don't you get a divorce?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned, with anger in his eyes, and warned Eric, "Eric, I've already said it before. That's a matter between us. Just mind your own business."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric smiled sadly. It was pretty painful to live clearly. He looked up at Steven with a mocking look in his eyes. "Steven, Diana wanted to divorce you. When she loved you, you couldn't see her. You were the one who said you wanted a divorce, and you were also the one who didn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, you don't love anyone. You enjoy Diana's efforts while you are entangled with Queenie. You just don't want Diana to leave you, just like you didn't want to be paralyzed and blind after the car accident. Queenie left you when you were in the most difficult time. You just don't want Diana to leave you as well. So, you only love yourself, right?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="514.html">« Prev</a><a href="516.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
