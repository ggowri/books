You want him to give you his company. Who are you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have nothing to do with you. How dare you come to me without shame? Get out! I've never wasted time on people I don't like. Your meaningless tricks won't work on me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff didn't expect Diana to be so resolute, and he was so angry that his blood pressure soared, his lips twitched, and it took him a long time to speak. "You little witch, remember, you are my daughter. How come you are so arrogant? Just because you have someone to rely on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff didn't expect the usually weak Diana to speak so toughly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right, I am arrogant! So, don't bother me, and don't put on a show for me. You've lived off women for so many years. And now, you change your ways and want to get rich without working for it? You really take shamelessness to the extreme."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was furious and thought, "Why do I keep encountering such shameless people in the morning? Why did I go through hardships and come back to live my life again? It's because I feel I haven't lived enough. I want to live for myself. And these bloodsuckers don't expect to control me anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was so angry that his face turned green. "Diana, without me, there would be no you. I am your father. How dare you defy me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, think about it. We are the ones with blood relations to you, not your so-called brother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana laughed angrily, but there was no longer a feeling of sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes had a murderous aura. "Mr. Jeff Marsh, you wanted to cut ties with me first. Now that you're bankrupt, you're targeting your daughter whom you abandoned. There's no one more shameless in the world than you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank thought, "Well said! If it weren't for Jeff forcing me, I wouldn't have come here. He's been a liar from the start. It was he who abandoned Diana, and now, because Diana is rich, he shamelessly made such an unreasonable request. How disgusting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what, you are my daughter. I am now utterly helpless..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You still have four sons. How can you be helpless? I heard you're living together with that mistress now. Your wife probably doesn't know about your affair. If she did, she would probably make you leave everything behind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? How do you know?" Jeff looked at Diana warily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana gave him a disdainful glance. "You are my father, so after you went bankrupt, I've been keeping an eye on your recent situation. You live in a luxury mansion with that mistress while your wife lives in a broken house built decades ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're nothing like a father, let alone a husband. How dare you come to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, I haven't finished yet," Diana coldly interrupted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At the Jace dinner party, you pushed all the responsibility onto me. You were the one who had an affair and made a mistake, yet you accused me of scheming against you. Jeff, was it me who tied you to that woman's bed? Was it me who made you go astray?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If there hadn't been security cameras that night, I would have been ruined by you long ago."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="605.html">« Prev</a><a href="607.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
