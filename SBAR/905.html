"Steven, you've really disappointed me. Back then, you swore you'd never divorce Diana. That was the only reason we handed over the family assets. And now? You not only served her divorce papers because of Queenie's schemes, but you also plan to marry her? Ridiculous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've never seen anyone so dense. I raised you with care, yet here you are, an ungrateful fool, a disgrace willing to team up with someone so vile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ungrateful brat! You're worse than a stray dog. Just like your father, you disgust me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her words were merciless, cutting deep. She paused only because her vocabulary couldn't quite keep up with her anger. If it could, she would've kept going.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Across the room, George forced himself to stay calm, though his fists were clenched tight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He frowned, his voice cold as he asked, "Grandma, why are you so set on me marrying Diana? Why all these rules?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Helen stood abruptly, her laugh cold and mocking. She was more certain this man wasn't Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you seriously asking me that? Don't tell me you don't understand your grandfather's reasoning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She pointed a finger directly at Queenie. "Steven, open your eyes. This woman? She left you without a second thought when times got tough, running off to chase her own dreams abroad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She's only here now because of your money. If you ever lose everything, she'll abandon you again in a heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And then there's Diana. She worked tirelessly to treat your eyes, heal your legs, and stood by you no matter what. She married you, knowing all your flaws. She's the one worth holding onto.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But this woman? She poisoned me, Steven. A slow-acting toxin, meant to kill me. And you still want to marry her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her tone softened for a moment, the anger replaced by deep worry. She didn't know where her real grandson was, and the uncertainty weighed on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her eyes glimmered with unshed tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George's expression shifted, his voice steady but cold. "Grandma, you've been misled. Queenie didn't poison you. It was Diana's trick. She framed Queenie. I've already divorced Diana, and Queenie and I are getting married."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Helen let out a long, heavy sigh, shaking her head. "If that's how it is, then I guess Diana's just unlucky. I'm old now, Steven. I don't have the energy to meddle in your life anymore. Go ahead. Marry her if that's what you want.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you're looking for a wedding gift, take this manor. It's yours now. I'm leaving for abroad to find your grandfather."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was a strange calmness in her words, a resignation that came from letting go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But deep down, her heart ached for Diana, knowing the girl didn't deserve any of this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grandma," George said, his tone dark and unsettling, "you're really not staying for my wedding?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She glanced at him, her gaze colder than ever. "Why would I? I won't celebrate a marriage built on lies and betrayal. Steven, from this moment on, you're on your own. I won't lift a finger to help you again. I'm done. I've got no money, no patience, and no interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Also, don't even think about going after Diana. You signed that agreement yourself. You made this mess, and you're going to live with it. I'm only stepping aside because your so-called great love with Queenie is so inspiring. It's touching, really. The two of you deserve each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I wouldn't dream of standing in the way of your epic love story."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her voice dripped with sarcasm, but in truth, she knew the man standing in front of her wasn't her real grandson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie's eyes hardened as she realized that Helen still refused to accept her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George was equally furious. "Grandma, I'm your most beloved grandson. How can you not come to my wedding? You can't go anywhere. You're staying right here with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His voice carried a clear threat, and Helen heard it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She gave a soft chuckle, her weathered face breaking into a smile that was all too knowing. "Steven, I wish I could bless you. I really do. But I've said this before. I won't give my blessing to a marriage with someone like Queenie, who wants me dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you want to trap me here, then so be it. I'm just an old woman. Nothing scares me anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a smile, she sat down without another word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew kicked the coffee table in frustration. The heavy marble table made a loud crash as Helen's prized porcelain cup shattered on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she watched the cup break into pieces, something stirred in her. Her heart felt alive again, as if it were reborn, beating with a fresh intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom, did you ever think about me when you gave all the assets to an outsider? Did you ever think about your grandson?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew couldn't believe what had happened. The moment the divorce papers were nearly finalized, all the assets had been transferred to Diana's name, as if by magic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Helen looked at him coldly. "Why are you shouting? You ungrateful son. When the agreement was signed, Steven knew everything. He signed it willingly, and he was perfectly fine giving everything to Diana. Now you're blaming me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew's anger flared. "I just don't understand. Why give everything to someone who's not even part of the family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Because of you, of course. What else would it be?" Helen snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew's eyes narrowed. "What do you mean by that? What does this have to do with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Helen smirked. "You still don't get it? Do I need to spell it out for you? Do you want me to tear your face off and crush it into the dirt before you understand?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Andrew, how many illegitimate children do you have? Probably more than you can count. Do I look like I'm going to leave everything to those wild beasts?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana has been with our family for two years. She treats me like her own, and she takes care of Steven with such care. Isn't it right that I look after her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why on earth would I leave anything to the ungrateful brats outside?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?" Andrew said, his voice filled with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom, I think you and Dad have completely lost it. Steven has always been by your side, and you won't give him a thing? Is Diana blackmailing you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Helen didn't answer him. "Since when did you two become so close? Coming here together to demand answers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom, this concerns the future of our family. Of course, we need to stand together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well, that's simple enough. The company you're running? That's mine. I left it to you two. Isn't that enough for you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Andrew, for all the wealth you've accumulated, what have you actually done? You know in your heart what you've done, so stop complaining.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're getting old, and Steven is no better than a fool. Just let Diana take over the company. She's more talented than you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Helen's stance was unshakable. Andrew and George had no way to sway her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie burned with rage, wanting nothing more than to strangle this old woman. She never expected the agreement to take effect so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In a sudden motion, she turned around and saw Diana standing in the doorway. "Diana, how dare you come here?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="904.html">« Prev</a><a href="906.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
