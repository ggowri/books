She didn't know when the drafts were stolen by Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spring collection of the Flowers was one of the hits Diana wanted to make the most of this year. She asked Steven to confirm it twice. She had been very busy for the last half-month. To her surprise, in the end, he gave Queenie her design.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt aggrieved and scolded in a low voice, "Queenie, you have no shame."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven noticed the clothes the model was wearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He narrowed his eyes and glanced coldly at Queenie, who was smiling happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn't it Diana's new design in recent days?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Queenie have it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Diana had shown these styles to him, and he was very satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would definitely be the hottest ones among high-end custom styles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned around abruptly and stared at Steven suspiciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt uneasy and had a premonition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, she growled. "Steven, you bastard, you came to my office to act and said those things in the hotel to let me down my guard in order to help Queenie get my design. I just wondered why you had changed recently, and I thought you really felt guilty and would be nice to me. However, to my surprise, you devised such a scheme to give Queenie my design.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You just want to help her win first place and then clear her name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, have I ever told you not to play this game with me? If you have any requests, just tell me directly, and I will satisfy you, but you are so hypocritical."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He now knew what it felt like not to be able to defend himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, when he didn't trust Diana, did she feel powerless?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He explained, "Diana, I don't know how she got the design drawings. They are still on your computer. How could I get them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said through gritted teeth, "You are the only one who has seen my designs! Also, the five designs on the model are exactly the same as those I sent you. How do you explain it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was upset.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The designs were supposed to be his spring hit, but Queenie's actions cost him hundreds of millions of dollars in lost profits.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was annoying. The designs were indeed saved on his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how did she get them from his phone?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It occurred to him that Diana had said that Queenie was also an excellent hack.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had been schemed against by her many times. She never saved her design drawings on the computer. If she did, they were all encrypted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After QM Company's models finished their show, the audience burst into warm applause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie grinned, sure of victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she glanced provocatively at Diana with a sneer, as if asking Diana whether she was surprised or not!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was very angry, but she could only restrain herself. However, she remained calm and stared at Queenie with contempt, accusing her of being a brazen thief!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie, in a good mood, didn't argue with Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She only knew that Diana couldn't beat her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What struck her was how stunning Diana's design was.&#8203;</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="844.html">« Prev</a><a href="846.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
