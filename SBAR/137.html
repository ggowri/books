"Honey, you know I frequent high-end places. That money isn't enough! Taking other CEOs golfing costs hundreds of thousands. It's all expensive places. It's a money pit."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Of course, all that money had gone into funding his illegitimate son's business venture.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The four sons here were all useless, each one with average intelligence and no business sense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">How could he possibly pin his hopes on these failures?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula took a deep breath. "I'm heading to the office to work overtime. All of you better stay out of trouble. I don't have the energy to deal with you right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Queenie, make something nice for Steven tomorrow morning and bring it over. See if you can strengthen your relationship with him. As for yelling at Diana, it's no use. She's already cut ties with us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie frowned. What was going on? She had a feeling Diana had changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mom, I'll go see Steven first thing tomorrow morning. I'm not giving up on him so easily." She wasn't going to let go of Steven that easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula nodded. "Alright!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even though Paula wasn't feeling well today, she still needed to put on a show for the father and daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Jeff, I haven't been feeling well these past couple of days. My body feels weak, and I'm afraid driving might be dangerous. Can you take me there?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jeff and Queenie exchanged a brief glance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula didn't miss the fleeting moment of joy in their eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Honey, it's so late. Why do you still need to work overtime at the company?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula let out a long sigh. "I don't want to either, but none of my four sons are reliable. They're all doing what they want, and no one is helping me manage the company. You've got your own business to run, and my company hasn't been doing well lately. I've had to sell several properties recently, or else we would've been out of funds by now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Don't overwork yourself, honey. Tomorrow, I'll go with you to talk to the other executives. We'll figure this out." Jeff knew Paula's capability. She wouldn't let the company fail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had run the company well from the start and continued to do so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After they got married, she even gave him a subsidiary to manage, giving him plenty of respect.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had pursued Paula so relentlessly because she was an only child with assets worth hundreds of millions, and women like her often lacked a sense of security.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His presence had given her that sense of security.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That's how the fate of the Marsh family had changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula nodded. "Yes, thank you for understanding my situation, honey. Your business has been doing well. Why don't you take care of the extra money for Mom and Dad for now? They've mentioned needing 150,000 dollars a month to cover expenses. While I'm not short on money, I have to be careful with every penny, so I've already told them to come to you for it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula left after saying this, her voice unusually gentle, making Jeff feel sorry for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But..." Jeff started to say something, but Queenie stopped him. Recently, Paula had been coming home late every night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It seems the company's really going through a tough time. Dad, you should cover the expenses for the next few months. Paula's always been good at business. Once she gets back on track, the company will be doing even better. We'll have her pay for things later, but for now, we can't let her suspect anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"And did you drink the tonic today?" Even if the Barnes family was no more, their real estate alone was worth billions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Plus, the company's office buildings were all owned by the Barnes family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jeff understood. "I drank it. Didn't you hear her say she wasn't feeling well?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jeff sighed. "If it weren't for your mom, I wouldn't be able to leave Paula. Your mom has always shown me so much respect and has been a good wife..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Dad, I've already told you, I refuse to be the illegitimate child. You can't hurt Mom again. This time, you need to make up your mind."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jeff hesitated, finding it hard to let go. Paula had been good to him all her life, but his son was more important.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Alright, alright, I know. I won't go soft. We've been planning this for years. And with your brother's situation improving, I feel more at ease."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula would soon be a crazy woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He couldn't spend the rest of his life with a crazy woman, could he?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The more Jeff thought about it, the more he knew he couldn't go soft.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He thought about his situation. Lately, he hadn't been able to do anything. The doctor said it was related to his frequent use of stamina-enhancing medication.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The medicine had side effects. He didn't dare take it anymore, but now he couldn't perform at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luckily, Paula hadn't been home lately, or else he wouldn't have dared share a bed with her. How had he ended up like this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Feeling rather embarrassed, Jeff stood up and went upstairs to rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had to go to the hospital for more tests tomorrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie returned to her room, angrily sitting on her bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She thought about how Steven hadn't believed her and didn't believe that Diana had drugged his mom. She couldn't think of a better solution in the short term.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What was she going to do?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">For now, she could only try to win over Steven, to make him trust her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But... how was she supposed to win him over?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After a moment of contemplation, Queenie immediately called Evan.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="136.html">« Prev</a><a href="138.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
