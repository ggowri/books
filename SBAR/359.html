Her eyes dimmed. "It's partly because of you, but it is more because of me. I coveted the warmth that I could never get, so I deserved it. As long as I didn't want to, none of you could hurt me. I deserved it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After I woke up, I tried hard to draw a clear line with you. I don't want to get hurt because of you anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She understood what Steven meant. The harm and calculations from others were real, but she was ignorant because she did not resist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she felt powerless to resist, there was no need to struggle anymore. She was the only one who could save herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven shuddered all over. It turned out that she understood that. She didn't love him anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana stood in the moonlight with an aloof temperament.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven had a feeling that one day, she would become powerful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana raised her head slightly, with a faint smile in her eyes, looking very beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Under the night sky, the disharmonious atmosphere became somewhat romantic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, someone interrupted them, "Steven."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The romantic atmosphere was destroyed by Queenie's voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, why are you here?" Queenie asked deliberately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana felt it funny. "This house belongs to me and my honey. Is it weird that I'm here?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you forget who you are because you've been a mistress for so long?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's face turned ugly, and her eyes were filled with anger as if she wanted to tear Steven into pieces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was because he refused to divorce that Diana called her a mistress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, you are talking nonsense. I am not a mistress. You are the one who interfered between Steven and me. If you hadn't come back, we would have been married a long time ago."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana felt very happy when she saw Queenie's ugly expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was the first time Steven heard Diana call him "honey", and he felt a strange feeling in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was right. If Diana came back and acted as a loving couple with him, they might force the man behind Queenie out sooner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then why did you run away? Have you ever thought about why I was found back?" Diana asked with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie brought Diana back to let her marry another wealthy man so that she would have a relationship with another wealthy family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She ignored Diana and looked at Steven. "Steven, I came to you for something. Now that my reputation is restored, I want to talk to you about investment." She said in a gentle voice, looking at Steven expectantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven said, "Who knows what scandal you will have next time? There is no need to talk about investment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven pulled Diana away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking for a while, Diana took Steven's arm to piss Queenie off deliberately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana thought Queenie would not be able to fall asleep tonight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was slightly stunned when he saw Diana holding his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Diana's actions, Queenie was furious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana dared to hold Steven's arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie walked over quickly and pushed Diana away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Diana slapped her without any hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah..." Queenie never thought that Diana would hit her at this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, you hit me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's face hurt. Seeing that Steven didn't help her, she felt depressed in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked at Queenie's surprised expression with a cold smile. "What's wrong? Why can't I hit you? Queenie, are you so eager to be a mistress?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can't control my man, and it's my fault. But you've come to me. Don't I have the qualification to hit you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was frightened by Diana's tough words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was Diana so confident because of Steven?</p><div class="pagination"><a href="358.html">« Prev</a><a href="360.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
