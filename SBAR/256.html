We need to find out who he is, no matter what."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan gazed at his inscrutable eyes and handsome features, momentarily unable to discern his thoughts. "Alright, Mr. Gellar. I've been handling the investigation personally."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps, uncovering this person's identity would turn the tide.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan made a move to depart, yet Steven fixed his eyes on the photographs where Diana's smile beamed back at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps, in his lifetime, he would only encounter someone like Diana once. If she was his one-in-a-lifetime, he couldn't afford to lose her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He murmured, "Diana, I will make it up to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven instructed Evan to return the 100 million dollars in medical expenses Diana had initially paid, along with an additional 100 million dollars as interest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon setting foot on land, Diana checked her phone to find a message from Evan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She returned the extra 100 million dollars to Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She added a note: [I am not worthy of accepting it.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Evan saw this, he remained silent and passed the message to Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Gellar, Ms. Bishop sent back the extra 100 million dollars."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon reading the message, Steven realized his careless words had deeply wounded her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright." Steven merely nodded lightly, dismissing Evan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan shook his head and slowly departed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That very afternoon, Diana took to Instagram to showcase her maritime haul with a flourish: four hefty lobsters, a pair of octopuses, and an assortment of groupers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was still in her diving gear. The delight was evident in her radiant smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven involuntarily smirked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Away from his sight, she was radiantly happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her lively smile was etched deeply in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His gaze upon Diana was exceptionally bright, tinged with a hint of lingering affection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana spent three days with Althea, who was overjoyed. When it was time to leave, Althea asked Diana to take a full cart of seafood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The day Diana returned, Alexander also came back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roy Powell, Alexander's grandfather, frequently invited Leopold out for fun.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was grateful to Roy for bringing joy to her grandfather every day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She carefully selected two boxes of the finest seafood and sent them to Roy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roy and Leopold had not yet returned, so it was Alexander, looking exhausted from his trip, who greeted her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander had lost weight after being away for a few days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His handsome face appeared even more chiseled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a smile, he took the seafood from Diana's hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He lowered his eyes, gazing at her tenderly. "Diana, it's so heavy, and you should have let me get it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His voice was gentle, and the reporters nearby happened to capture this tender moment and Diana's bright, smiling profile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As they entered the villa, this news mysteriously made its way to the hot search list.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was already late autumn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The night breeze was cool.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander was in white casual attire, and Diana wore a white sweatshirt. Facing each other, they looked incredibly cozy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Wow, these two are drop-dead gorgeous, and it's like they're absolutely made for each other.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Has anyone else noticed Mr. Powell's eyes? They're so tender. I swear I could lose myself in them.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[He's all gentle and sweet on the outside, but I wonder how he treats her at home. My dream guy finally has this stunning girl by his side. I'm green with envy.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[But who is this beautiful girl?]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the online discussion continued, someone responded to the inquiry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[I know this chick. She's the Marsh family's adopted daughter. A total pretender. Ever since she got taken in, she's been scheming against the real daughter. Now that the Marsh family has shown her the door, she's just after Mr. Powell for his cash.]</p><div class="pagination"><a href="255.html">« Prev</a><a href="257.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
