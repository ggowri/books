"Penelope, you've ruined me! Do you know who lives in room 408? The police chief's wife! You think you can just mess with his kid and get away with it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope opened her mouth to respond, but Felix leaned in closer, whispering, "You know what to say. You'll want to negotiate for leniency."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope thought, panic rising, "This is it. Forget about the money; I'm headed straight for prison now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Rachel, what... what are you talking about? How could this happen?" Penelope stammered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Penelope, you're going to get me killed!" Rachel shouted back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where's the kid?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rachel said, "I'll arrange for the kid to be killed. If the chief of police ever finds out it was us who nabbed his child, we're done for."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's eyes narrowed with a dangerous glint as he shot Penelope a look, urging her to ask about the child's whereabouts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope caught on and asked, "Aunt Rachel, if it's the police chief's son, how can we possibly get rid of him? You need to return the child so we can avoid getting caught!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rachel snapped, "Are you out of your mind? My boyfriend took the kid! Do you want him arrested?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Penelope's mind raced, and a plan began to form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Rachel, your boyfriend is a criminal! He's already committed a kidnapping! That's not on us! Get him to return the child now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Penelope, you've put me in a corner! You said your friend was just a regular person! You said we could snatch a kid and make a quick million? Now that it's a police chief's son, the whole island is on high alert! If you want him to return the kid, you're asking for a death sentence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope's voice rose to a frantic pitch. "If he doesn't bring the kid back, we're dead! What matters more, your boyfriend or our lives? Think about it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope was desperate; she couldn't afford to end up in jail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rachel snapped, "Penelope, you're the one who schemed against an innocent child! My boyfriend was just helping you out! You can't just throw him under the bus! I won't let that happen! You figure it out; you stole the kid, not us! If the cops ask me, I'll say it was all your doing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Rachel, you can't do this to me!" Penelope shouted, frustration boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Rachel had already hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix turned to his team. "Get Dr. Max. Bring her in quietly; we don't want to alert anyone else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it. I'll send someone right away," the officer replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, they escorted Penelope to the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, the wind howled fiercely, whipping snowflakes around like daggers, making the world a white blur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each step was a struggle for Penelope, who was pregnant and underdressed for the biting cold. The chill stung her face, and she felt utterly miserable, tears streaming down her cheeks as she trudged along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Rachel was being apprehended, Penelope was being led into the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Rachel caught sight of Penelope being brought in, she crumpled to the floor, panic gripping her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused, "This is it, it's all over. Everything I've done these past years is about to come crashing down. If they connect me to those previous kidnappings, my life is ruined."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both women were taken into a private room. Felix strode in, his imposing figure casting a shadow that filled the space with an oppressive atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He laid down the law, his voice gravelly and low. "Take a look at this. How many years sentence do you think you're facing?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="566.html">« Prev</a><a href="568.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
