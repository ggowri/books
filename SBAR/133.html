Queenie didn't believe it. Why would Steven suspend her card?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Olivia and Diana stood up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Olivia rolled her eyes at Queenie and said, "What the hell? You made us wait in vain. Are you kidding me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Queenie, you are a well-known young lady. If you didn't want to buy clothes for your friend, you could refuse directly. Why did you do this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Look at how gloomy your friend looks. She's pregnant. Don't make her angry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Olivia finished speaking, she left with Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie didn't believe that Steven would suspend her card.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie took out her cell phone and called Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But then she heard Steven's cell phone ringing nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie turned around abruptly and saw Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana and Olivia, who were about to leave, also saw Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven stood under the dazzling light, looking dignified and arrogant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana glanced at Steven lightly and was about to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But she was blocked by Steven, who said in a deep voice, "Diana, it was my negligence to give Queenie the card. I didn't consider your feelings. In the future, I will give you another card. You can buy whatever you want."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was so angry that she laughed at his words. How could he have the nerve to say such a thing?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She didn't want his money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She wanted to get back what was owed to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No, Mr. Gellar. Back then, I spent 100 million dollars to treat your eyes and legs. Please return the money to me. After all, you are so rich. You can give billions of dollars to your mistress. I thought about it. Why should I treat you for nothing?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I will send the list of herbs to Evan and ask him to check it. I won't charge you a penny more or take advantage of you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, do you have to talk to me like this? I know I was wrong before, but I'm busy with business matters. I won't do it again in the future..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"There is no future between me and you. If you care about me, just get a divorce. Queenie has been provoking me like this for two years. Even when she is abroad, her text messages never stop."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, you framed me again, you schemed against me in front of Steven again, when did I ever send you a text message to provoke you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie believed that Diana would not be so stupid to show the text message to Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She looked at Steven with tears in her eyes and said, "Steven, I have never done anything like that. Diana always frames me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Since the day you left, you have been sending me provocative text messages and photos of the two of you showing affection. I showed them all to Steven. You dare not take responsibility for what you did?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie's face turned ghostly pale.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="132.html">« Prev</a><a href="134.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
