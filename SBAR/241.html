Life or a business deal?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana suddenly remembered that in her past life, after Gale's car accident, the Farley family also suffered a tragedy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil's father had died in that accident, and Rita was devastated, never recovering from the blow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Within a few months, the company was taken over by a foreign corporation. In the end, Cecil met a tragic death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eventually, the company ended up under Queenie's name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ten years later, Queenie was someone even Steven had to look up to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't because Queenie was particularly capable, but because she was good at leveraging the people around her to climb higher.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In this regard, she was quite skilled at expanding her network.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, she had even coaxed Steven into investing in a film for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, I'll hang up now. I need to call my father," Cecil said urgently. He knew that his father's accident would be too much for Rita to bear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In Rita's eyes, he wasn't yet strong enough to support the Farley family alone. The truth was if Diana hadn't shown up...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He would still be a carefree playboy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, Cecil. Go handle it. Call me if you need my help," Diana replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil hung up the phone and looked at Olivia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Olivia shook her head at him, and Diana's heart tightened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Olivia said, "His calamity can't be avoided."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana asked anxiously, "Olivia, do you have any way to save Mr. Farley's life?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Olivia thought for a moment. Diana had asked for help, so she decided to assist her before leaving. She smiled. "Diana, since you donated 10 million to the church, I'll help you, not Cecil. We'll need to visit his home to see what's happening."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana called Cecil. "Cecil, Olivia is willing to help. We're coming to your house. Is it convenient for you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil was very anxious. "Diana, I can't reach my father or his assistant. Thank you for being willing to help. I'm at home. I'll send a driver to pick you up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shook her head. "No need. That would waste too much time. We'll head over right now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Olivia grabbed her things and left with Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Half an hour later, they arrived at the Farley Manor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rita was there, looking tense. When she saw Diana and Olivia arrive, she sighed in relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Olivia turned to Cecil and said, "Hurry, there's no time. Give me a picture of your father."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil immediately went to get a photo. A minute later, he came back with a picture and handed it to Olivia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Olivia went into a separate room, and no one dared to disturb her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil was extremely anxious. He couldn't reach his father, and both he and his grandmother were very worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana sat beside Rita, holding her hand. She looked at Rita's hair and saw a mother's concern for her children, her eyes glistening with unshed tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grandma, don't worry. With Olivia here, everything will be fine. She's truly capable," Diana assured her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rita didn't speak; she only nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana waited until Cecil finished his call before asking, "You still can't reach your father?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="240.html">« Prev</a><a href="242.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
