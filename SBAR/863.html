"Sam, don't be angry, and I'll go down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet was really afraid that Sam would be angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Carolyn came to the Young family, he did not love Janet as much as before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of here! From today on, move out of the Young Villa. </span><span>I</span><span> will stop all cooperation with your company. You are already 26 years old, and the Young family could not support you forever</span><span>, you need to take your own responsibility now.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..." Janet was horrified. If she was kicked out of the Young family, and all cooperation was cut off, wasn't this going to kill her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to quibble, but seeing that Sam was </span><span>going crazy</span><span>, she didn't dare to say anything and got out of the car in shame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before getting out of the car, Janet glared at Diana fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If </span><span>Diana</span><span> hadn't suddenly appeared, Carolyn would have had no chance of surviving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they died, the Young family's property </span><span>would </span><span>bec</span><span>o</span><span>me hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana asked Sam to come up and help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They lay two seats flat, and the space becomes larger instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was too late, and the baby was about to come out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking her medicine, Carolyn had no problem having a natural birth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at Sam. "Quick, take out the delivery bag, and turn up the heater in the car."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, okay." He did as she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana covered Carolyn with the blanket beside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain in her belly was getting worse and worse, and Carolyn couldn't stand it any longer. "I can't stand it anymore. It hurts so much. It hurts so much..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..." She only felt a force rushing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Carolyn felt relieved, and the pain in her belly suddenly stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was very happy as she saw the baby was born. "Okay, it's </span><span>done</span><span>, and don't move."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took out the scalpel from her bag, disinfected it, and cut the umbilical cord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the baby didn't cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Diana picked up the little guy's warm little feet and patted his butt a few times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crying was not very loud, just a weak voice like a kitten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was healthy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Sam and said, "Congratulations! It's a boy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam was very happy that both Carolyn and the child were safe. That was great.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, doctor. How is my wife?" He looked at Carolyn nervously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled and said, "Not bad, but she is too tired."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first baby she had delivered since her rebirth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her previous life, she was pregnant with a son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought of them being smashed into a pulp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes suddenly turned red. Then, she quickly placed the child in a small quilt beside her and wrapped the child up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana let him lie on his side and quickly helped Carolyn clean the placenta.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly cleaned her body, then put a soft blanket under her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana picked up the child and put him next to the weak Carolyn to show her, "Madam, please have a look, </span><span>he</span><span>'</span><span>s safe</span><span>. </span><span>A</span><span> little boy, delicate and chubby."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was very much like Sam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam smiled and sat over. "Carolyn, did you see that? Our child is safe. He looks a lot like me. Carolyn, thank you for your hard work."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tried hard to open her eyes and looked at Sam, "Sam, don't touch my baby. The baby is mine. We will get a divorce until my body recovers a little."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam frowned, "Honey, we can talk about divorce later, and you should have a good rest now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn didn't have the energy to speak. She looked at Diana and said, "Doctor, you promised me that you would protect my child and never let my child leave your side."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at her and gave her a reassuring look. "Okay! You rest assured, and we will go to the hospital later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn was very tired. Hearing Diana's words, she fell asleep peacefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam watched her sleep peacefully and finally breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at the </span><span>traffic jam </span><span>in front of him and became anxious</span><span> again</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doctor, can I see the baby?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at him indifferently. "I'm sorry, I promised your wife not to let the child get close to you. If you want to see it, just take a look."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sam felt extremely distressed. How did things turn out like this between them?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="862.html">« Prev</a><a href="864.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
