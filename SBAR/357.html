She couldn't escape and would instead be covered in bruises. She thought she would have many opportunities to escape when they arrived at the villa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was a very deep person. In her previous life, Diana had always followed him and watched him scheme against others and eliminate his competitors one by one. He had two different temperaments, and the mysterious one made her unable to see through him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In both of her lives, she never saw through Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was very satisfied seeing that Diana didn't make any trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You've been playing outside for more than half a year. It's time to go home." Steven's voice was low and cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing these words, Evan wanted to scold Steven. Couldn't he just give in?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was it difficult to say some sweet words?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven deserved to be a single man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana ignored Steven. It was so tiring to talk to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Back then, Steven kicked her out, but now he wanted her back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing that she was silent, Steven frowned and said, "Diana, you used to be obedient and sensible..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's because I loved you before, and I also expected the Marsh family to treat me well. Now that I have no expectations and no hope. I won't be bullied by you and be your babysitter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie is right. I was your free babysitter, but I don't want to be that now. None of you can force me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was helpless. "Why do you think so?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was about to say something but stopped. Since the mistake had been made, no matter how much he said, it was useless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he shut up, the car became quiet instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The night in the city was prosperous. Neon lights flashed, but Diana's eyes were full of loneliness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven glanced sideways at Diana, who seemed to be in a different world from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, he felt Diana was someone out of reach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Forty minutes later, the car drove into the villa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan got out of the car and gave Steven an encouraging look. He was telling Steven not to lose his wife again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven didn't say anything. He bent down into the car and pulled Diana out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing the villa, Diana was so angry that she laughed. This was the place she least wanted to come to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was the house that Steven bought for Queenie. Diana didn't know about it before and lived here for two years. Now every time she came here, her heart ached. "Steven, how long are you going to humiliate me? This is the wedding house you prepared for Queenie and you. I have lived here for two years. Isn't that enough? Now you take me back here to humiliate me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven frowned as he looked at the villa. "At that time, I thought I would marry Queenie. But I didn't, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now she won't come here anymore. I changed the password.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The password is your birthday."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was a little surprised. Could he remember her birthday?</p><div class="pagination"><a href="356.html">« Prev</a><a href="358.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
