His presence was overwhelming, and facing him made her nervous.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She avoided his gaze, keeping her head down. Her entire body was tense, instinctively rejecting his touch.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven said, &quot;What&#x27;s wrong? Back then, when you took care of me, you even tried to seduce me. Now you&#x27;re acting like a coward?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana was pissed off. &quot;Who seduced you? Steven, don&#x27;t talk nonsense. At that time, you couldn&#x27;t take care of yourself, and Evan was busy at work. You had no one to help, so I helped you clean up and took care of you. And now you say I was seducing you?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Steven, do you have a conscience?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven smirked, &quot;A conscience? Where would I get that from? My mother ignored me, and my father wanted me dead. Only my grandparents protected me. If it weren&#x27;t for them, I&#x27;d already be a corpse.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Oh, is that so?&quot; Diana sneered. &quot;Then someone like you, so eager to stay alive, ends up giving his life away to others. Steven, I&#x27;ve never seen anyone as pathetic as you.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She pushed his hands away forcefully.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven, afraid of hurting her, didn&#x27;t resist.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He sighed inwardly and decided to wait.</p><p style="text-align:left;">When that man showed up, things would become clear. He wouldn&#x27;t need to explain.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie had used that man to ruin the bond he once had with Diana.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Noticing her bad mood, Steven softened his tone. &quot;Diana, lunch is still a while away. I&#x27;m going out for a bit. If you&#x27;re bored, watch a movie.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana waved dismissively, absorbed in watching her company&#x27;s livestream. She was overjoyed at the rising sales figures.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Year-end sales with a zero-return rate kept her spirits high.</p><p style="text-align:left;">With great designs and quality, she was making money.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She said, &quot;Do whatever you want. You don&#x27;t need to tell me.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven smiled helplessly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana didn&#x27;t even look at him, focusing on the sales and skus.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven left the house and went to the garage.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After getting into his car, he called Evan.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Zora and her son have been arrested. They&#x27;re at the police station now. But she hasn&#x27;t implicated Queenie, only admitting to her crimes.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven said, &quot;That&#x27;s fine. Queenie still has her uses. Assign three reliable bodyguards to watch her and Mario closely. The man we&#x27;re waiting for is coming back. We&#x27;ve already picked up signs from Andrew&#x27;s communications.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Evan replied, &quot;Understood, Mr. Gellar. But I&#x27;ve received word that Queenie is heading toward the Gellar Manor now.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven frowned. He couldn&#x27;t let Queenie disrupt lunch today.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He replied, &quot;Got it. Notify the overseas team to start the meeting.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He opened his laptop to prepare for a critical international meeting.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The Gellar Manor still had Queenie&#x27;s people in it, so precautions were necessary.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Meanwhile, Diana watched the livestream for 20 minutes before switching to a popular variety show.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After another 20 minutes, she got up to stretch and walk around.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Suddenly, the doorbell rang.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Thinking Steven had returned, she went to open the door.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But standing outside was Queenie.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana frowned.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie sneered, revealing her true colors. &quot;Surprised to see me?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana shook her head. &quot;Not really. Just disgusted.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie&#x27;s composed demeanor cracked. &quot;You...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;If you&#x27;re here to see Zora, she and her son are at the police station. You&#x27;ll have to visit them there,&quot; Diana said casually.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie snapped, &quot;Why would I look for them? Their actions have nothing to do with me. It&#x27;s almost Christmas, and I came to visit Helen.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana glanced at the gift box in Queenie&#x27;s hands and sneered, &quot;What&#x27;s in there this time? More slow-acting poison?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie was enraged and raised her hand to slap Diana.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But Diana was faster.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She slapped Queenie across the face.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie cried out in pain, &quot;Diana, you dare hit me?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana said nonchalantly, &quot;I already did. Why ask such a dumb question? Queenie, you&#x27;re regressing.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I&#x27;m here to see Steven. Where is he?&quot; Queenie said, trying to push past her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana blocked her way. &quot;Here to tattle? Queenie, your true colors are already exposed. Do you think Steven will still side with you? How long are you going to lie to yourself?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Given Steven&#x27;s attitude at the hospital and what happened to Evan, he realized how vicious Queenie was.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was good. Queenie&#x27;s actions would reveal her true colors to Steven.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie smirked confidently, &quot;Diana, no matter what happens, Steven will always love me. You&#x27;ll see.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana didn&#x27;t believe her for a second. Steven wasn&#x27;t a fool. For the sake of his family, he wouldn&#x27;t allow someone like Queenie to get away with her schemes.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She knew Steven&#x27;s character well.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Queenie,&quot; Diana said firmly, &quot;I believe you. He will side with you no matter what happens.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;But as I said, crocodile tears won&#x27;t win you sympathy forever.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Your fake kindness is meant to deceive and achieve your hidden goals. But lies will be exposed, and your true colors will be seen.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You&#x27;ll see your pretense is meaningless. You&#x27;ll end up facing betrayal and contempt.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Queenie, you pretend to be gentle and kind, acting like you depend on others.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;But you&#x27;re not like that. You don&#x27;t want to rely on anyone. You just want to step on them to climb higher. Congratulations! You missed your step with Paula.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Having lived again, she finally understood this.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Sometimes, she woke up at night thinking about this and called herself stupid. She was so foolish that she had to live again to see Queenie&#x27;s true nature.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie trembled but sneered, &quot;What&#x27;s wrong with wanting to climb higher? I use my methods to get what I want. What&#x27;s wrong with that?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="885.html">« Prev</a><a href="887.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
