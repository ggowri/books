They always knew Queenie had ulterior motives. He said he wanted you to marry Steven. At the time, to keep your identity hidden, I agreed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>Edward confronted Jeff and exposed Queenie's true colors. The Gellar family wanted the real eldest daughter of the Marsh family. That</span><span>'</span><span>s when your biological father showed up at the door."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At that time, Edward was afraid Queenie would ruin Steven, so he insisted Steven had to marry you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I told Edward that forced love would never bring happiness. He didn</span><span>'</span><span>t believe me, and you ended up suffering for years because of it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold shot Edward a sharp glare.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edward chuckled softly, saying nothing. Back then, his hands were tied. At least things turned out well in the end.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tears streamed down Diana's face as she cried, "Grandpa, you watched me suffer and didn</span><span>'</span><span>t save me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold smiled gently. "I wanted to save you, but you only cared about Steven and refused my help."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt utterly wronged!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She deserved it!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She turned to Steven, tears streaming down her face. "Steven, I</span><span>'</span><span>ve become the one who saved your life."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, Diana was still outsmarted by Leopold and Edward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though she adored Steven, being manipulated left her utterly miserable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her, a spark of emotion flickering in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So this was how Diana ended up by his side&mdash;because she loved him!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had always known it, but hearing it from her family and from her own lips still shook him to the core.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven strode over to Diana, gripping her hand tightly. His voice softened as he said, "Diana, I wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t part of your past, but I</span><span>'</span><span>ll be there for every step of your future. And there</span><span>'</span><span>s something I need to tell you&mdash;I</span><span>'</span><span>ve liked you for a long time. I</span><span>'</span><span>ve wanted to chase you for even longer. Honestly, I</span><span>'</span><span>ve probably loved you just a few months less than you</span><span>'</span><span>ve loved me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He always believed true love could withstand time, endure the years, and survive separation. But what he couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t bear was the ache of longing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every single day she was away, he missed her desperately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at him. Steven's gaze was filled with deep affection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana frowned and said, "Steven, I don</span><span>'</span><span>t feel your love for me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven let out a bitter laugh. "Diana, I feel exhausted every single day," he said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shot him a glare. "Well, that's your own fault!" she snapped.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven shook his head gently. "No, Diana. It's because I think about you every single day."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But even at my most exhausted, thinking of you still moves me. You're my strength. After you left, I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t want to die anymore. I just wanted to live&mdash;to bring you back home and have a child with you, one that's ours."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had mentioned the idea of having a child before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sighed, feeling a bit helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven saw she wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t angry and kept smiling. </span><span>"</span><span>Diana, the moment I met you, I fell in love with you.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt her heart race.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But after everything in our past life, can we truly find happiness in this one?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Time has blurred so much, but the pain still lingers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"For the rest of my life, I just want to cherish myself!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold, tears streaming down his face, said, "Diana may have been cold to you before, but she didn't hurt you as much as Paula did."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back then, it was for Paula's love that Diana recklessly went to the Marsh Villa.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold would never allow Diana to suffer or be bullied by the Marsh family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven joined in bullying Diana too. If it weren't for Edward, Leopold would have taught Steven a harsh lesson.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that time, his family was dealing with some issues of their own.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold had no choice but to return home to handle family matters, leaving Diana to live like that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Diana is both her father's weakness and his armor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt a pang in her heart. Thinking back to seeing Paula this morning, she seemed more worn out than before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Diana had already repaid Paula's kindness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Helen said, "Diana, sometimes leaving and hurting are what teach us how to truly love someone. Whether you forgive Steven or not, it's your choice. We'll always support you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at Helen. She had always been such a warm and kind person.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled softly, deeply touched.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Helen, I've already agreed to give him a chance. If he blows it, then that's on him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven held her hand tightly, staying silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana turned to Jenny and asked, "So, what secret were you planning to tell me when you asked to meet on January 8th?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This had been bothering her all along.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jenny smiled and said, "Diana, back then, I was worried you'd be too upset. I wanted to tell you about me and your dad. To let you know&mdash;you</span><span>'</span><span>re not alone. We</span><span>'</span><span>ve got your back."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But that day, he suddenly collapsed, and I couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t meet you. Later, I secretly sent someone to investigate and found Steven was already by your side. So, we decided to wait. Wait for the day the Mysterium Organization falls, so we can finally appear before you openly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Edward and Leopold have been investigating this for years."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That man was your dad's sworn enemy. For the sake of his research, he didn</span><span>'</span><span>t even spare your father."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Over the years, they gradually uncovered the truth."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana anxiously turned to Leopold, "Grandpa, is my dad still alive? Is his enemy dead?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wondered if she needed to find another place to hide.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold shook his head and said, "A bomb wiped him out completely. There's no way he could've survived."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"To keep him from discovering you, I secretly sent you and your three siblings to the island to be raised. But none of this concerns you. We dealt with the Mysterium Organization behind the scenes."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana</span><span>,</span><span> wrap things up here. I need to get you home as soon as possible to help your father."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana asked again, "Grandpa, where is our homeland?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt overwhelmed by the barrage of truths hitting her today.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold chuckled, "You'll find out when we get back. I'll have a surprise waiting for you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold gently tapped her forehead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your father never married, and you're his only daughter. Taking you back means facing challenges, not living in luxury."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt a pang of grievance. "Grandpa raised me so carefully, only for me to become a pawn in some high-society feud?" she thought.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1119.html">« Prev</a><a href="1121.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
