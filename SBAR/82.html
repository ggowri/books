We'll bide our time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this life, she was determined to protect her three brothers and grandfather.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wouldn't let them meet the same miserable end they had in her previous life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her brothers truly loved her. In her past life, she'd been bewitched somehow and abandoned them for the Marsh family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, she'd died along with her unborn child, leaving her brothers heartbroken.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias smiled indulgently, "Alright, we'll do as you say. Go get some rest. Olivia won't be back tonight either."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nodded. "Okay. You guys turn in early too."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was exhausted and headed upstairs to rest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unbidden memories of her past life surfaced in Diana's mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back then, only Tobias had tried to cheer her up when she was down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When she felt wronged, he'd buy her gifts to lift her spirits.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even when she lost her temper with him, he never got angry. Instead, he'd comfort and counsel her patiently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the wisdom of her past life, Diana knew she could trust only Olivia, Leopold, and her three brothers. Everyone else was suspect.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her previous life had been so exhausting. This time around, she was determined to live happily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias and Leopold watched Diana's retreating figure. Leopold furrowed his brow, saying, "That girl... I can't help but worry. You three brothers need to work hard and make money to protect your sister."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias smiled, "Don't worry, Gramps. We're prepared. We won't let anything happen to Diana."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold spoke earnestly. "She has such a kind heart. I'm afraid her kindness might be her downfall. It's fine to be kind, but you need to have an edge too."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias understood his concern. A flash of sympathy crossed his eyes as he said, "Grandpa, I'll take good care of Diana, don't worry. Besides, you know how capable she is. Her three brothers are no match for her. I heard she whipped the company into shape today and is even planning to sign a contract with the Powell family."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold grinned proudly, "Well, I didn't raise you kids for nothing. You're all business whizzes. You're all doing great, but I still haven't found my second chance at love. Come on, I'm off to bed. Tomorrow I'll keep looking for my soulmate at the park."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd been going on about this for years but was still flying solo.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias shook his head and chuckled. Leopold was such a big kid sometimes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Standing up, Tobias gazed out at the deep night sky. He knew Diana truly didn't love Steven anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she'd loved Steven throughout her youth. He wondered if she could really let go this time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anyone would do, but it absolutely couldn't be that cold-hearted Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Born in darkness, he could never bring light to anyone's life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next day</span><span>&#65292;</span><span>Diana printed out her proposal and went to meet Alexander.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had arranged to have lunch with Alexander.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The whole point was to show Alexander her collaboration proposal.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She asked Nolan to join them and waited for him outside the restaurant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After just two minutes, Nolan showed up. He was strikingly handsome with a calm, aloof aura, yet his features were soft, and his smile was warm and inviting.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana beamed at the sight of him. "Nolan! I haven't seen you in six months. Have you gotten even taller?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nolan's smile was as smooth as jade. "Diana, you must be joking. At my age? I've just lost some weight, that's all."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana knew he had indeed lost weight. "Seems like you've been working too hard lately. Now that I'm back, I can help lighten your load."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nolan gazed at her smiling eyes and teased, "So Diana, you're really not going back to the Gellar family? Planning to focus on your career instead?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hoped she could move on. Steven wasn't the right man for her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana flashed a bright smile. "That's right! I'm not going back. Let's go meet Mr. Powell."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they entered, they saw Queenie and her best friend Penelope Max, who was also engaged to Gale, the eldest of the Marsh family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two women spotted Diana as well.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="81.html">« Prev</a><a href="83.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
