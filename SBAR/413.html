I had quite a struggle catching it last night. My hand was even pricked. Luckily, it didn't pinch me. Once your grandmother is discharged, you should learn to swim, too. Then I'll take you diving."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure! Thank you, Diana!" Joseph's gaze was fixed on her injured finger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In truth, her finger was just scratched, not affecting her ability to do things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Priya was off for a checkup and wasn't in the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana headed towards the kitchen, with Joseph nervously following behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had cleaned the kitchen very thoroughly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana lifted the lid of a pot, and a burnt smell immediately wafted out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph spoke softly, like a child who had done something wrong, "I'm sorry, Diana. I'm not very good at cooking."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled and ladled the soup out of the pot. "Alright, you go wait for Priya. I'll cook. Dinner will be ready in forty minutes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph asked excitedly, "Diana, will you stay for dinner tonight?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana thought for a moment and said, "Sure. I'll cook, and you wait for your grandmother to come out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay! I'll wait for Grandma. We'll be right back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph looked at Diana with a beaming smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She began to wash the pot. He watched her for a while and then left to wait for Priya, feeling warm inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After cleaning the pot, Diana took out the lobster, prepared it, and then started making dinner methodically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph returned to the kitchen door, watching Diana's every move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her silhouette was beautiful, and her every action was graceful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing her turn around, he quickly pulled his head back behind the wall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana, engrossed in making dinner, didn't notice Joseph's gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">An hour later, Joseph returned with Priya.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Priya was very happy to see Diana. "Ms. Bishop, I'm so glad you're here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana nodded with a smile, "Priya, please sit down. I've made soup. Let's have dinner together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wonderful! Ms. Bishop, thank you so much. You're so busy, yet you still came to make dinner for us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I had nothing to do today, so I came to see you. Seeing you recover so well, I'm relieved."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you!" Priya expressed her gratitude. "Ms. Bishop, it's all thanks to you. Because of you, I'm healthy and can continue to be with Joseph. If I can live, I naturally want to live a few more years, to see Joseph succeed in his career, get married, and have children."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph said with a smile, "Grandma, you're healthy now. You must rest well and stay healthy. I'll take care of making money. I'm an adult now, Grandma. Trust me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Priya sat down happily. "Of course, I believe in you. Joseph is the best."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana served the food. Priya had a light taste. She made a light cabbage salad, seafood soup, and stir-fried cuttlefish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph hadn't had such a delicious meal in a long time. He finished the remaining soup in one go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After dinner, Priya lay down to rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph escorted Diana downstairs to hail a taxi.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, thank you for tonight. I'm very full," Joseph said with a pure smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing him happy, Diana was also delighted. "I'm glad you liked it. I'll head back now. You go up and stay with your grandmother. Call me anytime if you need anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Joseph could say anything, he heard a mischievous voice. "Joseph? What a coincidence running into you here."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="412.html">« Prev</a><a href="414.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
