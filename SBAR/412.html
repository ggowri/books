As the breeze blew, his firm abs were faintly visible. His perfect physique and robust chest were incredibly attractive, exuding a raw masculine sex appeal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was instantly stirred, her heart fluttering with desire. She blushed involuntarily, waiting for Steven's response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven buttoned up his shirt slowly before speaking casually, "Because my grandfather wouldn't give what I couldn't have to a bastard. He'd only donate everything to society and charity."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie suddenly came to her senses. No wonder Andrew insisted she marry Steven and then quietly take his place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was this will real?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But if Diana and Steven didn't divorce, she couldn't marry Steven unless he was willing to stand up to Edward for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No, she had another way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Edward were to die unexpectedly, and she found and destroyed that will, everything would fall into place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's eyes cooled as he watched Queenie lost in thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie felt a stomachache. Steven was preparing for a meeting and didn't bother to get her anything to eat, so she left in anger. Back in her room next door, she was still sullen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's words from tonight were like a slap in the face, mocking her departure "under no choice" in the past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He favored her out of gratitude for her life-saving grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But how could Steven not see through those lies?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just like before, he saw her clumsy methods and knew she framed Diana, but because of his preference for her, he would still help her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, Steven had lived in a hell deliberately created by Andrew since he was a child. She was his only salvation, which was why he had such a preference for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie felt very uneasy due to the strong sense of crisis. She immediately told him about the will.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Queenie, I know about the will. It's real. That's why you're part of the plan. I'm sorry. Once I have everything, we can be together openly.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was stunned. She stared at the message, her emotions complicated. It was all true. She was just a pawn. Steven didn't love her anymore. She feared he wouldn't even use her anymore. He said he loved her, but was he sincere?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie sneered. She still needed to hold the power in her own hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the past few years, she had taken advantage of Steven's connections and had finally achieved success.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Queenie left, Steven prepared for an international conference.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Except for Evan, no one knew what business Steven was involved in...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana had a fruitful night of diving. The next day at noon, she and Cecil returned to the island, loaded with catches.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige still had some loose ends to tie up and couldn't go back yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven finished his morning meeting and found out that Diana and Cecil had returned to the city together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He went to the dock only to find the weather had changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was sunny yesterday, but it was cold today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven looked at the nine photos Diana had posted online last night. She went diving at night and caught a lot of lobsters, crabs, and fish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He never knew she was such a good diver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's excellence began to show after she left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How many more talents did Diana have that he didn't know about?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana returned to the city and visited Joseph.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Priya was already awake and could eat some soft foods.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana brought some lobsters and asked Joseph to make a seafood soup for Priya.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Watching her put the lobsters in the fridge, Joseph smiled, his gaze following her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana turned to him and said, "Joseph, I brought several lobsters. You can eat them with your grandmother. There are also some cuttlefish. I brought you some seasonings. You can also cook for yourself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, thank you!" Joseph stared at her with tender eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was organizing things and didn't notice his passionate gaze.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="411.html">« Prev</a><a href="413.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
