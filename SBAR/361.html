Her style of dressing had completely changed as if she had matured overnight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But unbeknownst to Steven, Diana had grown up after experiencing death once.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, the taxi arrived, and Diana opened the door to get in. Steven told her to stay safe, but Diana ignored him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Such belated concern was unnecessary, as nobody needed it now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana couldn't afford to be generous. She couldn't read Steven's thoughts. In her mind, he might be pretending to please her while secretly doting on Queenie, something he was capable of doing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's resources had changed in this life, and she seemed very anxious now. However, Jace was very ambitious, and the Farley family was now out of their reach. This time, Cecil didn't fall into their trap. Because of Paula's actions, the Marsh family's company was in debt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Which family would be next to face a crisis?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It would still be the Farley family. Their overseas businesses were the most attractive to Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were fewer rules abroad compared to the country. Queenie had more capital abroad than at home, and her biggest resource was that man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana had a headache. Luna had been investigating, but there were still no clues.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven, I'm getting married, and I expect you to be there," Frank said, handing over the invitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven had to attend his wedding before they could cooperate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He took the invitation and looked at it, lost in thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, there were invitations for weddings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he and Diana got married, they only received the marriage license without any other ceremonial process.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Steven thought about this, he felt sorry for Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He replied, "Okay! I'll be there."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank smiled. "Thank you, Steven. Diana is too arrogant. She got in the way of you and Queenie..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Frank, just for the record, if I were to marry Queenie, I would lose my control over the company. You and your brothers all have business dealings with me. If I lost my position, you would also be out of business. You may want to be homeless, but I don't," Steven interrupted him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He then glanced coldly at Queenie. He was quite surprised at her close relationship with his father. He said, "Queenie, I had no idea that you were so close to my father."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="360.html">« Prev</a><a href="362.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
