The day he had pushed her down the stairs, his eyes ablaze with the same wild intensity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, go to hell. Look at how disgusting you look now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her figure trembled involuntarily, and she shoved Steven away with all her might. Her voice was hoarse as she said, "What are you doing? Don't touch me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven took two steps back, not missing the fear and evident hatred in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, I need to ask you something. Were you the one who saved me from the fire that year?" His voice was rough as he stared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was taken aback. Did he not even remember who saved him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had suffered his cruelty across two lifetimes, and indeed, he was utterly merciless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wasn't completely unconscious back then, so why couldn't he remember anything?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie had saved him once, and he always held onto the memory of Queenie's rescue, but hers faded into oblivion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was Queenie's act of saving his life, coupled with their bond as childhood sweethearts, that drove Steven to support Queenie with such fervor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Diana didn't need that; she would work hard on her own and defeat them fairly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She shook her head firmly. "It wasn't me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had no desire to entangle herself with him again, not even leveraging the fact that she once saved his life to bind him to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In this life, she never wanted anything to do with this man again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But why did he suddenly ask about this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had never mentioned it before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven observed her shaking her head. Her skin was flawlessly fair, and her eyes were as bright as stars. Her lips stood out in a vivid shade of red, enhancing her mesmerizing beauty that eclipsed Queenie's charm by a significant margin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven smiled bitterly, "So, to divorce me, you're denying you saved me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana pressed her lips together, saying nothing. She had accumulated too much disappointment and would no longer harbor any hope for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tears welled in her eyes, and she smiled sadly, "If I saved you, would you be grateful? I saved you, but you didn't let me go." He even didn't let her child go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She continued, "So, Steven, I never saved you." Diana refused to admit it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven strode over. He knew how massive the fire was that year, but he didn't understand why Queenie was in a villa in the suburbs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why was Diana there, too?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had certainly never seen Diana in backless clothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He took her hand, and with a slight tug, she fell into his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, an unprecedented sense of satisfaction made him reluctant to let her go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana struggled fiercely. "Steven, what are you doing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His deep voice rumbled in her ear, "Don't move if you don't want to get hurt."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He held her tighter and tighter, feeling an inexplicable satisfaction. He wanted to keep holding her like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana stopped moving. His voice seemed to have a magical power that made her cease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven suddenly lifted her shirt, revealing the scars on her back. Some had healed, but among them, a large scar stood out, stark and undeniable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven took a deep breath. She must have been in immense pain then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His voice trembled uncontrollably, "Diana, this is..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana pushed him away, coldly declaring, "It has nothing to do with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How can it have nothing to do with me? It was clearly you who saved me. Why won't you admit it?" Steven roared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana suddenly smiled, asking, "If I use the fact that I saved your life in that fire as leverage for our divorce, would you agree?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As long as he agreed to a divorce, she was ready to confess that she was the one who saved him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His pupils turned an intense scarlet as he spoke, "Do you really want to divorce me? To be with Alexander?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana nodded firmly. "Yes! Alexander trusts me without question. He's gentle, funny, and exactly my type. More importantly, my grandfather adores him. Remember, my grandfather was the most against me marrying you. And after how poorly you've treated me, he's been nothing but furious."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With his unyielding heart, Steven wouldn't love her just because she once saved his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana glanced outside, and what reflected in the window was his handsome silhouette.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She remembered him at twenty, clad in a white shirt, radiating youthfulness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was just starting to shine, and his charm and energy were undeniable, blessed with looks that made him the dream prince for countless girls. She also had fallen for him at first sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven smiled, "Diana, I've told you before, there will be no divorce. I won't let you run off to another man."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="269.html">« Prev</a><a href="271.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
