The man beside her reacted quickly, grabbing her arm. Her chest throbbed with pain, and she glared at Frank with red, tear-filled eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Frank, how dare you hit me? You're asking for death."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them exchanged a glance and attacked together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank wasn't physically strong. He never exercised. In a brawl, he was at a clear disadvantage. Elsie, fueled by fury, clawed at his face and jabbed her fingers into his eyes, making Frank cry out in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he managed to shove Elsie away, the man seized a metal rod nearby and drove it straight through Frank's thigh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The pain was so intense that Frank nearly passed out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man yanked the rod out with force, causing Frank to black out entirely from the unbearable pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie, witnessing the man's cruelty, was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a loud crash, the unconscious Frank was shoved overboard into the sea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man watched as Frank's body slowly sank into the water, a cold smile creeping across his face. "There are sharks around here. His blood will quickly attract them. Soon, there won't even be a trace of him left."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie, seeing the ruthless glint in the man's eyes, suddenly felt a wave of fear. "Would he kill me for the money, too? she wondered."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie swallowed hard, watching Frank's body gradually disappear into the sea. She said, "Hurry and get the boat, we can't let anyone see us. If we're seen, it's all over for us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man narrowed his eyes at her, his gaze filled with murderous intent. The few million dollars were more than enough for him to live comfortably for the rest of his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie felt a surge of fear as she noticed the malice in his eyes. She instinctively grew wary of the man. Staring at the spot where Frank had fallen into the sea, she realized she had miscalculated. Frank was the one who had treated her the best.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had been willing to spend money on her, willing to give her his time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she craved ice cream at two in the morning, he would go to a 24-hour store to get it for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she suffered from menstrual cramps, he'd massage her and gently comfort her to sleep. Every day, he'd find new ways to indulge her with good food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank had truly been kind to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she had destroyed all of that with her own hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tears streamed down Elsie's face as her heart filled with pain. She regretted it. Watching Frank sink into the sea, she truly regretted everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Frank, I'm sorry... I didn't mean to hurt you like this..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She cried uncontrollably, but Frank's figure had already vanished into the depths of the sea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She stared blankly at the calm waters, her heart filled with overwhelming regret and sorrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie let out a bitter laugh. If it hadn't been for that deal, she would never have let Frank go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He would have made a good husband, someone who would have loved her for a lifetime.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But for her, there were no second chances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Frank, I'm so sorry. I wronged you. If there's a next life, if I meet you again, I promise I'll love you properly... I swear..." she sobbed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Born into a poor family, she had been despised for being a girl since childhood. But she had forgotten all that pain, twisted into cruelty by the people around her. She had forgotten that she had once been a kind woman...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the same time, Diana had just caught a beautiful coral trout. Its flesh was incredibly tender, and Diana always considered this fish a rare delicacy. She loved eating it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Happily, she placed the fish in her net. On the way here, she had also spotted a large spider conch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She dove a second time to collect the spider conch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as she saw the conch, she smiled. It was a large one, heavy in her hand, and she was already planning how to prepare it for dinner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She swam upwards, brimming with excitement, and then she saw a man slowly sinking into the depths of the sea.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="382.html">« Prev</a><a href="384.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
