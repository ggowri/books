You unreasonable woman! Come back and save me!" the man yelled desperately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His vision was blurred. Thick fog surrounded him, obscuring everything. He could only hear Diana's voice, but he couldn't see her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the distance, he heard the faint sound of an ambulance. He silently prayed it was coming for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana gazed into the night. Snow fell heavily, shrouding the evening in hazy darkness. The cold winter air was dense with mist. Fireworks bloomed in the sky, their colors dreamlike against the veil of snow. Yet, the beauty of the scene did nothing to lift her spirits. Tears glimmered in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She took a deep breath, steadying herself. "It's Queenie and her man," she thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven faked his death and slipped away. Now it's her turn."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A soft chuckle escaped her lips. There was a trace of longing and resolve in her voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This time, she was determined. She wouldn't let herself fall so easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The police cars and ambulance arrived, their flashing lights cutting through the mist. Diana pointed toward the car, now almost submerged in the river. The rescue team wasted no time diving in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ten minutes later, they pulled the man from the freezing waters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana approached as the rescuers propped him up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He trembled uncontrollably, barely conscious. But the sight of her snapped him awake. "You... you devil!" he stammered, his voice shaking with fury. "Are you insane? I told you the truth, and you still threw me into the river! You vicious woman! No wonder people want to hire assassins to get rid of you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana sneered coldly, her eyes sharp as she glared at him. "I called for help to save you, and this is the thanks I get? You had it coming!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She crossed her arms and tilted her head mockingly. "I am a weak woman. Why should I risk my life to save someone trying to kill me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She winked at him, her expression playful yet provocative, as if daring him. "Come on, have a go. Try killing me if you can!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man froze, his face contorted with rage. He wanted to lunge at her but lacked the strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Every part of him ached, and he couldn't even stand without support.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana turned to the nearby officers. "Officers, this man tried to ram me with his car. But he drove himself into the river instead. Out of kindness, I called both the paramedics and the police, and now he's cursing me for it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man's head snapped up at her words. Spotting the police standing nearby, he burst into tears. "You might as well have let me drown! Attempted murder means jail time, and now the twenty grand is gone too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He sobbed hysterically. "That money was for my wedding. Without it, my fianc&eacute;e will leave me. You've ruined my life! You'll never be happy either, you wretched woman!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana rolled her eyes, exasperated. "You thought you'd be happy marrying with blood money? Do you think you deserve happiness? Enjoy your solitude in prison instead."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man nearly fainted from anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Luna handed the dashcam footage to the police. Once their statements were taken, Luna and Diana headed home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan received a call from a bodyguard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After hanging up, he and Steven headed to the apartment's underground garage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan turned to Steven. "Mr. Gellar, someone tried to harm Diana again tonight. But don't worry. She and Luna are safe at home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's eyes narrowed with fury. He looked at Evan. "It was Queenie and George. We need to dig into George's overseas company as soon as possible. Once we uncover his ties to the Mysterium Organization, we can act."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan nodded. "Understood."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A cold smile tugged at Steven's lips as he handed a bottle of pills to Evan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan glanced at it, confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's this, Mr. Gellar?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven smirked. "Slip this to George."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan's eyes lit up. "Wait... is this what I think it is?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's sinister grin widened. "Exactly. Queenie is insatiable. If George... can't keep up, she'll stray. She thrives on excitement. It's her way of coping with stress."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If George is out of the game, she'll look elsewhere. Their so-called love is just a charade.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It is a show of self-deception."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan raised an eyebrow. "Mr. Gellar, you're sharp when it comes to others' relationships. Why can't you see your own feelings? You clearly care about Diana. Why did you treat her that way?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan knew some wounds, once inflicted, could never be undone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven frowned, his voice icy. "Stop asking so many questions. Just handle this and get back quickly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan grinned. He enjoyed assignments like this. He opened the car's storage compartment, retrieving another vial of pills. Then, donning a lifelike disguise, he turned to Steven. "Mr. Gellar, I'll drop you off upstairs first. Then I'll head to the hospital."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven eyed the extra vial and Evan's mischievous grin. "What's that for?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nothing serious," Evan waved him off with a smile. These pills would help George and Queenie "calm down a bit."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't explain further. Diana's medical kit was like a treasure chest, packed with all sorts of medications neatly labeled with their effects and uses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To Evan, these pills would help George and Queenie "reflect deeply" on themselves, inside and out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven knew it couldn't be anything good, but he also trusted Evan to know his limits.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Be careful," Steven reminded him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course, Mr. Gellar. Don't worry about me," Evan replied cheerfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He quickly got out of the car, grabbed a wheelchair from the trunk, and unfolded it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Opening the car door, he pushed the wheelchair over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven braced himself with his hands and slowly settled into the seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan looked at Steven's legs and the exhaustion etched across his face, a pang of sadness tugging at his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Back when Steven couldn't walk, Diana had cared for him so attentively that Evan couldn't help but feel envious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He still couldn't understand why Steven didn't cherish her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a bright smile, Evan pushed Steven into the apartment. Once he'd seen him safely inside, he headed back down, hopped into the car, and drove off toward the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan's luck was impeccable. By the time he reached the hospital, Queenie and George were about to enjoy a late-night snack they'd ordered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since Queenie couldn't cook, George had no choice but to rely on takeout.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After eating, George felt a little queasy but brushed it off. He instructed his assistant to find a personal chef as soon as possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan, disguised as a janitor, entered their room under the pretense of cleaning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As fate would have it, George left to use the restroom, while Queenie had just received a phone call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing the janitor, Queenie could only push the wheelchair outside to take the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan seized the opportunity. He quickly spiked their food, then casually strolled out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Queenie returned, she and George sat down to eat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">George noticed Queenie's pale expression but didn't ask, not wanting to ruin his mood. Only after finishing his noodles did he ask, "What's the latest with Diana?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="974.html">« Prev</a><a href="976.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
