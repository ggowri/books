Is she dead?" Diana asked, sitting up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, how could you be so cruel? Queenie's face is almost ruined. She's supposed to start filming soon. Come here and apologize immediately, or I'll call the police," Frank yelled, his usual domineering self shining through.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suppressing her anger, Diana questioned, "Frank, she's done so many terrible things to me. If I wanted to harm her, do you think she'd still be alive?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why should I apologize for something I didn't do? Ask her if she dares to call the police."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do you mean? Why wouldn't Queenie dare to call the police? She's the victim," Frank replied in a harsh tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Diana couldn't help but feel envious of Queenie. Their three brothers cared about her deeply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They were willing to do anything for her, even things that could risk their own lives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Calmly, Diana said, "Frank, go ahead and ask Queenie to call the police and see if she dares. She's driven someone to death. Do you think she dares to involve the cops?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Diana hung up the phone and blocked Frank, then got up to take a bath. She was covered in sweat from the nightmare, feeling both physically and emotionally drained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After ending the call, Frank headed towards Queenie's ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie had applied some medication to her face last night, but the following day, her face was even more swollen. So, she came to the hospital for treatment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her face was nearly destroyed, leaving her no choice but to focus on the treatment before seeking revenge against the two men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hinted to Frank that the events of the previous night might have been set up by Diana. Upon hearing this, Frank wasted no time in calling Diana early the next morning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Queenie thought about her next move, Frank entered the room. "Queenie, Diana denied it," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Touching her swollen cheek, Queenie looked aggrieved. "Maybe it really wasn't her, but I haven't offended anyone else besides her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank snorted, his eyes turning red with anger. He hated Diana's vicious tricks. "Queenie, why don't we call the police and send her to jail? Only then will she learn her lesson and dare not set you up again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing the mention of involving the police, Queenie grew fearful, her face draining of color. "No, Frank, we can't call the police without evidence. Those two person fled, and the police couldn't catch them last night. Without proof, we can't bring her to justice. Frank, don't call the police, or Diana will only hate you even more."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was stunned. Diana was right. Queenie refused to call the police.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Could it be... No way. How could Queenie lie to me? It must have been Diana," he thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright. Get some rest. The doctor said your face is fine and will be fine after a few days of rest," Frank reassured her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie smiled and nodded gently. "Frank, thank you. You're all important to me. Ever since I found out that Diana is your biological sister, I've always felt insecure. Diana was jealous of me because she saw how well you treated me. It's all my fault. If it weren't for that mistake back then, you would have loved her instead of me. It's because of me that you drifted apart."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Queenie dropped her head and started to cry, appearing vulnerable and pitiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank's heart ached at Queenie's words. He sat beside her on the bed, speaking in a comforting tone, "Queenie, please don't cry. You are our only sister, and that will never change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I will never accept Diana. She is so wicked."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hatred flickered in Frank's eyes as he thought about how their family would have been happy if Jeff hadn't brought Diana back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Apart from sharing the same blood, Diana meant nothing to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie, we won't call the police. That would be letting her off too easily," Frank said.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="282.html">« Prev</a><a href="284.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
