I carried her to the car, but the car was stuck in traffic just a few minutes after leaving the house."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana touched her belly and found that the fetus was in an abnormal position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pressed her lips and quickly thought of a first-aid plan in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know how to deliver a baby? Why are you daydreaming? Hurry up and deliver the baby. If anything happens to Carolyn, I will make you pay for it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp and sarcastic voice came from the back seat, and Diana realized that there was another woman in the back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She frowned slightly and glanced at her, and the woman was looking at Diana with murderous intent on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was checking Carolyn's situation and ignored her. Instead, Sam, next to her, yelled with red eyes, "Janet Young, shut up or get out of here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet was also furious as she looked at Carolyn, who had fainted. With disdain, she said, "She</span><span>'</span><span>s so useless, fainting just from walking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Janet, get out of here! Don't make me say it a second time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam's eyes were bloodshot from anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, yes, yes, you are a good person. You treat this bumpkin as a treasure. It's really shameful. She can even fall down while walking. If my nephew dies, her worthless life cannot be compensated."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana heard the harsh voice and derogatory words, and her eyes were stern. "Shut up. She is in a very bad condition. If you want to quarrel, </span><span>just go away</span><span>. Don't disturb me to save her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Save her?" Janet smiled wryly and said in a mocking tone, "</span><span>Y</span><span>ou are so young, you don't </span><span>even </span><span>know how to save her</span><span>, right?</span><span> You </span><span>just </span><span>think Sam is handsome, so you want to win his attention</span><span> by doing this.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a pity that you chose the wrong time. Sam is very worried about Carolyn and even more worried about the baby in her belly. You'd better save your energy and don't embarrass yourself in public."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned and looked at Sam, saying sternly, "I advise you to take her out of the car and don't interfere with my rescue. Your wife didn't just slip. She was drugged, and she and the child are in danger. If you trust me, let me save her quietly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Diana finished speaking, Janet immediately started cursing, "Bitch, </span><span>are you really a doctor</span><span>? Isn't it just a pregnant woman slipping? How did you link it to poisoning?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at her guilty look and said in a steady voice, "How do you know she slipped and was not poisoned? Were you at the scene?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were dressed elegantly and drove a limited edition luxury car. Diana knew they weren't nobodies. Rich people were masters at playing tricks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The malice in Janet's eyes could not be hidden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet was slightly stunned, her eyes dodging. "I...I wasn't there, and I heard it from Sam..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you weren't at the scene, shut up, unless you don't want Carolyn to live. You've been trying to stop me from the beginning, and I have every reason to suspect that you poisoned her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana would also turn the tables. Janet was too mean and would never end unless she was stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she was fifteen or sixteen years old, she would have gone crazy if she met a woman like Janet, but now she could only deal with it calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Janet, if you dare to say one more word, I will bankrupt your company and your boyfriend's company completely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet was instantly shocked by Sam's offish words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She widened her eyes and didn't dare to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana then took out an antidote from her bag and gave it to Carolyn to drink. She had been drugged and fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet watched Diana feed Carolyn medicine and frowned slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sam looked at </span><span>his wife</span><span> nervously.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="858.html">« Prev</a><a href="860.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
