She smiled with relief, looking radiant under the sunset. "After I leave, I want to let Steven and Queenie have their way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana, having lived a second life, realized that ghosts were not the scariest thing in the world; human hearts were.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea felt relieved that Diana was able to let go. Queenie was always scheming, never wanting Diana to return and take back her position as the heiress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's selfishness and malice were truly appalling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I never liked Queenie. She was always causing trouble, bringing her clique to school to bully and taunt me. You know, back then, I didn't care about my appearance. I had glasses, was awkward, and could do nothing but study.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But as a student, what else could I do besides study?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I saw through Queenie's hypocrisy early on, but the Marsh family and Steven couldn't. Even my mom didn't want me to be around her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After that incident, my parents gave Gale one last chance, which was also my last chance to let go completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Gale insisted that we framed him and made him betray his goddess, Penelope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"At that moment, I gave up. Let him and his goddess be together forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My brother hated Gale, so we moved overnight. When I got pregnant, my mom wanted me to get an abortion, but I refused. The child is innocent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Parents can't always win against their children. I kept the baby, and things are fine now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea smiled at Diana as she continued, "Diana, I thought I'd be devastated after leaving Gale. After all, I'd been chasing after him since childhood, and everyone called me his 'lapdog.' I guess they were right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But it's been almost nine months since I left him, and I'm doing well. Anyone can live without anyone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't others who couldn't let go of her. It was herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana understood. She ate a lobster, smiling with contentment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Althea, I get it. It's been almost half a year since I left Steven. I'm happy now, back with Grandpa and my brothers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"For the rest of our lives, we won't need to please anyone because we're valuable ourselves."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea smiled. If they had understood this sooner, they wouldn't have been hurt so deeply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After dinner, Althea took Diana for a walk by the seaside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The seaside was beautiful at night. Diana took some photos and posted them on Instagram.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She spent the night with Althea. Besides Olivia, she also had Althea as her close friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day was sunny, and Althea arranged for a handsome diving instructor to take Diana lobster hunting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana could dive on her own, but Althea wasn't comfortable letting her go alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After giving instructions, Althea went to work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The noon sun was pleasant, and the sea was blue. Diana took a few selfies with the handsome instructor and posted a collage with the caption, "In the future, every day will be this happy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven had no news of Diana yesterday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He sat in his office, his expression dark. Diana hadn't answered her phone last night. Where could she have gone?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He dialed the intercom and asked Evan to come in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan was busy, and Edison was handling overseas matters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan was running around, busy with the search for a designer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Gellar, is there something you need?" Evan asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven asked grimly, "Where is Diana?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan looked confused. "Mr. Gellar, how would I know where Ms. Bishop is?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven frowned. "Diana's phone isn't reachable. Find out where she is."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="253.html">« Prev</a><a href="255.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
