It was Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought, "Why is he here too?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He ran into Queenie. Wow. The fun is about to begin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana walked over lightly and listened to the two talking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was very surprised that Steven would take the initiative to see Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was something that had never happened before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven only came to Queenie and did not take the initiative to meet Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was just Queenie's substitute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Queenie left, Diana accompanied Steven for two years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was unbelievable. Her eyes were full of anger. How could he take the initiative to come to Diana. She said, "Steven, why are you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at Queenie's aggressive look with cold eyes. "What are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words extinguished all the expectations and wishes in Queenie's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Steven, I'm here to see Diana."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why? You look angry. Are you here to bully her?" Steven's expression became gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's purpose of coming here was very simple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana ruined Amelie's plan. They were unwilling to accept the failure of their plan, so Queenie came to find Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gradually figured out Queenie's tactics.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was already feeling wronged today, and at this moment, she couldn't stop crying. "Steven, you wouldn't treat me like this before. You loved me so much before. Why did you change now? Don't forget that I saved your life in the fire that year."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven said, "I have never forgotten your kindness in saving my life. The money I gave you over the years is enough, not to mention that back then..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, if you want to flirt, go somewhere else. Don't stand in front of my office door."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana quickly interrupted Steven. The relationship between them could not be made clear yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Steven found out that it was not Queenie who saved him, his attitude suddenly changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He began to care about Diana. But what she wanted to do was not yet done, so Steven could not say it now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at her, frowning slightly, with a hint of displeasure in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked sideways into Diana's office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven caught a glimpse of her disgusted look and felt uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given the current situation between the two, Diana didn't believe him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana seemed to have returned to her original state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's expression was stern. "Why don't you wait for me to come back with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana found his words incomprehensible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Why should I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven said, "I went to the police station."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "I didn't see you. Just leave. I have to start working."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven stared at her with his deep eyes. "Honey, are you trying to drive me away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shuddered. "Honey? You don't deserve to call me that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven held his temper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie, who was standing at the door, became upset.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, you called her honey. What should I do?" Queenie couldn't believe it. She had been very busy during this period. Unknowingly, Steven had already been so close to Diana.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="828.html">« Prev</a><a href="830.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
