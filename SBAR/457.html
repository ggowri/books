Give her a bit of time. She might come through and fix that two billion loss."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, I went to the police station this morning to see her. She wouldn't say a single word! It's driving me crazy! How did I end up keeping such an ungrateful brat? Even a dog would show us more loyalty, and here I am, stuck with a scorpion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm giving her ten days to pay up. If she doesn't come through by then, I'll push for court action to get my money back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard Jane's husband is a total slacker. If he finds out she's sitting on 200 million, she's in for a world of hurt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie frowned, never one to underestimate Paula.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew the woman was sharp in business and had picked up quite a bit from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, it's just ten days, right? Let's hold off a little longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, she must've lost her mind! There are too many bad people out there. It's hard to keep an eye on everyone. You've got to be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie felt her stomach drop. Paula's words were hitting too close to home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I get it, Mom. I have things to handle, so I'll hang up now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay! Just stay safe, Queenie!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once she hung up, Paula's expression twisted into a sinister smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "You little brat, you think you can outsmart me in this financial game? Think again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within ten days, Queenie would have to pay back that two billion no matter who was backing her. She would make sure every penny came back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing by the window, Paula looked out at the world, feeling heavy-hearted. For the sake of the company and her parents' hard work, she'd sacrificed everything, even her four sons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remembered her younger self, brave enough to have five kids.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff had no decency left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cared for no one but himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For money, he'd throw anyone under the bus, including his mistresses and Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After slapping her last time, the next step was to make Queenie cry and run to Jeff for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was time to cut off her money flow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula narrowed her eyes, realizing she needed to have an honest talk with Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Diana held grudges, longing for her mother's affection, while Paula had pushed her own daughter away, raising a bunch of good-for-nothings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom." Eric limped into the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula turned, her eyes cold. "What do you want? Get out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He froze, shocked by her icy demeanor. "Mom, what's up with that? I was just planning to teach Diana a lesson! She's totally fine, right? Is it really that big of a deal for you to freak out on me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring him, she went back to her desk and picked up the intercom. "Linda, announce on the company website that I'm cutting ties with Eric because he's a disgrace. He sent his own sister to another man to be trampled on. He doesn't deserve to be my son. Make sure it's clear."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric was stunned. He hurried over and grabbed the phone. "Linda, wait! I need to talk to my mom first!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="456.html">« Prev</a><a href="458.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
