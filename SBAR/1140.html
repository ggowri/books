It hit him&mdash;he had never taken Diana to a banquet before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What had he been thinking back then? He wanted her to stay low-key, to avoid drawing anyone's attention.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as Charlie didn</span><span>'</span><span>t notice her, she would be safe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled, taking her hand gently. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Back then, I had my reasons. I wanted you to stay under the radar, to keep Charlie from realizing how I felt about you. By treating Queenie well, I kept him in check, stopped him from sabotaging the company. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>I'm sorry, Diana. At that time, I couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t afford to have feelings for you. With Queenie, it was all an act, but sometimes..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sometimes, though, pretending can feel real. You did have feelings for her, didn</span><span>'</span><span>t you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana pulled her hand back, wrapping her arms around her knees.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought about it but couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t let go of the past. Every time it crossed her mind, the pain resurfaced.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm not going. I hate those parties. You go," Diana said stubbornly. She stared blankly at the marble tabletop, her blurred reflection staring back. She was clearly unhappy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven pressed his lips together slightly. Every time the past was mentioned, her mood soured, and she just couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t let it go.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fine! I</span><span>'</span><span>m not going either. Let Evan handle it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He just wanted to stay by her side.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at him and smiled. "Steven, why aren</span><span>'</span><span>t you going? It</span><span>'</span><span>s a business networking event. You might get plenty of opportunities there. You can</span><span>'</span><span>t just skip it. Go ahead. If you need a date, find one."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm not in a good mood today. I can't go with you. If I'm unhappy, it won't be good for you either."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana gave a faint smile. She was breathtakingly beautiful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But it was a beauty tinged with sorrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's heart clenched painfully. Seeing her bittersweet smile, thinking of all the hardships and injustices she had endured, it tore at him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even without growing up in the Marsh family, she was still a proud and stunning heiress. If she wanted, countless men would gladly offer her their hearts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in this girl's heart, there had always been only him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had let down her unwavering devotion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It</span><span>'</span><span>s fine. Without you by my side, what</span><span>'</span><span>s the point of making all that money? There</span><span>'</span><span>s no one to help me spend it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana caught the hint of sulkiness in his words and couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t help but chuckle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What do you mean no one spends your money? I</span><span>'</span><span>ll do it! And if I can</span><span>'</span><span>t use it all, we</span><span>'</span><span>ll donate the rest to an orphanage."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Every year, I buy clothes and school supplies for kids, just so they can feel loved too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No matter how much love they feel, every time I buy something for the kids, it makes me happy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "Alright! Every winter, we</span><span>'</span><span>ll do charity together. We</span><span>'</span><span>ll personally shop for everything and deliver it to the orphanage ourselves."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nodded, "Mm-hmm!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She took a deep breath. The ache in her heart eased significantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm sorry, Steven. I never meant to bring you down. But every time the past comes up, I just can't let it go."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hated this side of herself too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wanted to let go of the past and live her life. But every time it resurfaced, she couldn't help dragging others into her emotions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven suddenly pulled her up, placing her on his lap.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their position was far too intimate, making Diana a little nervous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since she got sick, Steven always held her while they slept. She'd grown used to it, though they hadn't taken things any further.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana pressed her hands against his shoulders, her eyes full of caution. "What are you doing?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven chuckled, a mix of anger and amusement in his voice. "Diana, if I really wanted to do something to you, do you think you could get away?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She quietly stared at his handsome face. She really did love that face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't you dare!" Diana warned him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smirked and pinched the soft flesh at her waist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stiffened, her back straight as she glared at him. "You... you stop that!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead of stopping, Steven leaned in and planted a kiss on her cheek.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In a husky voice, he said, "Diana, do you really think I have no desires? Do you know why I</span><span>'</span><span>ve kept my distance? Because once I touch you, I</span><span>'</span><span>m afraid I</span><span>'</span><span>ll lose control. I</span><span>'</span><span>ve been holding back, trying not to hurt you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You underestimate your allure. You have no idea how hard it is to hold back when I</span><span>'</span><span>m holding you at night&mdash;soft, warm, and intoxicatingly sweet. Baby, I</span><span>'</span><span>m waiting for your forgiveness. Only when you truly forgive me, when our souls align, can we find real happiness together."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had always thought it was her lack of charm, assuming Steven had no interest in her that way.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Steven hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t admitted today that he desired her, she would</span><span>'</span><span>ve kept doubting herself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If a man truly likes a woman, his first thought is always desire&mdash;everything else comes after.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana lowered her head, resting her forehead against his. She was in a great mood.  </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, I</span><span>'</span><span>m so happy. Tonight, I</span><span>'</span><span>ll go to the party with you. Let</span><span>'</span><span>s drive Queenie mad."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He frowned slightly but ultimately said nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her jealousy was a good thing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright! Then I'll take you to buy a dress."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stood up and said, "Let's go. I could use some fresh air anyway."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing her mood improve, Steven couldn't help but smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana went upstairs to change her clothes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After she came down, Steven took her to a luxury mall to shop for a dress.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's company owned many high-end brands, but today he wanted to show her some international luxury labels.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, the two arrived at the mall.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven held Diana</span><span>'</span><span>s hand as he led her toward the store he had in mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a high-end luxury mall&mdash;quiet, spacious, and dripping with opulence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they reached the boutique, Steven turned to her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Diana, the gowns here are really nice. See anything you like?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana recognized the brand immediately. She gave a mysterious little smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Steven, don</span><span>'</span><span>t you know whose name this store operates under?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven paused for a second, slightly caught off guard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tall frame cast a shadow over her petite figure as he smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Is it part of Azure Group?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked proud.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Nope. It</span><span>'</span><span>s actually a fashion brand I co-founded with an overseas partner. I do the sketches, and they handle the production in their country. And just like that, a luxury brand was born.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced around with a sparkle in her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Most of the clothes here are my designs. But if you want something truly unique, go check out the boutique across the aisle. That designer</span><span>'</span><span>s a good friend of mine. His work is just as stunning.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Steven took her hand and pulled her toward the other store.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana picked out a champagne-colored gown.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shade flattered her fair skin, making her look effortlessly radiant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was about to say something, a woman</span><span>'</span><span>s voice suddenly rang out behind them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I want the dress she</span><span>'</span><span>s holding. Wrap it up for me.</span><span>"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1139.html">« Prev</a><a href="1141.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
