Jeff had already met his retribution. What was meant to happen had already happened. She was living a good life. She explained, "No. Let's go home. I'm not upset. But Hubery still ignores me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna replied, "Well!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was about to drive away when Diana's phone suddenly rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She picked it up and saw that it was Cecil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cecil," she smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you're back. I want to invite you to dinner. I know you're off work," Cecil chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glanced out the car window and spotted his car parked opposite them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He beamed brightly and waved. "Diana, I'm here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said, "Sure. Send me the address, and I'll ask Luna to take me there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil replied, "Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana hung up the phone and soon received a message from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sent the address to Luna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna drove over. Cecil showed up just in time. Diana was dejected, and she would feel better if he kept her company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The restaurant he chose was quite a distance away, near the radio and television building. It took them forty minutes to reach their destination due to the rush-hour traffic jam.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After getting out of the car, Diana put on a black coat with a black business suit underneath, looking very capable.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She went to the door in the snow and wind and saw Cecil already there waiting for her.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately opened the windproof curtain for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, there's a traffic jam. Are you hungry?" he asked with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was dressed very maturely in black trousers, a black shirt, and a black woolen coat, which added to his calm and steady appearance.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first time Diana had seen him appear like a domineering president.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cecil, you are different today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil's ears blushed instantly. He was somewhat embarrassed. To make himself more mature, he wore clothes he did not normally wear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't like suits, but casual clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, do you like me dressed like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana chuckled and shook her head honestly. "The outfit is very mature, but I prefer your previous dressing style."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the workplace, there were not so many requirements now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Except for very important banquets, everyone dressed casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil's charming eyes were bright and tender. "I just wanted to dress myself up a little more maturely, but unexpectedly, you didn't like me in this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was stunned that he had changed his dressing style for her, but she didn't think much about it. "Maturity doesn't depend on clothes. Let's go. Where are we going?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil replied, "It's here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was too low for Diana to hear.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He trotted after her and said with a smile, "Diana, let's go to the sixth floor. There is a casserole restaurant. I've made a reservation in advance, and now it's just the right time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said, "Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, she liked his attractive, youthful appearance.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They took the elevator to the sixth floor. The environment was great, with many restaurant waiters handing out flyers at the door.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The atmosphere was lively. Diana was very fond of such places. It was nosy, but it made her feel like she was living a real life.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="619.html">« Prev</a><a href="621.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
