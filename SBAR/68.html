Her long legs were perfect and she looked confident.</p><p>And the moment when she smiled just made Steven unable to take his eyes away.</p><p>How Diana <span style="color:#222222"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="background-color:#ffffff">suddenly became so brilliant after leaving</span></span></span> him?</p><p>Steven realized that he didn&#x27;t understand Diana at all. She was well-behaved and sensible. After marrying him, she didn&#x27;t cause any trouble.</p><p>Except for complaining about his close relationship with Queenie, she did very well as a wife.</p><p>But now Diana was charming as if she had become a different person.</p><p>Diana also felt annoyed when he saw Steven.</p><p>Before the divorce, it was difficult for them to see each other.</p><p>But now, after their divorce, she saw him every day.</p><p>She was wearing high heels, with steady steps and an elegant temperament. Standing under the lights, she was as dazzling as a star, exuding charm that catch everyone’s eyes.</p><p>She was like a queen in the workplace, perfectly displaying her wisdom.</p><p>Steven narrowed his eyes and said,</p><p>&quot;Come home with me and stop making trouble. I wronged you before. I apologize. I&#x27;m sorry!&quot;</p><p>Diana was speechless.</p><p>She was so angry that she even laughed and said,</p><p>&quot;Steven, didn&#x27;t I tell you? You didn’t even get to apologize. Don&#x27;t apologize, you don&#x27;t deserve it!&quot;</p><p>&quot;We&#x27;re divorced, please stay away from me.&quot;</p><p>Diana was wondering how could she get rid of this scumbag.</p><p>&quot;Diana, I&#x27;ve already apologized to you, what else do you want?&quot; Steven frowned.</p><p>He was arrogant and had never apologized to anyone.</p><p>Diana smiled and looked extremely attractive.</p><p>&quot;Steven, how much have I been wronged in the past? Do you think I can forgive you just because of your apology?&quot;</p><p>It’s not that easy. You want to enjoy having two women around you. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t do that.</p><p>You should go and complete the final procedure quickly, and then marry your beloved woman.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Queenie and you are truly a perfect match.&quot;</p><p>She showed him her slender fingers, laughed and mocked, &quot;Steven, do you know how ridiculous is our marriage? When I married you, I didn&#x27;t even have a wedding ring.</p><p>Do you think I would want such a marriage?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Would I want a stupid man like you?&quot;</p><p>Diana looked cold and said, &quot;Get as far away from me as you can.&quot;</p><p>This time, she just wanted to enjoy her life.</p><p>Steven was stunned. She was right. He wanted to use her in their marriage from the very beginning.</p><p>She knew it clearly but still agreed.</p><p>He didn&#x27;t even buy her a wedding ring.</p><p>&quot;Diana, if you like rings, I will take you to buy it tomorrow.&quot; He knew he owed her.</p><p>Diana looked at him in confusion. Her eyes were so beautiful. When she looked at the man, she seemed to be seducing him. But she was not.</p><p>&quot;Steven, how many times do I have to tell you before you understand that you and I have no future together, and I don&#x27;t want you anymore?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Queenie was your future wife. Don&#x27;t let her down or forget your motivation for cheating on me.</p><p>Queenie, whom you desperately protect and spent billions of dollars to settle the mistakes she made, is the perfect woman for you.&quot;</p><p>After Diana finished speaking, she strode away.</p><p>Steven wanted to chase after her but Luna stopped him immediately,</p><p>&quot;Mr. Gellar, Ms. Bishop is very tired today, please leave her alone.&quot;</p><p>Steven frowned and looked angry.</p><p>Looking at Diana&#x27;s back thoughtfully, he realized that she didn&#x27;t want to go back with him.</p><p>Luna saw he didn&#x27;t move, and then she left.</p><p>Steven watched Diana get into the luxury car on the roadside. Luna got into the cab, and the two left.</p><p>Steven&#x27;s hand hanging by his side clenched slightly. Diana misunderstood him too much.</p><p>He took a deep breath, turned around, and saw Owen standing behind him.</p><p>Owen smiled and said, &quot;Steven, Evan told me what happened recently. If it was me, I would never forgive you either.</p><p>I heard that you gave the land in the west to Cecil to save Queenie last night. The Farley family has been growing in recent years.</p><p>You didn&#x27;t give your ex-wife a penny but spent a lot of money on Queenie. Even I would think you loved Queenie.&quot;</p><p>Steven frowned and said, &quot;You don&#x27;t understand, Queenie and I grew up together...&quot;</p><p>Steven suddenly stopped.</p><p>Thinking of what Queenie had done recently, he decided to help her the last time last night.</p><p>&quot;Last night was the last time, and it won&#x27;t happen again,&quot; Steven said and left, but thinking of Diana&#x27;s desolate eyes, he felt very uncomfortable.</p><p>Owen looked at Steven&#x27;s back and shook his head slightly. Owen didn&#x27;t believe that this would be the last time.</p><p>But he believed that Diana would never look back.</p><p>Steven had grown up in darkness and didn&#x27;t understand love.</p><p>He only knew that Queenie grew up with him and was like his family member.</p><p>If something happened to her, he would be the first to protect her.</p><p>Owen chased after him and said something that dealt a fatal blow to Steven,</p><p>&quot;Steven, even if she grew up with you, how can you help outsiders bully your wife? Even if there is evidence in front of you, you should listen to your wife&#x27;s explanation.</p><p>&quot;Listen to me. Diana will never turn back.&quot;</p><p>Steven clenched his hands tightly and felt annoyed.</p><p>&quot;Let&#x27;s go and have dinner.&quot; To wait for Diana, he had not had dinner yet.</p><p>The dull pain in his stomach made him feel uncomfortable.</p><p>Owen walked over leisurely and followed Steven into the car, and Evan started the car.</p><p>Steven said, &quot;Let&#x27;s go to the private restaurant in front.&quot;</p><p>Evan said, &quot;Okay.&quot;</p><p>Owen sat there playing with his phone and didn&#x27;t continue the previous topic.</p><p>Once Steven made up his mind, nothing could change it, and Owen didn&#x27;t want to say anything and make Steven unhappy.</p><p>Owen&#x27;s eyes deepened. He found Diana was very beautiful tonight. Her beauty was breathtaking.</p><p>He knew the reason why Steven married Diana, and it was a wrong start.</p><p>Steven sat in silence. His eyes slightly narrowed. No one knew what he was thinking.</p><p>The cell phone buzzed. Steven looked down and saw that it was Queenie calling.</p><p>Steven hung up without hesitation.</p><p>He thought of what Diana said, &quot;As long as Queenie calls you, you will always put her before me.&quot;</p><p>She was ill before, but when he was called away by Queenie, why didn&#x27;t she tell him then?</p><p>Steven was very annoyed and closed his eyes.</p><p>In the Marsh Villa.</p><p>Queenie called Steven several times today, but Steven just didn&#x27;t answer.</p><p>She was very anxious. She had been fought back by Diana several times, and Steven also saw her true face. She wondered if Steven had believed in Diana instead.</p><p>Queenie was so anxious that she almost cried. Seeing Jeff coming downstairs, she shouted anxiously,</p><p>&quot;Dad, Steven doesn&#x27;t answer my calls now, what should I do?&quot;</p><p>When Jeff heard this, he also felt a sense of crisis.</p><p>Steven had never treated Queenie like this. Usually, whenever Queenie called, he would come to see Queenie even when he was busy.</p><p>She wondered if these two incidents had made Steven see the truth and pushed him to believe Diana.</p><p>Jeff was also very angry and said, &quot;Why did Diana suddenly become so powerful?&quot;</p><p>Queenie looked vicious and shook her shoulders angrily, saying,</p><p>&quot;How can I expect that? In the past, she rarely refuted anything we said, and she would bear it silently when she was wronged. Now she is powerful...&quot;</p><p>She didn&#x27;t know why Diana suddenly became powerful as if she was a different person.</p><p>Cecil knew that she had tricked him this time, so he would secretly revenge on her.</p><p>The more Queenie thought about it, the more annoyed she became. She sat on the sofa and threw the pillow to the ground. She decided to win Steven back.</p><p>Steven was willing to do anything for her. Steven grew up with her, their relationship was closer than that of he and Diana.</p><p>Seeing Queenie was unhappy, Jeff felt distressed and said, &quot;Let&#x27;s think about whether we have any evidence against Diana that can make Steven change his mind.&quot;</p><p>Queenie thought about it, and suddenly, she said excitedly, &quot;Alexander. Didn&#x27;t Diana go on a blind date with Alexander? Diana and Steven haven&#x27;t divorced yet, so Diana is cheating on Steven.&quot;</p><p>Jeff shook his head and said, &quot;No, this is too risky. By then, the person who cheated might be Steven, and you will become the mistress.</p><p>What Steven did to you is known by everyone, and it is easy to drag you into the storm. You will have a piano competition soon, and you can&#x27;t ruin your reputation.</p><p>As for Diana, there are plenty of opportunities for us to deal with her. Find an opportunity to make Steven and Diana divorce completely.&quot;</p><p>Queenie bit her lips angrily. She had never been so sad before.</p><p>Steven ignored her, which made her very nervous and scared. She still had a lot of things to do.</p><p>Jeff rarely had a few days of free time and didn&#x27;t want to worry about this matter. &quot;Queenie, I will go to discuss this matter with your mother. I won&#x27;t be back these two days. You can have fun by yourself.</p><p>Gale will be back in two days. He also hates Diana very much. You can use him to deal with Diana then.&quot;</p><p>When Queenie heard this, she smiled and said, &quot;Dad, after we use him this time, we should get rid of him. Everything here will be left to Tobias and me.&quot;</p><p>Jeff&#x27;s eyes narrowed. After all, Gale was his son.</p><p>But all of them were useless.</p><p>None of them made him worry-free.</p><p>&quot;Gale is no threat to Noah...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Dad, can you stop being soft-hearted? It&#x27;s because of your soft-heartedness that my mother has been suffering, and I have become an adopted daughter and an illegitimate daughter.</p><p>Do you want me to live in disgrace for the rest of my life?&quot;</p><p>She must be the legitimated daughter of the Marsh family.</p><p>She had already thought of a solution.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="67.html">« Prev</a><a href="69.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
