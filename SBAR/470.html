He was grinning at her with a wicked smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frowning, Diana realized he had done this on purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't recognize him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blurry vision clouded her mind, and a wave of pain washed over her as she lay sprawled on the hood, desperately trying to piece together who he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quick, call for an ambulance!" shouted an officer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two police officers rushed over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing them, Diana felt a flicker of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain was overwhelming, but she managed to speak. "Please, take me to Tanaxes Hospital. Thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, she fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A reporter was on the scene covering the traffic accident. He captured the moment and quickly posted it online.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver, a young man, stepped out of the car. The reporter asked him, "Sir, why did you hit that woman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered, "My brakes failed. I'm so sorry. But I can offer her a million dollars in compensation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His arrogance was palpable, even infuriating the reporter. The man's indifference to the situation was shocking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reporter took a look at the luxury car, assuming he was powerful, and it was no wonder he was so arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, don't you care about the victim's condition?" the reporter asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a malicious smirk, the man replied, "Whatever happens, happens. If she dies from that crash, that's her bad luck. I'm only responsible for the money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man still maintained his arrogant attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This incident instantly became a trending topic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Cecil also saw the news and found that it was his cousin, Samuel Farley, who had hit Diana. He was at home, getting ready for a party when he exploded, "Grandma, Samuel has gone too far!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rita glanced at the smug Samuel on the screen and replied, "Cecil, your Uncle Wyatt has always coveted the heir position. For years, he's been scheming for it. If Diana hadn't interfered with our family affairs, who do you think would be the main beneficiary?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil's eyes widened in realization. "Grandma, if Diana hadn't intervened, Queenie would have taken over, and the biggest beneficiaries would have been Uncle Wyatt and his family," he said, appearing horrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rita nodded, pleased with Cecil's insight. "Exactly. If it weren't for Diana's help, you and your father could have been in serious trouble. Wyatt would have swooped in and aligned with Queenie, and the Farley family would have been doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Look at Samuel's arrogance. He hit Diana on purpose. But what was she doing on the highway in the first place?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="469.html">« Prev</a><a href="471.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
