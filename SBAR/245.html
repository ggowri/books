"How did you provoke Mr. Farley? From what I know of him, as long as you don't bother him, he won't make things difficult for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Living in the same city, he was familiar with Cecil's character.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's gaze was cold, devoid of the usual warmth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie knew it was related to the incident at Rita's banquet. She shifted the blame onto Diana. "It's all because of Diana... What happened at Mrs. Farley's banquet..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, Queenie! Besides scheming against Diana, blaming her, then crying to Steven, is there anything else you can do?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What does this have to do with Diana? You know exactly what you've done to get to this point. Even if you drag Steven into this, do you think I&rsquo;ll fear you?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You&rsquo;re a mistress, and that gold-digging father of yours... The Marsh family really is something."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Cecil, don't go too far," Queenie snapped, her pretty eyes flashing with a hint of menace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil laughed arrogantly. "Too far? This is just the start. You want to trend on social media? I'll make you famous as a mistress."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You..." Queenie was at a loss for words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil turned to Steven, his face full of contempt. "Two timing scum. You think you can have two women? In your dreams! Hurry up and divorce Diana, so I can pursue her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven frowned, his eyes flashing coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie laughed angrily. "So, Mr. Farley is here to defend Diana? Haven't you heard the saying? The one who isn't loved is the mistress."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"True, but you're the legitimate mistress here," Cecil retorted, his voice deep with scorn. Cecil raised an eyebrow, smiling slightly. His pleasant voice carried a hint of mockery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's face turned pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He shoved Steven. "Scum, get out of the way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie stomped her foot in frustration. "Steven, why didn't you help me just now? Did you see how arrogant Cecil was? What kind of spell did Diana cast on him? He's causing trouble for me because of her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's brown eyes were cold as he asked, "You don't know why he's after you? Have you forgotten what happened with Madam Farley? Why is everything always Diana's fault?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie froze. Was he defending Diana?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her voice turned softer. "Steven, I didn't do anything. You heard Cecil. He's causing trouble for me because of Diana."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked pitiful, on the verge of tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven turned and walked away. His striking face was stern, his jawline sharp, his eyes cold as ice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Watching his impatient figure, Queenie let out a cold laugh. "Steven, your love for me was never worth much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Men really are unreliable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale had sent someone to Tanaxes Hospital to gather information and learned that Diana's surgery on the patient was a success.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He felt unexpectedly thrilled. Diana's medical skills were truly impressive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had come to terms with the truth. Queenie, Penelope, and his biological father had all been plotting against him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wouldn't go abroad. Who knew what might happen if he did?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It dawned on him later. His father sent him abroad, where the language barrier made things harder, just to make his life more miserable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale's eyes were filled with deep hatred. He wanted revenge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, the door to the hospital room was pushed open.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="244.html">« Prev</a><a href="246.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
