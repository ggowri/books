Queenie smiled helplessly, "I was forced to leave by your mom back then, and you know how crazy she was, so how dare I stay?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I wanted to stay and take care of you when you had an accident, but my father insisted that Diana should marry you. I'm just an adopted daughter, and you know my situation better than anyone."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie cried in a low voice, looking aggrieved.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, the woman was in a mental institution after Queenie made her insane.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one could stop Queenie from wanting what she wanted, and Steven had to marry her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wouldn't go back to that man again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She could see that only Steven truly loved her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was also helpless when he thought about his mother's temper.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go. I'll have Evan drive you back."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without waiting for Queenie to say anything, Steven strode out the door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was instantly upset when she heard that Evan would drive her back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was usually Steven who personally drove her back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie reluctantly caught up with Steven and pouted, "Steven, you used to drive me back, but why don't you do it today? Are you worried about Diana?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you're worried about her, I'll remind you now that we are separated because of Diana, and it is also because of her appearance. You're the one who betrayed me to be with her..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's enough. You left me on your own back then, and I never had a relationship with you, so there was no betrayal between us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I had to marry Diana under the threat of my grandpa. You should go home first, and I don't want to hear any more of that later."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The annoyance in Steven's eyes became increasingly obvious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was stunned, thinking, "We're not in a relationship, so there's no betrayal.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Right. Steven never said he was going to marry me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Steven had never spoken to me in such a harsh tone."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven sympathized with her after seeing her shedding tears.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, you should go home first. I'll see you tomorrow."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His tone became more gentle, making Queenie guess that he still had her in his heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking about what happened back then, Queenie felt terrible, and her tears flowed uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She loved that guy, but why did she marry Steven?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was growing up in darkness, and Queenie's presence was his ray of hope.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The nicer Steven was to Queenie, the more she felt disgusted with him at that time, and she deserved better. This grimy man seemed to come from hell, looking so indifferent that she didn't even dare to look at him directly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Queenie realized how wonderful Steven was only after she had been hurt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie nodded knowingly and quietly followed Evan out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The party went smoothly. After Alexander asked the butler and his assistant to take care of the guests, he took Diana to a quiet place for dinner.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander had truly prepared the flavorful steak for Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once the two were seated, Diana offered herself two glasses of water first, and she finally felt much more comfortable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Alexander watched Diana's generous and unpretentious gestures, he smiled gently at her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was supposed to be an introverted man, but in front of Diana's true nature, he always smiled amiably. Not far away, his assistant saw Alexander's gentle expression.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He opened his mouth wide in surprise and didn't close it for a long time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at Alexander and smiled apologetically, "Mr. Powell, I'm sorry that I'm truly hungry right now, so I'll stop acting like I'm eating gracefully."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Diana picked up her fork and began to gobble down the food.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander blinked, unable to hide the loss in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If a woman didn't take care of her image in front of a man, the woman would not see him as a man, and he would just be an unimportant person.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's expression was instantly serious. But as he watched her eat, his lost expression quietly disappeared again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He smiled and reminded her, "Eat slowly. These are all yours."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled. She was eating, so she didn't say anything, but his soft voice was truly nice, making her feel warm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmm..." Diana nodded vaguely.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had already eaten the steak, so she was less flustered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She ate much slower and looked up into Alexander's deep eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana blinked, pointed to the front of him, and said, "Mr. Powell, why are you looking at me? I'm not flavorful food, and I'm not a crispy roast chicken, so hurry up and eat."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was amused by her. His gaze fell gently on Diana, making her feel as comfortable as a breeze in the spring.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled and asked, "Diana, haven't you and Steven gotten divorced yet?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="42.html">« Prev</a><a href="44.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
