I'll head over there now. There will really be something interesting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana chuckled, "Okay, go ahead. Watching a good show is important, but safety is more important. Be careful and drive slowly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna was very serious. "Okay, Diana. I will be careful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana replied, "Well! Bye."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna hung up and drove cautiously. Traffic jams were common on snowy days with heavy fog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there wasn't much traffic today, so it only took forty minutes to reach Amelie's villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff's car pulled into the villa. He opened the car door and dragged her out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before entering the villa, they started arguing in the courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff lost his temper, and Amelie was terrified. She shrank and yelled, "Jeff, what are you doing? It hurts. Let go of me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slapped her across the face. She was plump, not as slender and elegant as Paula.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were bloodshot. He glared at Amelie, actually feeling somewhat disgusted with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was caught off guard. Tears welled up in her eyes. She asked in disbelief, "Jeff, you slapped me because of Paula's synthesized videos? How could you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice trembled, and her face was burning with pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff gazed at her icily and mocked her, "Amelie, I have spoiled you all my life. I am quite familiar with you. I know whether you're having an affair with Mark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I gave up everything just to live up to your waiting, but you betrayed me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He laughed at himself. "Amelie, Amelie, I know you very well. Just tell me, how far have you two progressed? How many years have you been together, 10 or 20 years?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When did you meet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie looked at him aggrievedly and said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula, who was outside the villa at that moment, sent a message to Jeff.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Jeff, Amelie and Mr. Foliot went to high school together and have kept in touch with each other. Congratulations, you are cuckolded.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff's face distorted with anger. Amelie and Mark knew each other in high school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why didn't he find it out?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was very nervous as Jeff stared at his phone screen. His face darkened even more. What did he see?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He approached her and slapped her hard across the face again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie screamed. Before she could react, Jeff grabbed her hair and beat her up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was pissed off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave up his five children and Paula, but what did Amelie do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She actually cuckolded him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You cheat on me, Amelie. How dare you? All the money I've earned over the years has gone to you and our son. How much did the money add up to over 20 years? Everything I've planned over the years was for you, our daughter, and our son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Despite being cursed by everyone, I insisted on marrying you. Why did you betray me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How much did Mark pay you?" Jeff asked while beating Amelie. He flew into a rage. He had been secretly tricking Paula out of money over the years, all of it going to her and their son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He supported her, but she cuckolded him.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="615.html">« Prev</a><a href="617.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
