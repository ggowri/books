Looking at Steven's expectant eyes, he felt helpless. "Ms. Bishop said she has evidence of what happened half a year ago. If you want to cover up for Queenie, she asked you to get prepared for her fighting back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven stared at Evan intently and said, "Did she say that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His hands hanging by his sides tightened involuntarily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He thought she was playing hard to get.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Or she was using this method again to attract his attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Gellar, Ms. Bishop did say that. She said that if you want to hold justice for Ms. Marsh, then wait until she brings out the evidence, and she let you think of a countermeasure first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven took a step back suddenly. He felt a sharp pain in his heart. He took a breath and frowned in pain. His handsome face looked gloomy and unpredictable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven smiled and said, "Call Diana again and tell her that she won this game and ask her to come back home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan wondered how idiotic one should be to say something like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Was Diana playing with Steven?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven was so naive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But people who were hard to get were always the most attractive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven was used to being taken care of by Diana. In the past few months, he couldn't sleep or eat well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Gellar, you seem to have misunderstood Ms. Bishop. She is not playing hard to get with you. She wants to divorce you." Boss just overestimated his charm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven stared at him with a cold gaze and said, "Call her again and ask her to come home. Don't let me go and take her home myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven thought of the scene when he saw her before. She was wearing a white suspender skirt with a beautiful shawl, which made her skin look flawless, her collarbone sexy, and her neck particularly slender and graceful. She leaned on Tobias, and her long legs were faintly visible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It made him particularly distracted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana won, he missed her physically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her reluctant look made his cold heart itchy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan could only call Diana again, and then the call could no longer get through.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan was helpless and said, "Mr. Gellar, I've been blocked too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven narrowed his eyes and pursed his lips slightly, revealing an inexplicable charm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Have you found out who the man next to Diana is?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan frowned and said, "I only found out that his name is Tobias, but I can't find any other information. The girl beside Ms. Bishop was Luna. She seems to be an orphan. She has been with Ms. Bishop since she was a child."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven smiled slightly. The mystery about Diana aroused his strong interest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Gellar, the affairs of Harry and others have been made public."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="123.html">« Prev</a><a href="125.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
