His ears turned slightly red. Being complimented by a girl felt different.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was nothing like Steven. Steven was too brooding. He'd say a few words when in a good mood, but on bad days, he wouldn't say a thing&mdash;let alone smile. Sometimes, she wondered if Steven ever smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Most of the time, it was her making him laugh, while he'd look at her coldly, lacking any romantic interest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">People should smile more to attract better luck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Feeling a bit bashful from Diana's compliment, Alexander looked into her clear eyes and radiant face, smiling back at her. "You look beautiful too, Diana!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana blushed. She had that kind of personality&mdash;unable to handle compliments. When moved, she would cry freely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's head inside quickly. It's getting colder," she urged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander led her in. "Yes, in this cold weather, you were just diving the other day! Did you catch a cold?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shook her head. "No, I didn't get sick after taking medicine when I got home. Just a bit tired."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander nodded, understanding she was worn out. "I remember fishing on the sea last year and caught a huge fish. The drag was terrifying! I have no idea how you manage to catch those tuna and pull them in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana explained with a laugh. "I wouldn't attempt to catch a fish that big. I'm afraid they'd drag me away!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I have my ways to catch them! Growing up by the sea, I know the terrain is complex and that there are many dangers, so I don't mess with the really big fish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I do catch the smaller ones. I love abalone! Once it warms up next year, I'll go harvest some."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander grinned and asked, "Can I join you then? I recently started learning to dive. I want to experience the beauty of the ocean."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana nodded happily. "Sure! I'll introduce you to my older brothers. My three brothers all love diving too, so we can go together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was going to be a super big shot in the future, and all his projects were profitable, so she wanted him to know her brothers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Connections were important, and her brothers were even more so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander smiled back at her bright expression. "Okay! My grandfather often mentions your grandfather's three grandsons, all of whom are exceptional. I'd love to meet them!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was thrilled and planned to introduce Alexander to her brothers when Tobias returned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In this life, her brothers wouldn't end up as tragically as they had before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she still didn't dare to let Queenie know. That woman inexplicably hated her and everyone around her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them ordered their favorite dishes and enjoyed a cheerful meal while chatting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not far away, Steven watched Diana's radiant smile. Ever since Queenie had returned, he hadn't seen her smile like that again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He clenched his fists tightly, fixating on Diana&lsquo;s bright smile. "Diana, I will never let you go!"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="432.html">« Prev</a><a href="434.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
