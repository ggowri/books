She thought, &quot;Did I hear it right? Steven said I plotted to kill Madam Farley.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana pinched the back of her hand hard.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It hurt!</p><p style="text-align:left;">She thought, &quot;I just thought this way. Why did it happen?</p><p style="text-align:left;">It happened too fast. Could it be that I couldn&#x27;t escape Queenie&#x27;s plan after being reborn?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Then, I really have to die once more.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Diana, are you listening to me? Why did you plot to kill Madam Farley?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven&#x27;s voice was cold. His anger was undisguised.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I heard that. Who said I plotted to kill Madam Farley?&quot; asked Diana slowly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Then, Steven roared, &quot;Cecil found out that you pushed Madam Farley when he was investigating why Madam Farley fell into the water. Diana, why are you always scheming others?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana sneered. If she didn&#x27;t explode in silence, she would die in silence. She couldn&#x27;t bear it anymore.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Steven, why are you always accusing me unjustly? Go to hell! Don&#x27;t ever talk to me!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Then, Diana hung up the phone.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven, who was at the Marsh Villa, looked at the phone in disbelief.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Everyone present heard Diana&#x27;s words clearly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Everyone was stunned. Was it still the Diana they knew?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven was in a very irritable mood.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He thought, &quot;What nonsense was she talking about?</p><p style="text-align:left;">She said I accused her unjustly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But Cecil has video evidence.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Looking at the back, it was indeed Diana.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Seeing that the time had come, Queenie said worriedly, &quot;Steven, Dad, Mom, murder is against the law. Why did Diana do that?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Is it because she was stimulated by the divorce with Steven that she did hurtful things and even spoke so rudely?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie&#x27;s eyes were filled with pride. She thought, &quot;It works.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana, you are doomed this time.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jeff sneered, &quot;How could that be? Queenie, I think she is just jealous of you. Once Steven treats you well, she goes crazy. She has always been like this. She always makes trouble when Steven is with you.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;She is no longer my daughter. It cannot involve the Marsh family. Queenie, go to Mr. Farley tomorrow to explain this matter clearly.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie nodded sadly. &quot;Okay, Dad. Diana is really too ignorant. She did that and targeted both the Farley family and the Marsh family.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She deliberately emphasized the word &quot;the Farley family&quot;.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Sure enough, Steven looked increasingly gloomy.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula glanced at Jeff and thought of what Diana had said. Paula had been observing Jeff for three months.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She had done two paternity tests in three months, and it turned out that Queenie was not Jeff&#x27;s daughter.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula thought Diana had deceived her, and she was highly disappointed with Diana.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She took a deep breath and said, &quot;I&#x27;ll talk to Diana tomorrow and ask her to turn herself in.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jeff looked at her, a hint of vigilance flashing in his eyes. &quot;Paula, you are not in good health. I will let Queenie go. They are of similar age and know each other. Let Queenie go and persuade Diana.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula thought about it and didn&#x27;t want to see Diana either. She thought, &quot;Diana wants to sow discord between us.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Well, I don&#x27;t want to see her either. I originally planned to give her some money after the divorce so that she could live a good life. But she even dares to do such a thing as harming others.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula thought, &quot;Diana is my biological daughter. Of course, I feel sorry for her if she has a hard time.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her anger, which had been suppressed for three months, burst out in silence.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Forget it. I&#x27;ll go meet Diana tomorrow.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula was reluctant to accept it and wondered what Diana wanted to do.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She thought, &quot;Diana is just jealous of Queenie.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven frowned slightly. He and Diana had not divorced yet.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He glanced at the three coldly. Even he felt their coldness. He left the Marsh Villa in silence.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven wanted to investigate further. </p><div class="pagination"><a href="12.html">« Prev</a><a href="14.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
