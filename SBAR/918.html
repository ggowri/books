Diana who had always been looked down upon by her was so accomplished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The array of diplomas flashed before her eyes, overwhelming her senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had often called Diana worthless, and now, faced with these impressive credentials, her cheeks burned with humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana observed Queenie's disbelief, and her expression was a twisted mask of rage and despair. With a teasing smile, Diana said, "Queenie, you pride yourself on your noble background and prestigious education. Surely, you can read a diploma, right? Or is it so hard for you to accept that others can be exceptional?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the cutthroat game of power, Queenie had always viewed everyone as mere pawns, oblivious to the fact that she was just another piece on the board.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's cool voice snapped Queenie back to reality. Meeting Diana's piercing gaze made her take a step back as if the very air around them had shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want to acknowledge Diana's brilliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the woman she had always kept in the mud, a pawn in her power play.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, that pawn had become the queen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the triumphant glint in Diana's eyes, Queenie asked, "Diana, if you have such impressive qualifications, why didn't you tell us? Why hide this? What are you really up to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for Steven suddenly giving him all the assets, she wouldn't have been exposed so early.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana chuckled steady with tone. "I'm not up to anything. There's no need to hide. There are plenty of geniuses out there, and I just happen to be one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not something to flaunt. You all just have such shallow perceptions, and now are you blaming me for keeping it under wraps?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streamed down her face as the realization hit her. The very person she had scorned was far more accomplished than she could have ever imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sting of her past insults echoed in her mind, each one a reminder of her own insecurities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Diana returned, Queenie had been trapped in her own bitterness, shackled by the label of "illegitimate child," a burden that would forever haunt her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had desperately tried to escape that identity, but it had ultimately been exposed. She was the daughter born from Jeff's infidelity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Luna, let's move on to the new project. Please escort these two irrelevant people out of here," Diana instructed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna turned to the bodyguards nearby and commanded, "Throw them out of the building. They're not allowed to set foot in here again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you've got some nerve! Who do you think you're throwing out?" Andrew's furious voice boomed from the doorway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his father's arrival, George's face lit up with hope. He mused, "Finally, Dad is here. He has shares in the company and has always opposed Diana with other shareholders. There's no way she can become the new president today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana regarded Andrew with a mocking smile. "Throw him out, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew, George, and Queenie were left in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew stormed forward, and his anger was palpable. "Diana, this company belongs to the Gellar family. You can't just do as you please. I'm a shareholder here, too..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those measly shares you have? What authority do you really think you hold?" Diana shot back, and her confidence was unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew met her gaze, and fury ignited in his eyes. "Diana, I underestimated you. You're actually plotting against the Gellar family's assets."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your family's assets? Can't you and Steven handle the heat? If you can't take the loss, then why sign the agreement? All contracts are legally binding. If you don't understand that, my lawyer can enlighten you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave now. I still need to discuss the company's future with the shareholders."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that she had overcome her feelings for Steven, Diana felt fearless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nothing could hold her back from pursuing what she wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew crossed his arms defiantly. "I'm a shareholder, too, and I intend to stay and listen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shot him a cold smile. "Mr. Andrew Gellar, you can stay, but if you cause any trouble, I won't hesitate to have you removed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fury coursed through Andrew as he clenched his fists. The situation had already spiraled beyond his control, and he knew he had to play the long game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward had always been eyeing Andrew as if he were a thief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His sense of familial responsibility had compelled him to pressure Steven into signing that agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph! I can't wait to see how you, a nobody, plan to run this company. With your shallow understanding, do you think you can manage anything?" Andrew couldn't help but publicly mock Diana, and his tone dripped with sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's smile was icy, her voice calm and composed. "You don't need to worry about how I run my business. Maybe focus on your own health instead of poking your nose into others' affairs. My capabilities don't need your validation. The monthly dividends will speak for themselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Andrew could retort, Diana cut him off. "Ladies and gentlemen, I have two projects to discuss. First, while Mr. Gellar was still with the company, he appointed me as the head designer for the spring fashion show. Here's the development plan for that. The second project is an artificial intelligence therapy system. Both of these projects have the potential to bring in significant profits over the next three years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be collaborating with the Powell Group on this, with Tom leading the team. You'll all receive complete development plans for both projects on your phones, and you'll get a chance to experience my new software."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't shy away from revealing her plans, even with Queenie and the others present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leones opened the software on his phone, astonished by what he saw. "Ms. Bishop, what is this? What kind of office software is this? Why does it have pop-up screens?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled. "This is an office software developed by my previous company. It features automatic pop-ups that allow you to view different templates and make clear comparisons."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leones was thrilled. "Ms. Bishop, if this software is further refined, it could sell like hotcakes in major companies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "This software is for internal use only."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leones looked puzzled. "Ms. Bishop, a program like this&mdash;one that even the best tech firms abroad can't replicate&mdash;your company developed it. That would make it the best in the world!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana chuckled softly. "Leones, it's just a simple little program we whipped up in a few days. The real breakthrough is in the development of the AI medical system, which aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy, improve treatment effectiveness, and optimize resource allocation to provide more humane care for patients. This is urgent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had seen too many lives lost due to lack of funds for treatment. If she could make a breakthrough in the field of AI, she intended to establish a charitable foundation to bring hope to those in need of medical care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this new life, Diana was determined to pursue what she truly wanted and to do meaningful work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One shareholder, excited after reviewing the proposal, exclaimed, "Ms. Bishop, I'm on board! The development of the AI medical system has immense potential and a bright future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he hesitated, and concern crept into his voice. "Ms. Bishop, do you have the talent for this kind of project?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="917.html">« Prev</a><a href="919.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
