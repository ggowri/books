But that was beyond her control; it wasn't her place to interfere. Her sole focus now was to clear her name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this time, Queenie was confined to her bed after her recent abortion, leaving Diana with no respite. Just when Diana thought she could steal a moment of peace to rest and breathe, she was suddenly confronted by Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Diana stepped inside, she recognized the police officer who had taken her statement before. Mark was there, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reporters from various media outlets crowded the doorway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Mark spotted Diana, his eyes blazed with fury, and he lunged forward as if he wanted to strangle her on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you monster! You killed my wife. I want you to pay with your life! How could you be so heartless? My children are still so young! Why did you take their mother from them? Just for such a trivial matter, you took her life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, are you even human?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana listened to his hoarse, enraged voice and smiled serenely. "Mr. Foliot, why are you so worked up? Are you certain I killed your wife? Or did you tie her up in the basement and freeze her to death yourself? Then, you cover your tracks and destroy the body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think finding my clothes at the scene proves I killed her? That's laughable. I just found out my clothes are missing, and guess what? The thief's been caught. Are you still so sure you want to frame me with this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana saw Mark as nothing but a fool with countless flaws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She watched him and smiled. With her delicate features, she stood out in the crowd; her posture was perfect, and her demeanor radiated an exceptional aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark's face contorted with shock and rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Witnessing her radiant smile and the confidence she exuded, he felt a chill inexplicably running down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How on earth did Diana know about him binding his wife in the basement and leaving her to freeze to death?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana tilted her head slightly, her eyes piercing into his, yet she said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a female reporter thrust her camera in Diana's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you killed Mrs. Foliot. Don't you feel any guilt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stared back at the reporter as her gaze turned icy. "You claim I killed his wife. Do you have any evidence? You thrust that camera in my face, throw accusations at me, and have the nerve to ask if I feel guilty. Tell me, when you're framing me, do you feel any guilt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reporter, having tasted Diana's sharp tongue before, suddenly felt a pang of guilt. "It's all over the internet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You also know it's all over the internet. How much of what's on the internet is true? You journalists know better than us ordinary folks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes, Diana interjected. She harbored a deep loathing for those who bent the truth to their will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this was indeed the way of the world. Wherever there were people, there existed a battleground, a perpetual struggle for dominance and survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you're so arrogant. The evidence is irrefutable. You're the murderer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A male reporter, finding himself unnerved by Diana's unwavering smile, raised his voice and shouted at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shot back a glare and yelled, "Why are you shouting so loudly? Maybe eat less salt; seems like your mouth's dry from having nothing better to do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The male reporter was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're nothing but a troublemaker. No wonder you're so ruthless, having taken so many lives," he retorted with accusation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana responded as her smile was both elegant and captivating, "I'm arrogant because my conscience is clear. I've encountered fools, but never one as monumental as you. I must say, I'm quite envious of your brain. When you were born, your brain must have snipped it off with the umbilical cord, didn't they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The male reporter blinked, utterly speechless. Even if he were given another life, he couldn't match her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pointed at Diana, fuming. "You! You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean by that? Can't even speak plainly. Get out of here. If you've got evidence, slap it in my face. If not, stop trolling. Otherwise, you'll be disgracing your ancestors."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The male reporter quivered with indignation, inwardly cursing, "A total shrew!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="817.html">« Prev</a><a href="819.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
