"I didn't take any money! I'm just stating the facts!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana scoffed. "I was just asking. No need to get so worked up. Clearly, it's your first time doing this. Your eyes are more scrambled than a QR code."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The male reporter replied, "But it takes two to tango."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana, irritated, slapped him across the face. "One hand can't clap, huh? Did that sound quiet to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What a fierce woman!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You... You dared to hit me?" The male reporter was shocked, staring wide-eyed at Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana arrogantly replied, "You've insulted me to my face, and you expect me to just let it go? You back off. I won't."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If others argue when they're wrong, why should she show mercy when she's right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Another female reporter stepped up, pressing her. "Ms. Bishop, it's best to forgive when possible. This mother is disabled; you should be more understanding."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana laughed at the shamelessness, glaring at the woman. "What does 'being considerate' even mean? Should I make myself miserable just to make you all happy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana turned to Luna. "Luna, take pictures of all these reporters' faces. Look into each of them and find out who sent them. I want them to remember that 'suffering is a blessing,' so that they'll have endless 'blessings' in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna took out her phone and began photographing all the reporters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Another middle-aged male reporter got angry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Ms. Bishop, I heard you were at fault in the first place and got punished, leading to your kidnapping. Can't you show some compassion for this disabled mother's hardship?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana immediately snapped back, "Why should I consider others? When I was bullied, when I was kidnapped, did anyone consider me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Since you like thinking for others so much, why don't you take care of this disabled mother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The male reporter choked, unable to respond. He could barely take care of himself. How could he take care of someone else?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana looked at the seven reporters. These were the ones Queenie had paid off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In her past life, she had been surrounded and insulted by reporters just like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The reason was simple. Harry had claimed she was his woman and had cheated on him, which led him to run her over. This time around, she hadn't hesitated to send Harry to jail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She looked coldly at the reporters. "I don't care what reason you have for interviewing me, but none of you are leaving today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A few reporters laughed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">One female reporter scoffed, "Ms. Bishop, what are you saying? Are you going to imprison us here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana picked up her phone and called the police.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After she finished calling, Diana looked at the female reporter and said, "Do you really think you're worth imprisoning? I'm just inviting you to stay and wait for the police, so they can have a nice chat with you all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The reporters were all stunned.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="140.html">« Prev</a><a href="142.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
