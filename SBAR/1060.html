She knew Steven was serious at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course! I mean it," she said, her tone encouraging. "You need to pull yourself together now and beat them all. We'll figure out the rest later."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, she even gave him a little thumbs-up gesture.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven couldn't help but smile. To him, she looked both beautiful and adorable in that moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He nodded gently, his gaze filled with affection. "Diana, I will."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a moment of silence, he asked, almost sulking, "Diana, do we really have to sleep in separate rooms?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shot him a sharp glare. "Steven, you're pushing your luck! Legally, we're married, but we don't have a real marriage, and we've kept our distance in private. You better not cross any lines."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven rubbed his face, his tone filled with helplessness. "Diana, ever since the car accident, I've had trouble sleeping. But last night, lying next to you, I slept so well. I can only make better decisions when I'm well-rested."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt speechless</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Does he see me as a sleeping pill?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And a free one at that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How dare he make such a request?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When I truly loved him, he didn&rsquo;t want me. And now he&rsquo;s starting to act all affectionate? I just feel so uncomfortable."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her smile was bright, almost deliberate. She had no intention of being his sleep aid, let alone comforting him to sleep.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A year ago, it was Steven who couldn&rsquo;t sleep because of her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It&rsquo;s fine. Even if you&rsquo;ve been an insomniac for ten years with depression, I can fix that. I have a special incense. Light it before bed, and I guarantee you&rsquo;ll fall asleep in ten minutes, dreamless. Plus, you&rsquo;ll wake up feeling refreshed the next day."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Noticing the dark circles under his eyes, Diana figured he really hadn&rsquo;t been sleeping well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No wonder he&rsquo;d made such an irrational decision earlier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But since his mind wasn&rsquo;t clear, she could forgive him this time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven lowered his head, feeling dejected. To him, no sleep aid could compare to the comfort of holding her as he drifted off.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright," he forced a smile. After all, he still had a year, so he wasn&rsquo;t giving up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glanced at the time and said, "</span><span>H</span><span>ead upstairs. The meeting starts in ten minutes."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven replied gently, "Alright."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two took the electric wheelchair upstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching the scene, Diana couldn&rsquo;t help but find it amusing. "Well, I never thought I&rsquo;d end up using a wheelchair one day."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Steven&rsquo;s second time in a wheelchair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glanced at his leg.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During the accident, he turned to shield Diana, which left his left leg the most injured. But now, he was much better.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though there was still a sharp pain when he walked, he&rsquo;d fully recover in three months.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I dragged you into this."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled. "I already told you, no need to apologize. Even if that night hadn&rsquo;t happened, they would&rsquo;ve come for me sooner or later. But you really should focus more when driving. </span><span>S</span><span>tuck in a wheelchair isn&rsquo;t exactly fun."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven noticed she was always smiling. She was undeniably optimistic, even when bullied by the Marsh family, she still faced it all with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he knew deep down she was hurting.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright," he replied guiltily, silently vowing to make it up to her in the future.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At Paula's house, Gale, Eric, and she sat in the living room, the atmosphere heavy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan's actions had completely caught them off guard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric said darkly, "</span><span>Paula</span><span>, Dylan framed Diana. It&rsquo;s definitely Queenie behind it. He&rsquo;s too stupid to think with his muddled brain!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula had been in low spirits ever since she saw the news that morning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Paula silent, Gale softly comforted her, "</span><span>D</span><span>on&rsquo;t be too upset. Dylan won&rsquo;t grow up unless he learns the hard way. Once he struggles out there, he&rsquo;ll figure things out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Long lectures were useless on Dylan, just like when they tried to reason with him before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula had clearly said it wasn&rsquo;t Diana&rsquo;s fault, and Diana even explained how Queenie was out to get him, but he refused to believe it no matter what.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Who would&rsquo;ve thought the little sister they spoiled since childhood could be this terrifying?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula let out a long sigh, lower</span><span>ing her head, her eyes filled with sorrow. "</span><span> </span><span>Dylan&rsquo;s just like your father&mdash;selfish. He won&rsquo;t care that Queenie hurt me. The worst part? I&rsquo;ve lost a son. You&rsquo;ve lost a brother.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I carried him for nine months and gave birth to him. Even though I tell myself not to care, seeing him act like this still breaks my heart."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula couldn&rsquo;t deny it. Every time she thought about it, it felt like her heart was being torn apart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn&rsquo;t </span><span>accept</span><span> that her son could be that kind of person.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>March was Diana's birthday, and Paula had planned to make it up to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since Diana came back, Paula had thrown Queenie a birthday party worth millions of dollars, but she had never cared about Diana&rsquo;s birthday.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But sadly, Diana didn&rsquo;t need it anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The only thing Paula could do now was to bring Queenie to justice.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of Diana&rsquo;s bright smile and the careful way she used to call her "Mom," Paula now felt nothing but heartache.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was all her own doing, but she couldn&rsquo;t accept being deceived. In the end, she even lost her own daughter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula looked at Gale and said, "Gale, Diana&rsquo;s birthday is in just over a month. Every year, we&rsquo;ve focused all our attention on Queenie. This year, I want to throw a birthday party for Diana."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale gave a bitter smile. "Paula , even if we want to do this, Diana doesn&rsquo;t need it anymore."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well..." Paula let out a self-deprecating laugh. "You&rsquo;re right. She hasn&rsquo;t needed us for a long time. She&rsquo;s so remarkable, yet we never really understood her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula felt a wave of sadness, her voice catching as she tried to hold back a sob.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She clutched the fabric over her chest tightly, fighting back the pain, then turned to Eric and said, "Eric, anything about Dylan overseas?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric nodded and replied, "</span><span>Yeah</span><span>, he got drunk abroad, hit someone</span><span> in an accident</span><span>, and lost all his money. As soon as the flights resumed, he came back. Now he&rsquo;s clinging to Diana, probably trying to take Steven&rsquo;s company back. </span><span>Such</span><span> </span><span>an idiot."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula said coldly, "Whatever he&rsquo;s planning, he&rsquo;s definitely going to make things hard for Diana. You two better get him in jail. He can&rsquo;t keep being Queenie&rsquo;s pawn."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She fixed her gaze on Eric, her tone firm. "Eric, call him now and take him to your company. He won&rsquo;t steal anything today, but he&rsquo;ll definitely try at some point. When he does, you&rsquo;d better send him straight to jail."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1059.html">« Prev</a><a href="1061.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
