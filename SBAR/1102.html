She regretted coming to see him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was on the verge of tears. "George, did you say that on purpose?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He deliberately told her that the person he liked was none other than Diana, the one Queenie constantly complained about for being dumb and clueless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie found it so ironic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unwilling to accept it, she cried, "George, in my eyes, Diana is just a useless fool. You even mocked her with me. And now you're telling me she's the one you like? That's ridiculous."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George's eyes were bloodshot. He hadn't slept since his arrest. He had never been loved. Not truly. Not even by Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew he was completely done for, but he had to say what needed to be said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're right. I did mock her with you. But every time you talked about her, I couldn't help but envy Steven. Because no matter how much you all hurt Diana, she still loved Steven without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She's not like you. While I was abroad, you were messing around with other men.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You even got pregnant. You were unfaithful. You were never honest with me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those words hurt Queenie even more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie's emotions were a tangled mess.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had always believed that George truly loved her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"George, you're lying," Queenie screamed, tears streaming down her face. She couldn't accept having nothing left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, even the man who once loved her didn</span><span>'</span><span>t love her anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her face twisted in agony as she thought, "How could George do this to me? We had over a decade together. He</span><span>'</span><span>s turned me into a joke."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George smirked coldly, "You're absolutely right. I did love you. When I came back, I was with Yvette, but I was still moved by everything you did for me, so I married you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But I never pretended I wanted to take everything from the Gellar family and then casually take Diana too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When I came back, I kept hoping Diana would come to me. But she never did. I thought I could enjoy the same treatment Steven got, but Diana</span><span>'</span><span>s smart. The moment she saw me, she knew I wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t Steven."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George let out a bitter laugh. Diana loved Steven so deeply that she could recognize in an instant that George wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie broke down. She had no idea he had thoughts like this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had nothing to say.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Turns out, what he longed for was Diana's undying love.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie stood up, smiling coldly at him. "George, you can stay here and atone for your sins. No matter how much you like Diana, you don</span><span>'</span><span>t stand a chance anymore."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George chuckled, a hint of relief in his voice. "Queenie, you're wrong. I'm not atoning. Death isn't scary&mdash;it means freedom."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You've always been adored. You have no idea how much I suffered living in the dark. Death doesn</span><span>'</span><span>t scare me. What terrifies me is being alive and having no one who truly loves me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As George finished speaking, he noticed Queenie's body tremble slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George continued, "Queenie, death isn</span><span>'</span><span>t the scary part. What</span><span>'</span><span>s terrifying is being alive and losing everyone you care about, piece by piece, and everything you once wanted most."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie fled the meeting room as if she were running away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George watched her retreating figure with a wicked grin.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew her too well. It was effortless for him to keep her up all night, restless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George burst into laughter, his voice echoing through the entire meeting room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His laughter was hollow&mdash;filled with sorrow, helplessness, and pain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some people want to live, but all he ever thought about was dying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie broke out of prison and stood by the roadside, gasping for air. Her eyes filled with tears as George's words echoed in her mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had said, "Queenie, death isn</span><span>'</span><span>t the scary part. What</span><span>'</span><span>s terrifying is being alive and losing everyone you care about, piece by piece, and everything you once wanted most."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie broke down and screamed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George knew exactly what she feared most. She was terrified of losing everything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had been trying so hard, yet losing more and more. George knew exactly what she cared about the most, and he brought her here, saying those words on purpose.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words were like a sharp blade, stabbing straight into Queenie's heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie stood by the roadside, struggling to breathe through the pain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She stood there for a long time before finally heading back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She got home. Mario saw her red, swollen eyes and felt a pang of heartache. He walked over, took her hand, and asked, "Queenie, what's wrong? Who hurt you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie looked at Mario's gentle expression and thought about how she still had him, and Sandra and the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She reminded herself that she wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t completely alone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie shook her head with a smile and said, "I'm fine. Are Steven and Diana at the office?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t let George</span><span>'</span><span>s words break her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario said, "Looks like they left. They</span><span>'</span><span>re not at the office. I heard Steven and Diana made up and went on a trip."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Vacation?" Queenie said with a helpless laugh. "Diana is such a fool! Steven hurt her so badly, and she still forgave him?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario looked at her intently and said, "Queenie, it</span><span>'</span><span>s not surprising at all. Love is uncontrollable, just like my love for you. No matter how many men have been in your life, I still love you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words reminded Queenie of what George had said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario could accept her past. A woman</span><span>'</span><span>s life doesn</span><span>'</span><span>t have to revolve around just one man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie thought, "George couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t do it himself, so why should I?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie leaned into Mario</span><span>'</span><span>s arms and whispered, "Mario, I gave my heart and ended up betrayed. I hope you won</span><span>'</span><span>t do the same to me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had truly loved George.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back then, her heart ached for George, always hiding in the shadows.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment Queenie saw him, she was stunned. She knew he wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven never smiled. George did.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had the same face, but George</span><span>'</span><span>s smile was bright and charming.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was always distant, always brooding.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie didn</span><span>'</span><span>t like Steven</span><span>'</span><span>s gloom, but she loved the intellectual thrill he brought her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He</span><span>'</span><span>d give her money to spend and help her bully Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter what he once thought, the harm he caused Diana was real.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie increasingly felt that Steven was the most cunning bastard. He played along with her, putting on an act, all to protect Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She truly hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t noticed that Steven was just acting.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Charlie also let her go because of Diana's departure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie, unwilling to give up, looked at Mario and said, "Find out where they are."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1101.html">« Prev</a><a href="1103.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
