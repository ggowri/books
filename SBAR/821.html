You see me alone, and you think I'm an easy target," Diana said calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark froze again, surprised that she would openly admit this in front of the media.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others would try to hide such things, but here was Diana, boldly acknowledging it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear she held no attachment whatsoever to the Marsh or Barnes families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, in a car, Paula and Eric watched the livestream, tears streaming down their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eric, your sister will never forgive us in this lifetime."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric nodded with a bitter smile. "Mom, we've hurt her so deeply. Diana won't forgive us, and she's right not to. What we did to her was unforgivable. Even to a stranger, we wouldn't have done something so cruel. Yet, we did it to the person closest to us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thinking from her perspective, if someone treated me the way we treated her, I'd probably want to kill them, let alone forgive them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric's voice was heavy with pain. He understood that Diana would never forgive them now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that was why she could speak so freely, so confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula's face was pale, and her eyes were filled with regret. If only she had believed Diana back then, if only she hadn't gone to confront her with those horrible accusations, Diana might have forgiven her. She knew her daughter's heart was kind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her lip, fighting back her sobs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had grown up alone, without any parental love. When she finally returned to Paula, Paula hadn't fulfilled her duties as a mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, as Diana faced her troubles, she had no one by her side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Paula thought about it, the more heartbroken she felt. She knew this was all a scheme by Amelie to frame Diana, but she had no evidence to help her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Diana, if she saw her now, would likely reject her even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula closed her eyes in anguish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Queenie had already realized that the company she inherited was an empty shell and had called to berate Paula over it just a few nights before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula had responded with equal harshness, and Queenie had spat back that Paula ending up alone was what she deserved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So now, they had turned their efforts toward ruining Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula was furious, but there was little she could do but wait for the right moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the police station, Mark argued with the officer. "Officer, Diana is the murderer! Why haven't you arrested her yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a cold, aged voice echoed through the hall. "Diana is not the murderer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark's entire body trembled. That was a voice he'd heard for over twenty years; one he knew all too well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spun around to see Luna pushing Lily into the room in a wheelchair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, you... you're alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark was speechless, his face a mix of shock and dread. If she was alive, then he was done for. His face contorted into a bizarre array of expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily met his eyes coldly, watching his shock and fear. Her gaze grew even colder. "If he is this frightened, how will he handle what is yet to come?" she wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, that night I was attacked and tied up in a basement. I managed to escape, and Diana saved me and took me to the hospital. I've been unconscious since then, which is why you all thought I was dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark was momentarily stunned. He hadn't expected her to say that. She'd just claimed she'd been attacked by criminals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't revealed the truth that he was the one who had tied her up and abandoned her in the basement to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she had said nothing about that night. Just as he'd suspected, her love for him ran too deep, and she'd never betray him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark approached her, feigning concern. "Lily, thank goodness you're alive. You have no idea how worried we've all been."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily stared at him, his deceitful expression making her lips curl into a faint smile.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="820.html">« Prev</a><a href="822.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
