He walked over to the car, opened the door and let Steven in. He quickly got in the cab and drove after Tobias' car.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Gale returned home, Queenie stood at the door to greet him in person. Seeing his handsome face flushed and swollen, Queenie thought, "Did he get hit?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie asked in surprise, "Gale, what happened to your face?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale smiled dotingly when he saw Queenie, "It's okay, I went to find Diana, and we had a little argument. Queenie, don't worry, I'll make sure Diana comes back and apologizes to you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie lowered her head sorrowfully. "Gale, she doesn't have to apologize to me, and I just wish she wouldn't pester Steven and embarrass him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry, Queenie. Steven is yours, and I will make Steven marry you. Only Steven is worthy of Queenie, who is gentle and kind."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana only deserved to be a country girl and would best never be seen in front of them again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie smiled with joy, holding Gale's arm cheerfully, "Gale, thank you for being so nice to me all the time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula, who had just entered, heard Gale's words, and she sneered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The cheapest thing was the hypocritical sincerity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But none of them could see it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because they watched Queenie grow up since they were young, and what she showed in front of them was always her gentle and kind attitude.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sure enough, people had to go through endless dedication before they got a distressing result.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom, you're back." Queenie, who was about to close the door, was surprised to see Paula back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "Why didn't Mom inform us of her return this time?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Right! My work is going well. I've resolved it, so I'm just coming back first." Paula came in dragging her suitcase, her eyes calm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom, you're back just in time. Diana bullied Queenie again, and she couldn't live a day without getting into trouble."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The most annoying thing was that Diana recognized someone else as her brother.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula looked over at Queenie, who was aggrieved. "Oh! How did Diana set you up this time?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie felt that Paula had changed, her eyes had become less like what they used to be for her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom, what's wrong with you?" Queenie knew that Paula was suspecting this whole thing about her and Jeff being biological father and daughter.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="91.html">« Prev</a><a href="93.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
