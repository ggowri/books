Get away from me, or I'll bash you with a coconut shell."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana warned him and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In this lifetime, if she was lucky enough, she wanted to find a man who loved her very much and had a serious relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was amused by her adorable appearance; such a lively Diana made him feel joyful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven touched his chin, as it was also his first kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven felt happy. That kiss was beautiful. Her lips were very soft.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He really wanted to eat the meals made by Diana. After eating her cooking for two years, it had truly spoiled his palate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He watched as Diana walked over to the trash bin, picked up a stone, and smashed all the shellfish to extract only the meat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "Is she still going to fish today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, Diana..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana stood up with the basin in her hands and saw Cecil. She was taken aback, looking at Cecil who came rushing over, quite surprised. "Why are you here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil stood in the morning light, dressed in a white shirt and pants, which made him look like a handsome high school boy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil raised his phone and smiled, "I saw that you were going fishing today, so I came. Diana, take me with you this time, please. I can't free dive, but I just want to see how you catch fish."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked at the calm sea, the morning breeze already carrying a chill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana said, "We need to go out to sea during the day to dive. How about we go at night instead? There are more fish at night."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Go at night? What if I accidentally fall into the sea, would you be able to see me?" He was a bit afraid of the sea at night and preferred to go out during the day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the wind picked up, he was actually quite scared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana rolled her eyes at him and said, "Can't you think of something positive? There are still three days until the high tide this month, and today is indeed a good day to go out to sea, but it will take two hours by boat. There's a small island nearby with plenty of seafood. If you're going, call Paige and bring a tent. We might not come back tonight. I plan to dive in the evening and head straight back to the city after returning tomorrow morning."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wow! That sounds so exciting. I'll take care of the tent and the boat. Diana, you just need to handle our dinner."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled, looking at the seafood in the basin. She said, "Come on, follow me upstairs. I'll treat you to a seafood breakfast."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh!" Cecil's eyes lit up. "That's great, Diana, I didn't expect to be able to eat it as soon as I arrived."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana said, "I caught these yesterday when I went out to sea. What you did last night was invaluable, so, of course, I have to reward you properly. Tonight, I'll catch some lobsters for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil smiled, the sunshine was bright, and his smile was especially radiant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was also infected by his smile and couldn't help but smile as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana!" Paige also came over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The three of them came up together, while Steven stood at a distance, looking gloomily at Cecil and thinking, "Why is he here too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Gellar, are you going out?" Evan walked over and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven saw him and said, "Diana is going fishing today. Follow Cecil later and rent a boat to where she is going."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan was very shocked; he had also seen Diana's posts on Instagram, which were quite challenging. He said, "Mr. Gellar, are we really going there?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven narrowed his eyes, thinking about what Diana had said about them not coming back tonight. He smiled with a meaningful look. "Let's go and have some fun. Find a bigger boat; we won't be coming back tonight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was about to leave when Evan quickly said, "Mr. Gellar, wait a moment. I found some information; I think you might want to take a look."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="400.html">« Prev</a><a href="402.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
