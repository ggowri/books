She insisted on doing everything herself, displaying her small-mindedness. How had he not seen all these flaws before?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff deeply regretted it. He thought that with Paula's capabilities, she could still make a comeback.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But given her temperament, she would never take him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Jeff thought about it, the angrier he became. Compared to the life he had before, he now saw himself as nothing but a greasy old man with nothing to show for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly stood up, glaring at Amelie with eyes full of rage. "Amelie, how could you? How could you have that kind of relationship with Mark? Even if you two had that kind of relationship, you should've kept it hidden. We wouldn't have been so humiliated tonight, getting kicked out in front of all those prominent figures. You ruined my reputation. We're legally married, and this disgraceful affair is suffocating me.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With Lily's vengeful nature, she'll definitely retaliate against my company. And with her family being on par with the Foliot family, they won't spare Mark either."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was worried about this, too. If Jeff's company collapsed, he would become nothing but a burden.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie, in her rage, had momentarily forgotten this reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly spoke, "Queenie, go home tonight. There's no need for you to stay here. I'll handle what happened tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie shot Jeff a cold, mocking glance. "Jeff, you're nothing but a waste of space. Since everything's out in the open, we'll just have to deal with it. Mark my words, my life would be better without a useless man like you. If you think I'm dirty, then go ahead and divorce me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was dumbfounded by her harsh words.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He watched in stunned silence as Amelie walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He roared after her, "Amelie, where are you going? Haven't you embarrassed us enough?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie gave him a cold, disdainful look. "Jeff, what's a little embarrassment? My whole life has been one long humiliation..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've given you tens of millions of dollars over the years. Wasn't that enough for you? Have you ever paid even a single cent for the maintenance fees of this villa? You only spend money on shopping, dining, and makeup. How could those millions not be enough to keep your heart?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff felt utterly defeated. To give her a good life, he had secretly given her tens of millions of dollars over the years, yet she still had an affair with Mark.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't comprehend it!</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hah! How could your meager amount be enough for me? I'll handle my own affairs. And let's be clear. You're not exactly clean, either. You and that female assistant of yours were all cozy together. Whenever you went on business trips, you always booked just one hotel room.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jeff, I didn't drag your dirty laundry out into the open, so you'd better hold your tongue."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words were a heavy blow, and he staggered back.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did she know about my assistant? Even Paula hadn't noticed it," he thought, bewildered.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie looked around at the chaotic mess of a family and felt like something deeply valuable had slipped through her fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what happened that night, Steven was even unwilling to help her.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="654.html">« Prev</a><a href="656.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
