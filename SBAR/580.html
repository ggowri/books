You are a kind person. And your child will have upright values."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle said, "Of course. My little girl got great grades. She is really excellent. My oldest daughter is excellent, too. They are very understanding. I work hard to save money for my daughter to go to college. When she becomes a judge, she will find the murderer who hurt her sister."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle's eyes were filled with tears. His eldest daughter was very outstanding. Even several years had passed, he still couldn't believe that his daughter would commit suicide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale didn't say anything. After becoming disabled, he understood more and more how difficult life was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His father wanted to destroy and kill them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale took a deep breath and tried to stand up, which was difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about the fact that Diana knew medical skills and had cured Tom's cousin, he clenched his fists. He didn't think he deserved Diana to operate on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't want to pay attention to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She completely gave up on her brothers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale had hurt Diana badly, and now he couldn't save himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Paula hadn't helped him, he would have starved to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula said she would cut off ties with them, but would give him fifty thousand dollars every month for living expenses, so he hired Kyle to be his caregiver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Gale wanted to stand up again, first he had to get his legs up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep breath. He could only ask Diana to perform surgery on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to stand up again. At the age of 30, he wanted to start his life again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale was just about to ask Kyle to go back when he heard Kyle's voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Kyle." He looked back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the wind and snow, the middle-aged man's face was filled with tears. And his whole body was trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale said, "Kyle, what's wrong with you?" Kyle took good care of Gale. Seeing that he was in a bad state, Gale was anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle's hand was shaking as he held the phone. He looked at Gale and was very excited. "Gale, someone brought me great news on this snowy day. It's great. My daughter's injustice has been redressed. The person who bullied her is now in the police station. Look. It was this woman who killed my daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These girls have cornered my daughter, threatened her, beat her, poured ice water on her, hit her with a broom, and slapped her. The teacher even protected them. When I go back this time, I will take these evidences and sue the school. I want revenge for my daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want her to rest in peace."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle became more and more excited as he spoke, and he couldn't help but burst into tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale's hand holding the phone was shaking, because the person in the video who led three women to bully Kyle's daughter was Penelope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana once said that Penelope was not a good girl, but Althea was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale hated Diana so much that he didn't believe what she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had said, "Diana, you are just jealous of Queenie. You and Althea are good friends Althea is upset, so you slandered Penelope to stand up for Althea."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale had only regrets when he learned the truth.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="579.html">« Prev</a><a href="581.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
