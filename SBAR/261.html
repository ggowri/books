Got the triple threat, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high blood sugar, and he won't watch what he eats. Still chowing down on greasy food like there's no tomorrow. Now, he's landed himself in the hospital for a week. Aren't you off from shooting for a bit? You should take care of him for the next few days. Frank's all wrapped up with his girlfriend; he won't be making time for your dad."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie pondered and realized she didn't have much time to care for her father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, why don't we hire a caregiver for Dad?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure, do what you need to. I've got some trouble with a company project, so I can't look after your father." Paula rose and headed upstairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These days, she was rebuilding the company and couldn't afford Queenie's suspicions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That's why she sent Jeff to the hospital without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was determined to make sure that every ounce of effort Jeff had poured into his life's work would amount to nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie frowned. She knew there were problems at the company, but with Paula's abilities, they could be solved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula had spent her life in the business world; this little thing shouldn't faze her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie felt a deep sense of gratitude for Paula's diligent efforts at work, which were instrumental in sculpting her future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula was sharp in business and had taught Queen much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, you must be tired. Go upstairs and rest," Queenie said with concern as she held Paula's arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula nodded. "Yes, you're the most thoughtful."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She then stood and addressed Frank, "You should move out tonight. There's an old, rundown house on Maplewood Drive. That's what I'm leaving you. You two can live there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's the only wedding gift I can offer. It might fetch about 500,000 dollars if you sell it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Also, I won't be attending your wedding."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was stunned. He had been convinced that Paula would attend his wedding since she had given her agreement to his union with Elsie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instead, Paula only handed him an old, worn-down house and refused to attend his wedding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What was the point of getting married then?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, I'm your son. Why won't you come to my wedding? That's just ridiculous," Frank said, hurt flickering across his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula didn't hide her disdain. "Because she's not the wife I choose for you, but I won't break you two up. As your mother, I respect you and give you the happiness you seek."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula ascended the stairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was at a loss for words. "Frank, don't take it to heart. There's trouble at the company, and Mom's swamped. You came back at a hectic time, with Gale in trouble and Dad in the hospital. Mom's just not in a good place. How could she agree to a rushed wedding?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank looked at the distressed Elsie, feeling her pain. "But I don't want to be apart from Elsie anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie smiled, "What's so hard about this? Have the wedding as planned. Mom not being there won't stop you. Once you have kids, Mom will welcome you back for your children's sake."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her logic was clear, yet Frank developed a gnawing sense of unease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank stood, looking at Elsie. "Elsie, wait here. I'm going to say goodbye to Mom."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie smiled and nodded, softly answering, "Okay. Talk to Mrs. Paula Marsh nicely. Don't get upset. I'll do my best to make Mrs. Paula Marsh accept me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank smiled gently and turned to go upstairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie reassured Elsie. "Don't worry. With me here, your wedding will happen on time. We'll even invite Paige. Don't you love seeing her go crazy with jealousy? Send her an invitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let her know that new love outshines old flames."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie responded with a joyful nod, "Okay! Thank you so much. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be as happy as I am today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie smiled, but there was an enigmatic glint in her eyes. She also wanted to thank Elsie for helping her keep Frank in check.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="260.html">« Prev</a><a href="262.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
