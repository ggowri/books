She should be living her best years carefree on a college campus with her peers, but instead, she'd been by his side, taking care of him while he'd done nothing but hurt her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guilt flooded Steven's eyes, but when she gave him a puzzled look, seemingly not having caught what he'd said, he just smiled faintly, grabbed his coat, and walked out.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana watched him leave, pouting in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had definitely heard Steven speaking, but she couldn't quite make out what he'd said.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana rubbed her nose and went back to washing the dishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing up, she headed upstairs to change before going to pick up Cecil.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Traffic was terrible today - it took her an hour to reach Cecil's villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She and Cecil were the same age, sharing many common interests and quickly finding things to talk about.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Diana was lost in thought, she spotted Cecil coming out.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was wearing a black winter baseball jacket with a cream-colored scarf, glasses, and a face mask, running against the cold wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I'm here!" he chirped as he opened the car door and slid in.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car's heating instantly warmed Cecil up.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil unwrapped his scarf, finally able to breathe freely and relieve his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I hate winter," he complained. "The cold wind stings my face."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mood darkened as he remembered dying in the bitter cold of winter.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana wasn't fond of winter either, but they couldn't do anything. The year had four seasons, and winter had its unique beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana drove away.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's car was behind hers, and watching her leave, he commanded Evan in a cold tone, "Follow them."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan sighed internally. There was an important meeting this morning that Steven was holding from the car, and now they had to tail Diana. It was ironic. Steven used to want Diana nowhere near him, but now he was practically glued to her every move.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan drove them to follow Diana and Cecil to the securities company, watching as they happily left after buying their stocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven glanced at Diana's stock purchase and handed Evan a card. "Buy a billion dollars' worth."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What..." Evan was dumbfounded. "Sir, isn't this a bit rash? The stock is tanking. Why should we buy it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A billion dollars wasn't pocket change, after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's voice was stern. "Just do as I say."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quietly completed the transaction, but even hours later, sitting in the car, his heart was still racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't figure out what had gotten into Steven today and why Diana had suddenly started buying stocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, shall we head to the office now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven gazed out the window. Cecil had bought a cupcake for Diana, and they were sharing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil adjusted the scarf around her neck and broke off a piece of his cupcake to feed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled as she accepted it, their every interaction resembling that of a loving couple.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's gaze turned dark and predatory. He and Diana had never shared such romantic moments.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="713.html">« Prev</a><a href="715.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
