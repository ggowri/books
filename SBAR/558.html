If Jeff couldn't get a divorce, then all her mother's years of waiting would be for nothing. She couldn't let Jeff keep betraying her mother. "Fine! I'll hold back a little longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie opened the door, watching Eric escort a feeble Paula inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She made a show of asking, "Mom, Eric, if this house gets auctioned off, where will we live?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She addressed Paula as "Mom" again, knowing she could still use Eric for her purposes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula didn't bother with the pretense anymore, laughing mockingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, Queenie, calling me 'Mom' again? Didn't you just call me 'Mrs. Paula Marsh' a moment ago? Don't call me 'Mom'&mdash;you're not my real daughter, after all. Go find that lowly mother of yours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calling me 'Mom' just makes me sick."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, her mother really was lowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flash of murderous intent crossed Queenie's eyes. How dare she insult her mother again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, you must have been too upset earlier and imagined things. How could I ever call you 'Mrs. Paula Marsh'? You raised me; you'll always be my mother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie glanced at Eric. This foolish guy still had his uses; she'd deal with him later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears started streaming down Paula's face. This was the same act she'd always used to manipulate Queenie against Diana, just to pave her way to marry Steven and establish herself as the only "daughter" of the Marsh family once Diana was gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Well, Queenie could just wait. The day her film premiered would be the day she'd watch her fall from grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula smiled, saying, "It doesn't matter. Even though you're not my biological daughter, I raised you like one, Queenie. I've done right by you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric chimed in. "Mom, how could you say that about Queenie? She's our only sister, your only daughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in his heart, guilt churned. He thought, "Diana, I'm so sorry. Once this is over, I'll go beg for your forgiveness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie, noticing Eric's naivety, felt pleased. Eric was so easily swayed to her side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spoke with a hint of sadness. "Eric, don't say that. Mom's just been very upset about the company. Once she feels better, she won't talk like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric smiled, trying to reassure her. "Don't worry, Queenie. I'll talk to Mom. Even if her company is gone, she still has you and Dad, doesn't she?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know you care for her deeply. You'll help her out this time, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric looked at Queenie with hopeful eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie paused, surprised at Eric's unexpected boldness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Queenie's silence, Eric turned his hopeful gaze to Jeff. "Dad, why aren't you saying anything? You'll help Mom, won't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff's face turned grim. "Eric, this isn't something I can just fix. Tomorrow, your mother and I are filing for divorce. You kids can all go with her if you want. You and your brothers' careers burn money faster than I can make it, and I can't afford to support you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Eric was shocked. "Dad, we haven't even found Frank's body, and now you're talking about divorce? The moment Mom's business hits trouble, you want to split up? Do you even care about everything she's done for you over the years?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ha! And what about you, you little good-for-nothing? Your mom's in trouble, yet you as her son can't help? I'm old; what do you expect from me? You should've applied yourself instead of becoming a deadbeat," Jeff replied, ruthlessly. His company was his lifeline, and no one could touch that.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="557.html">« Prev</a><a href="559.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
