Your wife hasn&#x27;t come back for days. I bet she&#x27;s off having an affair.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;ve been back for days and haven&#x27;t seen her once. Does she not care about me? And what happened to this month&#x27;s allowance? It&#x27;s suddenly gone.</p><p>&quot;I need that money to go shopping with my friends. What am I supposed to do without those thousands?&quot;</p><p>Jeff, frustrated, looked at Tracey. &quot;Mom, the company is on the verge of bankruptcy. Paula is overwhelmed at work. She doesn&#x27;t have time to take care of you. Stop making things worse.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am her mother-in-law! No matter how busy she is, she should still come home to care for me. How long has it been, and she&#x27;s still not back?</p><p>&quot;She&#x27;s a woman; she should be at home, supporting you and raising the family, not workin! Managing the company should be your job; she&#x27;s should be helping you out!&quot;</p><p>Jeff knew his limitations and said, &quot;Mom, do you think I can handle a company this big? There&#x27;s too much at stake. Even if I&#x27;m her husband, no one respects me. They want a competent leader. What do I have to offer?</p><p>&quot;Stop making a fuss. I&#x27;ll give you 50,000 later, so you can go shopping with your friends tomorrow.&quot;</p><p>Jeff was frustrated. His penis had waned, and he hadn&#x27;t been with a woman in a while.</p><p>He was losing his mind.</p><p>His memory was failing. Just now, he&#x27;d been about to grab something, but after his mother&#x27;s rant, he&#x27;d completely forgotten what he had wanted.</p><p>Tracey was shocked when she heard about the possible bankruptcy.</p><p>In recent years, it was thanks to Paula that the Marsh family had lived so comfortably.</p><p>Even the younger siblings in the family had been enjoying a wealthy lifestyle.</p><p>If Paula went bankrupt, wouldn&#x27;t she be left with nothing in her old age?</p><p>She and her husband received 100,000 every month as spending money, making the people in town insanely jealous.</p><p>For years, the money had arrived punctually on the first of each month.</p><p>She kept 10,000 for herself, while the remaining 90,000 was sent to her grandson abroad to start his own business.</p><p>Now, with this money gone, how would she survive?</p><p>The more she thought about it, the more frightened she became.</p><p>&quot;Jeff, the company can&#x27;t go under. If it does, what will happen to my grandson?&quot; she asked anxiously.</p><p>Jeff replied, &quot;Mom, Paula has been running the company for years and has many connections. Don&#x27;t bother her for now. Once she saves the company, you can have as much as you want.</p><p>&quot;She&#x27;s already exhausted from dealing with the company, and you keep nagging her every day. How does she have the energy to deal with you too?</p><p>&quot;Just stay here in peace. You won&#x27;t lack for food or clothes.&quot;</p><p>Jeff had no time to deal with his mother; his own company was also a mess.</p><p>Tracey suddenly quieted down, realizing that if Paula fell, they would all be doomed.</p><p>&quot;Fine, I won&#x27;t cause trouble. But such a big company can&#x27;t even come up with 100,000?&quot; The more she thought about it, the more nervous she became.</p><p>Jeff lost his temper. &quot;Mom, can you please stop bothering me? My company is being crushed too, and it&#x27;s on the brink of collapse. Stop talking, please.&quot;</p><p>Jeff was overwhelmed and had no time to deal with Tracey.</p><p>Jeff had always been obedient to his mother and had never spoken to her like this before.</p><p>Tracey was shocked by his words.</p><p>She suddenly sat down on the floor, clutching her chest and crying, &quot;Oh, you broke my heart! I&#x27;m your mother! How can you yell at me!&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="304.html">« Prev</a><a href="306.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
