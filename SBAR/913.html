Who would let you manage the Gellar Group? The executives won't agree, and neither will the shareholders."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Diana, and a bloodthirsty malice crept into his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana remained unfazed with steady gaze. "You don't need to worry about that, Mr. Gellar. Those who want to leave can go, and those who want to stay will be well taken care of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for your precious shareholders, it's simple. They can leave if they wish or stay if they prefer. As I said, those who want to go can't be held back. I can't just tie them up and drag them along, can I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George's hands clenched tightly at his sides. "Diana, as long as I'm here, you'll never get the president's position."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt that Diana was unworthy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe it would come to this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George never expected Edward to make such a call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Has Diana been prepared all along? Or is she always certain that Steven wouldn't betray her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whatever the case, George's efforts were turning out to be futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana could see his frustration boiling beneath the surface. "Fine, let's go to the conference room. Just remember, the one who might be embarrassed is you. It's your infidelity that has violated the agreement, and that's why you'll be kicked out of the Gellar Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go. You can follow me to the conference room, but Queenie can't come. She's not part of the company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie interjected, "I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, you stay here and wait for Sir Foliot," George instructed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie understood his meaning. "Alright!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana narrowed her eyes, thinking, "They met with Sir Foliot last night, but I'm prepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sir Foliot secretly acquired shares last night, but it won't matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if the company is split apart today, I'll make sure to hold onto it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie, it's my turn to strike back now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since Sir Foliot is here, Queenie, you might as well join us. If the main character stays behind, the drama loses its flavor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie shot her a cold look, noticing the stark contrast between this calm, and collected Diana and the one she had known before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Diana sat in a wheelchair, her presence was icy, sending shivers down Queenie's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being in a wheelchair, she radiated authority and composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her smile was soft and inviting, yet it instilled fear in Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if everything was already in her grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's prowess and charm as a career woman were perfectly on display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of foreboding crept into Queenie's mind, but she felt reassured by Jace's presence; after all, Jace was well-liked and had a way of winning people over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group made their way to the conference room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie cast a worried glance at George, who returned it with a reassuring smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, unease gnawed at her, growing stronger by the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they reached the office, it was Diana's first time at the Gellar Group's headquarters, but she knew it was on the top floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie, still processing the situation, led the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the conference room door, Dalton waited. He didn't glance at George but turned his attention to Diana. "Ms. Bishop, you're here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dalton, are you blind? Can't you see me?" George snapped, having memorized the names of everyone close to Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dalton, still young and having been with Steven for years, smiled. "Mr. Gellar, I know you, but the Gellar Group is now under Ms. Bishop's leadership. I'm on Ms. Bishop's payroll, working for her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George glared at Dalton with gloomy and brooding expression. It felt as though everything was slipping from his grasp, and yet he couldn't quite pinpoint how it had all unraveled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was equally stunned, thinking, "How have things come to this? We had everything laid out! Now, it all hinges on the shareholders. Soon, that old bastard Andrew will show up, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dalton approached Diana, saying, "Ms. Bishop, everyone is here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled. "Thank you, Mr. Dent. Shall we head in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group entered the office together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spacious, well-lit room was filled with a tense and authoritative air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the left sat the stern-faced executives, impeccably dressed and ready for business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the right were the sharp-eyed shareholders, and their expressions were unreadable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Diana entered, the previously calm atmosphere shifted, becoming thick with tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes turned to her like spotlights zeroing in on the woman in the wheelchair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was unfamiliar to Diana but well-acquainted with Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Steven had never allowed Diana into the office, while Queenie had roamed freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Marsh, it's a pleasure to see you again! When are you and Mr. Gellar tying the knot?" an executive exclaimed, rising with enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smiled but remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's words echoed in her mind, "Queenie, do you know why I let you come and go in my company? It's so you could access the company's secrets."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Steven had known about George all along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic gripped Queenie. "Is today a trap?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then she thought, "Steven is dead, buried at sea. What do I have to fear?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Andrew and Sir Foliot on my side, I can reclaim everything from the Gellar Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph pushed Diana to the head of the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She handed him her laptop and a list, indicating the shareholders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Joseph, check their backgrounds one by one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph nodded, understanding her intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a seat beside her, opened the laptop, and said, "Diana, I can have this wrapped up in a few minutes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Joseph worked, Queenie finally recognized him and was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, how do you know him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph had been the pawn she wanted, a powerful one at that, but he had refused her offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had even tried to teach him a lesson by sending someone to cut off Priya's oxygen supply, which had backfired spectacularly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana feigned surprise. "Do you know Joseph?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie scoffed, saying, "So, you've stolen my man, Diana."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana moved her eyes, intrigued. "Your man?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie replied with rising confidence, "Yes, I saw his potential. I promised him I'd get Priya treatment abroad, but he didn't agree. I didn't expect you to swoop in first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was puzzled, thinking, "When has Diana met Joseph?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's voice turned icy. "Treatment abroad? That sounds lovely, but let's be real. You wanted to send Priya overseas as a hostage, didn't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph had suspected as much, and hearing Diana say it only deepened his resentment toward Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're talking nonsense! I genuinely wanted to help Priya&zwnj;," Queenie protested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana considered it pointless to argue at this stage but couldn't let Queenie continue her antics. Diana had been waiting for this day for far too long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, have you ever thought about how Priya&zwnj; wouldn't survive the back-and-forth travel? She wouldn't understand the language in a foreign country. How would an elderly woman manage? There are plenty of top-notch doctors here. Why not seek treatment for her domestically?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="912.html">« Prev</a><a href="914.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
