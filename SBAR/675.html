Because the treatment was confidential, Tom only brought his assistant with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tom." Diana parked the car and got out of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her anxiousness, Tom comforted her, saying, "Don't worry. I'm here."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took his assistant over and helped Lily out of the back seat of the car. Then, they put her on a moving cart.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them quickly pushed Lily to the examination room.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was eleven o'clock.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven finished the morning meeting and walked out of the meeting room. He looked at the time and looked at his cell phone. Diana didn't call him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Diana left, they had had conflicts. But she would still send him messages to remind him to eat. In winter, knowing that he had a bad stomach, she would always prepare soup for him in advance and wait for him to eat when he returned home.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened his phone and looked at the chat box between him and Diana. It had stopped nine months ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of them had been messages from Diana. He had almost never replied or just responded with "okay" casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven threw his phone away in annoyance. He thought, "Was this how I treated Diana in the past?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There are lots of men in the world. Even without me, there would be more men competing to be nice to Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She is beautiful and good enough. Once she is willing, many men will stay for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in my life, only Diana was willing to stay for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But last night, Diana told me that it was her fault because she was young and reckless and did not listen to advice.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It is precisely because of that that she becomes so precious."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven sat in the office chair. He thought that they could go back to the way they were before once Diana moved back.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But...</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven closed his eyes, hiding the emotions in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Diana and Cecil seem to have some connection."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, there was a knock at the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven suddenly opened his eyes and looked towards the door. Then, he said in a low voice, "Come in."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan walked in and said, "Mr. Gellar, Ms. Marsh is here and wants to see you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was annoyed. "Tell her to get out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, you have really changed. Queenie is the woman you love the most. How could you ask her to get out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen walked in with a frivolous smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing under the light, wearing a white coat, he looked extremely handsome. He exuded an air of nobility.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned. "Why are you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I came to see you. Recently, several noble families in Capitole have been making a lot of moves. Even your ex-wife..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Owen, she is not my ex-wife. She is still my wife."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen was so angry at his words that he laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Steven's unhappy face, Owen mocked, "When Diana used to be your wife, you were always cold, saying that she wasn't your wife and that the person you want to marry was Queenie."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven shuddered. He stood up abruptly as if he couldn't accept that such words could have come out of his mouth. "Owen, don't be ridiculous. I said no such thing."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen shook his head. "You did. But you can't remember it yourself. You said something like that when you came to us for a drink after Queenie had left."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven clenched his hands and thought, "Did I really say that?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Do I really like Queenie?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, I don't like Queenie. It's Queenie's occasional detachment that gives me the wrong feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan once reminded me that what you don't get is the best.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie actually knows that I don't love her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She doesn't love me either. All Queenie loves is the five million dollars I give her every month.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did I repay the wrong favor, but I did those things to my rescuer."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven asked indifferently, "What are you looking for me for?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="674.html">« Prev</a><a href="676.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
