He knew Diana had likely left Capitole by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would be away for half a month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was in an irritable mood and asked the waiter to come over to take the order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked out the window. It was still snowing heavily, and his handsome face had a complicated expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I will repay you for the rest of my life," he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana watched TV series for two hours and had a preliminary plan for her future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had clearer priorities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Men were distractions, obstacles to her success, and she was intent on filtering them out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she was about to take a rest, a new message arrived&mdash;it was a video from a servant of the Marsh family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula had finally started a feud with Jeff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Paula knew very well how to deal with Jeff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula's company had gone bankrupt and was sold off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the money was used to plug financial holes. The video showed exactly what was happening at the Marsh </span><span>F</span><span>amily Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after selling the company, it wasn't enough to fill the gaps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That afternoon, court officers came to seize the mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This frightened Tracey and Leopold, as well as Queenie and Jeff, who were completely bewildered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff looked at the two court officers and said, "What are you doing? Why are you seizing my house?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had lived here for over a decade, and the villa had beautiful surroundings, with a garden in the front yard filled with his favorite flowers. It was a dream villa he had moved into at twenty-five and never wanted to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the older men replied, "Sir, Mrs. Marsh's company has incurred massive debts. Most of her assets need to be auctioned, and this villa is included. You have a week to vacate so we can proceed with the auction."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Jeff turned to Paula and yelled furiously. "Paula, what is this supposed to mean? Wasn't your company doing well? How could it end up with such huge debts?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula, looking frail, hadn't eaten in two days to make herself appear even more worn out. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cried. "Jeff, you know business has been tough these past two years. After Azure Group pulled their investment, we lost over a hundred partners. With no one investing, I had no choice but to take out bank loans."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only recently did I discover that someone has been luring our partners away in secret, which led to my company's downfall. Who could be so shameless as to stab us in the back like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula glanced reluctantly at the villa behind her. "Now, I've sold this villa and two other properties. I still owe about one billion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jeff, the company under your name was a gift from me. We'll need to sell it to help pay off these debts, or we'll be left with nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff trembled with anger, shaking his head in disbelief. "No, that's impossible. How could you have racked up so much debt? What on earth have you done?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes blazed with fury. He hadn't been well recently and had been resting at home. He had no idea she'd put the company in such a state, let alone accrued a billion in debt. Was he now expected to shoulder this burden with her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula had used his health issues to divert his attention, allowing her plan to succeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued to cry. "Jeff, Queenie, please, help me. Jeff, your company is worth about a hundred million. If we sell it, I can fill another gap."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff was stunned, speechless, as he looked at her in disbelief.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="550.html">« Prev</a><a href="552.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
