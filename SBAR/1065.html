Why are you so stubborn? One day you'll understand that bullying women never ends well."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"To be honest, I've realized over the years that women are trouble, and making money is the only right path. But, Owen, it's too late for you to regret now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Owen could respond, two police officers quickly approached him, restraining his hands so he couldn't move.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A stout police officer walked in, looking sternly at Owen. "Mr. Toby, we've received a report accusing you of rape. Now, please come with us to the station for investigation."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen angrily said, "I didn't. It was that woman who deliberately came here with me last night. She consented. I didn't rape her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Roger directly called the police without stating his terms for one reason only&mdash;they didn</span><span>'</span><span>t want to offer any terms but aimed to completely take over the Toby family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen struggled a few times but couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t break free. He was even hit a few times. All his strength was instantly drained. Glaring at Roger, he said, </span><span>"</span><span>Roger, I</span><span>'</span><span>m already in police custody. Why don</span><span>'</span><span>t you tell me who wants everything my family has?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Roger looked at him as if he were a fool. Who would reveal their scheme in front of the police?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He shook his finger and said with a smile, "Owen, I don</span><span>'</span><span>t know what you</span><span>'</span><span>re talking about. If you have something to say, tell it to the police. If you feel wronged, let the police help you uncover the truth."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen struggled slightly, his tailored suit wrapping around his strong body. He bent slightly, exuding a wild aura. Looking at Roger, he sneered, "Roger, I have a long life ahead, but you don</span><span>'</span><span>t have many days left. Some people aren</span><span>'</span><span>t worth it. You</span><span>'</span><span>ve gambled your wife, but you</span><span>'</span><span>re just a pawn in her hands. Soon, what I</span><span>'</span><span>m facing today will be your fate."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Owen wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t angry. He just felt he hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t been vigilant enough, allowing them to frame him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His fate could be ruined by his own hands, but no one else could use him as a stepping stone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen knew very well how capable Roger was and understood that without someone helping him, he couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t have come up with such a sinister plan, even gambling his wife.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Roger frowned slightly, but he just snorted coldly without saying anything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen was taken away, but Diana's stunning face appeared in his mind. Her lively eyes were so beautiful, as if they could pierce through one's soul.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He also thought of the words he heard that night, realizing that Diana had long known Queenie was going to target him and Yanson.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie didn</span><span>'</span><span>t need them on her way up. She used a dictatorial approach, treating everyone around her as her stepping stone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen closed his eyes. Amid the reporters' cameras, he was taken downstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, he thought of Steven siding with Queenie and realized he had no chance of winning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Queenie acted too fast. My dad once warned me that Queenie wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t simple and told me to be careful, but I still got framed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Owen's here!" someone shouted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When everyone rushed over to scold Owen, Diana arrived too. As soon as the car stopped, Luna got out and took Diana's wheelchair from the trunk.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had already opened the car door and was waiting.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven glanced at the scene and noticed there were many people. He reminded Diana, "Diana, there are a lot of people here. Be careful."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana replied, "Okay, I got it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Luna helped her sit in the wheelchair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana quickly said, "Hurry! Let's go over and take a look. I want to scold Owen too. He's yelled at me many times, and today I want to yell at him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna smiled helplessly and said, "Alright, let's go now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was very helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked through the window at Owen, who was surrounded by a group of abusers, slightly frowned, and thought, "Queenie has finally made her move on him. He can't fight back at all."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Toby, how can you be so shameless? You actually had a relationship with your elder. Can you tell us how you feel about it?" a female reporter angrily asked Owen, almost shoving the microphone into his face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen was furious. "Get out of here. The truth hasn't been clarified yet, but you deliberately ask like this. Did someone bribe you to ask such questions? Even if I enjoy having fun, I would never disregard morality."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But everyone in the live stream saw you two lying on the same bed. Why are you still trying to deny it?" the female reporter sharply pressed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone even threw a bottle of mineral water at Owen's face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Owen, you bastard, go to hell!" a man shouted, angrily waving his arms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man used too much force. A bump instantly formed on Owen's forehead. It hurt a lot, but he stood there silently because anything he said now would be in vain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Diana felt her heart soften again. Seeing Owen in such a miserable state, she suddenly couldn't bring herself to scold him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen opened his eyes and saw Diana's clear gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana froze, thinking, "Why is he looking at me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen was slightly stunned, thinking, "Am I seeing things? Why do I see Diana?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Blinking, Owen clearly saw Diana sitting in a wheelchair through the crowd insulting him. She still looked cold, just quietly watching him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen quickly shouted, "Diana, help me! You don't want her to take my company and become stronger, do you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Diana, he instantly regained his composure. However, he was very surprised by what he had just said, thinking, "What did I say?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he felt that what he just said was the most correct thing he had ever said in his life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was stunned, thinking, "I just wanted to see the scene. Why would he say that? Does he want me to create trouble for myself? Owen is so shameless."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Owen's words were very true. If Queenie took over Owen's family company, she would become stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If I save Owen, I might gain an ally. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Queenie is hard to deal with. I do need help to completely take her down."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen kept staring blankly at Diana, waiting for her decision. "Diana, I underestimated you before. I always looked down on you, but later I realized you are the strongest among us. Diana, I apologize. I'm sorry!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shyly waved her hand and modestly said, "You don't have to do this."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen was stunned, thinking, "Why is she being modest at this moment?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Diana, I know Steven has already turned against me, and you're the only one who can help me. As long as you help me find the evidence, once I'm out, I will definitely help you too. I won't lie to you. Please trust me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Through the crowd, Diana looked at his anxious expression and smiled, "Owen, it seems your eyes aren't blind anymore. Why were you so blind before?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana waved her hand and said, "Alright, go to the police station first. I will help you fulfill your wish."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1064.html">« Prev</a><a href="1066.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
