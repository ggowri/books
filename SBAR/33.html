"What are you planning to do?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold also lowered his voice and growled, "Steven, don't you dare interrupt my granddaughter's date. If you want to eat, go to another restaurant. I've booked this one just so my granddaughter can have a good date.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Can't you see how happy my granddaughter is? When she was with you, she was wronged and mistreated.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This man here is the perfect match for her, someone I handpicked. If you dare interfere, I'll expose everything Queenie has done and send your little childhood sweetheart to jail."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven frowned at the old man in front of him. He was wearing a gray suit, his eyes sharp and deep. He seemed ordinary, but there was something about his gaze that suggested otherwise.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sir, please do not slander Queenie, or I'll be sending you a lawyer's letter."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven sounded serious, clearly not joking, his entire demeanor filled with intensity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold laughed. "Go ahead. I dare you. This place doesn't welcome you, so leave!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven frowned but was pulled a little closer by Olivia. "Come over here. Don't let Diana see you. Don't ruin her mood."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia only hoped that Diana would fall for another man and have a good future, which was something Steven could never give her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was about to speak but was met with a fierce glare from Olivia.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven swallowed the words that were on the tip of his tongue.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He and Diana hadn't finalized their paperwork yet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Technically, she was still his wife, so how could she dago on a date?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Powell, if you ever need someone for a business collaboration at Capitole, could you consider me first? I'm in fashion design. I speak five languages, and I can also do translations. I've heard you're in the antiques business, and I also do antique restoration and medical consultations."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the big shot, Diana quickly started to promote herself. After all, this man would become a super tycoon in the future.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It would be a good idea to build a good relationship with him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander looked at her with some surprise. Her eyes were bright, and her smile was beautiful. So far, she was the most stunning woman he had ever met.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, this beautiful woman regarded him as a potential client, not as a man&hellip;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During their date.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took a sip of water to suppress the astonishment in his eyes, then smiled, "</span><span> </span><span>If I'm not mistaken, we're on a date.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled shyly. "Mr. Powell, could you not consider me as a blind date but rather as a business partner or a friend?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've been divorced once, and I know I'm not worthy of you. Right now, I just want to focus on my career."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was a bit surprised. He liked her a lot. "I don't mind," he said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Diana was confused. What didn't he mind? </span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="32.html">« Prev</a><a href="34.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
