Sitting beside her, he tried to comfort her, "Mom, don</span><span>'</span><span>t think like that. Diana told you about Queenie</span><span>'</span><span>s plan because she cares about you. I still remember when Diana first came back, she was so cautious with all of us. She noticed our health issues and worked hard to help us recover. We couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t see her kindness, but we believed Queenie</span><span>'</span><span>s lies instead."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric let out a bitter laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie kept using lies to frame Diana, and they, blinded by their prejudice against Diana, kept believing Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, all of this was their own doing. No matter how much they regretted it, they could never get the old Diana back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric only hoped she could live a peaceful life, and that she would find happiness with Steven, the man she loved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The one who regretted the most was Gale. Because of Queenie, he lost Althea and his son.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He kept his head down and said nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t stop crying. All she felt now was endless pain and regret.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With tears streaming down her face, she said, "The first time Diana told me your father had a woman outside, and that Queenie was his biological daughter, I had my doubts. I did two paternity tests, and both came back negative. Later, she suggested I go to a hospital neither the Barnes family nor the Marsh family knew about for another test. That</span><span>'</span><span>s when I found out the truth. Queenie really is his daughter."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t believe her before. I said the cruelest things to her. It wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t until the third paternity test came back, and I followed your father, that I realized he really was cheating. He</span><span>'</span><span>d been keeping that woman for over twenty years. This was a complete sham marriage."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t until then that I believed Queenie and Jeff wanted to take the Barnes family</span><span>'</span><span>s money and even kill you all."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By the time I uncovered their scheme, it was almost too late, because the four of you are just so unbelievably stupid."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula looked at Gale and said, "Gale, Diana told you not to race. She said Queenie would tamper with the car to cause an accident. Even when I told you about it, you didn</span><span>'</span><span>t believe me. You even sent men to assault your own sister. I can</span><span>'</span><span>t ask for Diana</span><span>'</span><span>s forgiveness anymore. Outsiders adore her, and yet we hurt her like this."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula always thought that if she tried hard enough, she could earn Diana</span><span>'</span><span>s forgiveness. Now, she realized she had lost her daughter forever.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven didn</span><span>'</span><span>t do anything to directly harm Diana; he just helped Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale and Eric both deeply regretted what they had done to Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula grew even angrier. "Steven is the worst of all. He knew Queenie</span><span>'</span><span>s plan, so why didn</span><span>'</span><span>t he tell me? Why let me wrongly blame Diana?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula could only pin the blame on Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana would never be able to let it go.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale said, "Mom, you can</span><span>'</span><span>t blame Steven for this. We were on the same side as Queenie, and he knew it. No wonder he</span><span>'</span><span>s been so distant with us all these years."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula just felt foolish. Steven had never said he wanted to marry Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Diana left, he still refused to get a divorce.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She should have seen back then that there was something between them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was her blind confidence, thinking the Queenie she raised would never do anything to hurt her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula had given Queenie the best love she could.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t even devoted herself to raising her four sons.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She spent half her life by Queenie</span><span>'</span><span>s side, just to ensure she married well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Queenie showed no gratitude.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula's regret was useless now. Diana was never coming back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She regretted it deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric looked at Paula with concern and said, "Mom, Diana told you about Queenie's schemes because she didn</span><span>'</span><span>t want the Barnes family</span><span>'</span><span>s lifelong efforts to be ruined by Queenie. She still cared about you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric held Paula gently, trying to comfort her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula looked at them and said, "Gale, Eric, you must work hard. I've hired professional tutors to teach you how to read contracts and handle business deals. It's not too late now, but you have to take it seriously. Stay vigilant."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, the Barnes family could only rely on them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t count on Frank, and Dylan was just too foolish.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric's eyes filled with tears as he said, "Alright! Mom, I understand. I</span><span>'</span><span>ll take it seriously. Dylan</span><span>'</span><span>s been hanging out with his friends these days. He</span><span>'</span><span>s not even working on the deals he</span><span>'</span><span>s supposed to. I</span><span>'</span><span>m really worried about him too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan was Eric</span><span>'</span><span>s younger brother. Eric was deeply worried about him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, they just needed to get Dylan thrown in jail. That way, Queenie would have no one left to use, and the people she was secretly manipulating would finally surface.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula thought about Steven showing up in public today. She was sure it must have unsettled Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula guessed that Queenie would take the chance to have Dylan steal the company</span><span>'</span><span>s secrets.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Eric, check the company</span><span>'</span><span>s surveillance right now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric said, "Got it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He grabbed the phone on the desk, opened the app, and instantly accessed the office surveillance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He froze for a moment. There was someone in his office.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The office lights were off. Dylan held a flashlight in his hand. The window was behind him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The city lights outside flickered occasionally, casting brief glimmers on his face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was crouching sneakily in the archive room, snapping photos of files one after another, looking thrilled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric couldn't hold back his tears.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan had really gone through with stealing company secrets.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric said, "Mom, Dylan is truly vicious. The files he's photographing are all company secrets. If they get leaked, the company will be ruined."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric looked at Paula with tears in his eyes and said, "Mom, what do we do now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was prepared, waiting for Dylan to walk right into the trap.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula looked at Dylan in anguish but said firmly, "Stick to the plan. Send him to prison."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's the only way to set him straight. He has to pay for what he's done.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric understood what Paula meant and said, "Alright!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He picked up another phone, made a call, and then headed to the office with Paula.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan, after finishing the shoot, walked out happily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, the lights near the office flickered on.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the police rush in, Dylan's eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was quickly surrounded by the police. Glaring nervously at the two officers in front of him, he asked, "This is my company. What do you want?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1092.html">« Prev</a><a href="1094.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
