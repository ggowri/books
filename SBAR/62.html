And he will definitely be very rich in the future. You work hard. We make a good relationship with him, and we can make a lot of money in the future.&quot;</p><p>Cecil said nothing.</p><p>Rich?</p><p>They made a good relationship with Alexander?</p><p>Did the dignified young master of the Farley family need to do this?</p><p>But Diana was right. Alexander was young and promising. They could make a good relationship with him.</p><p>An intriguing smile appeared on Cecil&#x27;s handsome face. He looked deeply at Diana.</p><p>He understood something. Steven couldn&#x27;t see the excellent Diana. Instead, he wanted to marry that vicious woman, Edison.</p><p>&quot;Diana, have dinner with me tomorrow night. My grandma also wants to meet you. Although you slapped me ten times that day and disabled my hands, my grandma said that I&#x27;d grown as a result.</p><p>&quot;She said she wanted to thank you and invite you to meet her.&quot;</p><p>Diana was speechless. No one would be grateful to the person who beat him.</p><p>She was surprised.</p><p>In the previous life, because of Queenie&#x27;s instigation, Cecil never showed mercy to her.</p><p>Diana said, &quot;Okay! The night after tomorrow, I will go see her and help her check if there is any residual poison in her body.</p><p>&quot;The bodyguard has woken up and is in my car. You can take him back later. He is not seriously injured, but his leg bone is crushed and fractured. He will be able to work normally after three months of rest.</p><p>&quot;He was the one who carried me to the hospital on his back. I was very grateful to him, so I treated him. &quot;</p><p>Cecil finally knew everything that happened that day.</p><p>He smiled and stared at her. &quot;Okay! Diana, thank you!&quot; Cecil left with the bodyguard.</p><p>Olivia came over and asked, &quot;Diana, you let Steven and Queenie go like that. They are in the same group.&quot;</p><p>Steven was helpless.</p><p>Why did Olivia say this?</p><p>He and Queenie were in the same group?</p><p>&quot;Yeah! I know they are in a group, using me for entertainment to satisfy their bad tastes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But you also know that even if I send Queenie to prison, Steven will find a way to save her.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Steven is so deeply in love that I actually want them to be together as soon as possible, and I can get the divorce as soon as possible.&quot;</p><p>This was what Diana thought.</p><p>Of course, Queenie couldn&#x27;t go to prison like this. Diana also had to lure out the person behind Queenie.</p><p>That person was the most terrifying.</p><p>Steven was angry and thought, &quot;Did Diana think so too?&quot;</p><p>Olivia reminded Diana, &quot;Diana, because of Queenie, even your loved ones will be hurt. You must stay away from her, including Steven.&quot;</p><p>&quot;If you want, I can cut him off for you.&quot;</p><p>Diana said, &quot;No, Olivia. You will be retaliated against. What Steven did to me has made me give up. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether you help me or not. I will run away from this person as far as possible.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Let&#x27;s go. My brother said he would buy us something delicious tonight. If we go back now, we&#x27;ll just be there when he comes back. I also asked him to bring you your favorite shrimps.&quot;</p><p>Olivia looked at her deeply. &quot;I really don&#x27;t know what to do with you.&quot;</p><p>Diana looked at her with a smile. &quot;Let&#x27;s go!&quot;</p><p>The two left.</p><p>Steven had a sad look as he thought of the first time he met Diana.</p><p>She was young and energetic.</p><p>&quot;Hello, Steven. my name is Diana.&quot; After saying this, she blushed.</p><p>Was Diana really going to give up on him?</p><p>Steven was unwilling to accept the girl who had loved him said she didn&#x27;t love him anymore. Could she really do it?</p><p>Steven was annoyed. He thought of Alexander. Was that man so outstanding in Diana&#x27;s eyes?</p><p>Steven thought, &quot;What was so special about Alexander that she actually praised him so much?</p><p>Humph! Diana, you will always be my wife.&quot;</p><p>On the way back, Steven saw Diana&#x27;s excited expression and her beautiful eyes that looked at him clearly, seriously and full of love.</p><p>The scene changed. He thought of Diana who was in so much pain this afternoon, and the scene where he brought her back to the Marsh Villa.</p><p>Unexpectedly, it turned out to be a show directed and acted by Queenie herself.</p><p>Steven thought, &quot;Was Queenie lying when she said Diana was plotting against her?&quot;</p><p>Steven had a cold look. He was afraid that he was going to lose Diana.</p><p>He looked at Evan who was driving. &quot;Evan, haven&#x27;t you found where Diana lives yet?&quot;</p><p>Evan shook his head. &quot;We can&#x27;t find it, sir. Our men have failed to follow her, and they have failed every time.&quot;</p><p>Steven didn&#x27;t speak.</p><p>Evan witnessed the whole process of what happened tonight.</p><p>Queenie was so vicious.</p><p>In order to drive the real daughter out and enjoy everything in the Marsh family, Queenie would do anything.</p><p>Evan knew that!</p><p>He saw through Queenie&#x27;s character at a glance.</p><p>But Steven, who loved Queenie, couldn&#x27;t see it clearly.</p><p>Evan turned on the radio and deliberately chose to listen to a novel.</p><p>What a coincidence. The story was about the real lady and the fake lady.</p><p>The content played was probably about the fake young lady being afraid that the real one would take away everything from her.</p><p>Then the fake young lady framed the real one in various ways, and finally the real young lady was kicked out by her parents...</p><p>Steven was stunned.</p><p>Evan saw Steven&#x27;s gloomy face in the rearview mirror and quickly turned off the sound.</p><p>Evan was also confused. How could it be such a coincidence?</p><p>Steven&#x27;s face was gloomy. And he couldn&#x27;t utter a word.</p><p>*****</p><p>In the Marsh Villa.</p><p>Queenie and Jeff watched the two men leave through the back door.</p><p>When Queenie got home, she didn&#x27;t see Paula. She was very nervous. &quot;Dad, where is Mom?&quot;</p><p>Queenie was afraid that Paula would no longer believe her.</p><p>Jeff&#x27;s face was gloomy. &quot;Maybe she&#x27;s upstairs.&quot;</p><p>Queenie didn&#x27;t forget about the tonic. &quot;Dad, tonics need to be taken every day to work. Dad, give it to her. As long as she has Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, we will be successful soon.&quot;</p><p>Jeff nodded. &quot;Yes! Go to Steven early tomorrow morning and say that you do not know what happened today. You put all the blame on Diana. Anyway, he has always trusted you. After you coax him, he will always trust you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Dad, don&#x27;t worry about Steven. No matter what I do, he will forgive me.&quot; Queenie was very confident about this.</p><p>Jeff was relieved. &quot;Okay, okay. I&#x27;ll go make some medicine and give it to Paula for another half a month. Slowly she will develop Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.&quot;</p><p>Queenie smiled and said, &quot;Dad, my mom Amelie has been waiting for this for more than 20 years. Don&#x27;t let her down again.&quot;</p><p>Jeff rubbed her head and said, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry. We will be happy.&quot;</p><p>Queenie went back to her room to rest, and Jeff went to the kitchen.</p><p>Paula, who was hiding under the stairs, heard the conversation between Jeff and Queenie. She was so scared and surprised that she covered her mouth with disbelief.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="61.html">« Prev</a><a href="63.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
