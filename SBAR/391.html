Upon discovering he is still alive, Queenie might frame us for what happened today. I went back to the hotel to change clothes and saw Steven and Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She is filming and is also on the island."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige trembled. The mention of Queenie scared her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was incredibly scheming!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, Diana, I'll listen to you. I'm really afraid of Queenie's tricks. You know how hellish my previous experience was."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige had learned her lesson. Now, it was not time to fight back. Lacking the ability to defeat Queenie, she could only distance herself from her. In any case, for her safety, there was no shame in doing so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Realizing that she was afraid of Queenie's frame-up, Diana asked her to arrange a few people to send Frank to the hospital under her name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After he had been transferred, it was already dark, so Diana and Paige went to the beach for dinner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without Frank, Paige felt much more relaxed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had been here for some time and was very familiar with the restaurants on the island.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She took Diana to a familiar restaurant. Unexpectedly, they ran into Queenie and her friends at the entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige felt unlucky to meet Queenie and wondered why she was everywhere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie spotted Paige and Diana and knew that Frank was in the hospital. She called Elsie, but no one answered. Elsie escaped with the money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had chased Elsie all the way. Queenie was unsure if Elsie had told him about her plan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It failed because of Paige and Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie invited the crew to dinner tonight. She was good at building good relationships with those around her by giving them small gifts, treating them to dinner, and showing her concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She smiled, "Diana, Paige, why are you here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She deliberately expressed surprise and fear in her voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man next to her was the male lead of the movie, a well-known actor, Levi Robinson. Noticing her nervous expression, he frowned slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie, they might frame you again. Be more careful."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Penelope's belly was bulging. She stood up, pointed at Diana, and scolded, "Diana, you always stalk Queenie. When will you stop causing harm to her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige was furious. "Penelope, you are ridiculous. Diana never stalked Queenie. She always has a high profile. Her whereabouts are known to all. Diana was here yesterday. Why are you blaming her?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="390.html">« Prev</a><a href="392.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
