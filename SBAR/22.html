Since I have been reborn, I&#x27;ll live my best life!&quot;</p><p>Confused, Olivia looked at Diana, trying to understand her.</p><p>Diana panicked at the thought of her abilities. She didn&#x27;t even know why she had been reborn; perhaps it was due to enduring too much suffering and her determination to seek revenge.</p><p>She avoided Olivia&#x27;s gaze anxiously.</p><p>Olivia frowned and looked at her meaningfully. She had been reborn. No wonder she couldn&#x27;t see Diana&#x27;s fate clearly.</p><p>She thought to herself, &quot;Diana, what on earth has happened to you that would make you to say such things?&quot;</p><p>Olivia leaned against Diana&#x27;s shoulder, enjoying the barbecue and browsing through her phone.</p><p>&quot;It seems that someone is fanning the flames?&quot; Olivia noticed some paid trolls were deliberately misleading people to provoke criticism against Diana.</p><p>Thankfully, Diana could handle it.</p><p>Being the successor trained by Leopold, she was proficient in everything.</p><p>However, it was a shame that Diana was a hopeless romantic and sometimes acted ridiculously.</p><p>Reflecting on how Diana accommodated Steven, Olivia sighed.</p><p>She earnestly patted Diana on the shoulder and advised, &quot;Diana, please get over Steven this time. If you keep buttering him up, we won&#x27;t be friends anymore.</p><p>&quot;You are so young. You should keep your options open. There are plenty of men out there.</p><p>&quot;Think about it, is it worth giving up the entire world for someone like Steven?&quot;</p><p>Diana couldn&#x27;t help but nod at her opinion.</p><p>Wearing a bright smile, she replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t want that jerk anymore. Just let Queenie have him. They&#x27;re a perfect match.&quot;</p><p>With those words, Diana drank beer.</p><p>She took a sip of beer and then took a bite of the food, feeling very satisfied and relaxed.</p><p>The following day, Diana woke up in Olivia&#x27;s bed.</p><p>She clumsily flipped over and, fortunately, ended up rolling under the bed.</p><p>&quot;Ouch!&quot; Diana woke up in pain.</p><p>Olivia suddenly opened her eyes and found Diana with one leg on the bed and the rest of her body hanging off, her hair disheveled.</p><p>Her funny look amused Olivia.</p><p>She burst into laughter as she sat up quickly.</p><p>Embarrassed, Diana curled her lips and wondered what was wrong with her.</p><p>Luckily, it was just Olivia who saw her mess.</p><p>Slowly getting up and looking at the sunlight streaming through the window, Diana felt a surge of enthusiasm and vitality.</p><p>A new day had arrived, and she was determined to give her all in the upcoming battle tonight.</p><p>In this life, she would be domineering and carefree!</p><p>After having breakfast, Diana messaged Leopold: [Grandpa, there&#x27;s a party at the Farley family tonight, and I&#x27;m planning to beat someone up. It might raise your blood pressure if you see it, so please don&#x27;t come.]</p><p>Leopold replied: [You&#x27;ve already cured my sickness, so there&#x27;s no need to worry. I want to be there to watch it.]</p><p>Diana read the message and shook her head, realizing that Leopold simply enjoyed joining in on the excitement. She shouldn&#x27;t have sent him the message in the first place.</p><p>Just as she was pondering this, Leopold sent another message: [If you didn&#x27;t want me to attend, why did you message me? Are you trying to pique my curiosity? You did it intentionally.]</p><p>Only then did Diana realize her mistake.</p><p>Ignoring Leopold&#x27;s message, she went shopping with Olivia and treated herself to a skincare session at a beauty salon. Returning to Breeze Villa, she adorned herself with the luxurious diamond jewelry Leopold had prepared for her, which she had never worn before.</p><p>As she looked at herself in the mirror, Diana saw a stunning reflection, reminiscent of her appearance from a few years ago.</p><p>She felt like an angel, gentle and sweet, just like every girl should be.</p><p>For a moment, Diana got lost in her memories. Before she was about to return to her biological parents, Leopold had said, &quot;Sweetie, I truly care about you. I have one request, though. Don&#x27;t reveal your true identity to your parents. If anything goes wrong, come back to me anytime. You will always be my dearest granddaughter.&quot;</p><p>Back then, Diana foolishly believed that she would be loved by her biological parents. With Leopold turned away, she firmly followed Paula back to the Marsh family.</p><p>At that time, Leopold knew the pain she would experience, but Diana was too naive to understand anything.</p><p>Diana laughed at herself, realizing that the family affection she once believed in was actually the beginning of her destruction.</p><p>From now on, she would never let it happen again. Whether Paula believed her words or not was no longer her concern.</p><p>She would no longer care about how her four brothers and Steven were being destroyed by Jeff and Queenie.</p><p>Since her rebirth, Diana had two main goals.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="21.html">« Prev</a><a href="23.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
