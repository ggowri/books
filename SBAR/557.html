It's cold out here; let us handle things."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his many faults, Jeff took good care of his parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula stood up, her movements slow and strained, a glimmer of defiance in her gaze. "Jeff, I won't divorce you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'd rather die than divorce you! You said you loved me; you said you loved me, Jeff! You can't abandon me when I'm at my lowest. Everyone will condemn you for this, Jeff..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough! Paula, it's not that I don't want to help you&mdash;I just can't. If you owed a couple million, we could pay it off together, but your debts are way beyond that. How do you expect me to cover this for you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tomorrow, we're getting a divorce. Whether you go or not, it's happening."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff entered the house, with Queenie trailing right behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, Paula collapsed into sobs, her cries tearing through the silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she'd steeled herself for this moment, the pain hit her with unexpected force, suffocating her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sobbed openly for the tragic farce that had become her life, mourning years of misplaced love and misplaced trust. But she vowed to herself that these would be her last tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the divorce was final, she could finally live freely, while their nightmare was only beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, Mom!" Eric's voice broke through her thoughts. He rushed over, finding her sobbing there in the icy air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart clenched seeing her like this, yet he was unable to help her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The company's troubles were far beyond anything he could help fix despite his best efforts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catching sight of him, Paula stifled her cries, her voice dropping. "What are you doing back here? You need to leave, right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric shook his head, choking on his own tears. "Mom, I get it now. I know I was wrong. I understand you sent us away back then to protect us. But we're grown up now, and you don't have to shield us anymore. From now on, let me protect you, alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the sincerity in his eyes, Paula felt the welling of fresh tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eric, don't you see? Queenie is still after you. How could you be foolish enough to work as her driver?" Looking at his sincere expression, she decided not to keep things from him. This was her son&mdash;her own flesh and blood. She knew his heart was in the right place, and she couldn't stop worrying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, please don't worry. I have a plan. Staying close to her, I can look for proof of what she's done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't waste your time, Eric. You won't find anything. She's ruthless, and she's careful. I discovered her embezzling millions long after she'd covered her tracks. She never leaves a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now isn't the time. She has powerful people backing her. When they finally make their move, that's when we'll strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Until then, keep playing your part as her driver. This will be a lesson for you, a chance to grow stronger. I've lost everything, so maybe it's time for me to finally rest. After so many years, I think I deserve that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had worked so hard these years and had never been nice to herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric gently helped his mother to her feet. "Mom, let's head inside. It's freezing out here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula nodded, and they walked to the door, only to find it bolted from the inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric gave the door a hard shove, anger flashing in his eyes. "Mom, they've locked us out&mdash;they're trying to shut us out completely now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula sneered, pounding on the door. "Jeff, if you want a divorce, open this door. Otherwise, we'll stay here and never get divorced."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Inside, Jeff glanced over at Queenie, irritation flickering on his face. "Queenie, let her in. If she leaves now, I'll have to hunt her down tomorrow just to get the divorce settled."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="556.html">« Prev</a><a href="558.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
