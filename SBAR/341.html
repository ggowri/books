Her eyes were almost bloodshot as she stared at Steven.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana comforted her. "It's okay. Just ignore him."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven turned to look at Luna. "I haven't offended you. Why are you so hostile to me?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna cursed without any hesitation, "Because you are a bastard!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven frowned but said nothing in the end.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No matter how he tried to clear himself, he was still bad in front of them.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana drove back to the city. She went straight to the nearest hospital and let Steven get off.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Gellar, this place is safe. You can take a taxi and leave. I want to take Luna to the hospital."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was stunned. Once, he had been going to look for Queenie and left her on the way. It turned out that this feeling was really uncomfortable. He said in a low voice, "I'll go with you."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shook her head and refused. "No. You said that I am healthier than Queenie and can do everything. Queenie is a weak woman. Go to accompany her. Luna is very angry when she sees you."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven automatically ignored her taunting and was puzzled. "How many bad things did you say about me in front of her to make her hate me so much?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana laughed angrily. "Mr. Gellar, I'm not a gossiper. Luna hates you because she investigated everything that Queenie and you did to me. She knows a lot of the truth better than I do. She hates you for a reason."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was stunned, thinking, "So that's how it is."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana helped Luna to the hospital. Steven called Evan to pick him up.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had an emergency meeting tonight.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven stood by the road waiting, thinking about what had happened. He thought, "Queenie's move got Cecil arrested and made Diana hate me even more.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She even wants to snatch Diana's life-saving grace. I really underestimated her."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Steven had not expected Queenie's way of survival.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the hospital, Diana sent Luna into the examination room.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was waiting outside the door.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana sat on the bench a little tiredly and saw Alexander sending her a message.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Diana, where are you?]</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana quickly replied: [Alexander, I'm fine. Don't worry about me.]</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander: [I'm glad you're fine. I didn't find you when I left.]</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana: [I'm okay.]</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She smiled. Alexander's concern made her feel warm.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Leopold sent her a message.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Sweet pea, I'm having a lot of fun here. I want to stay here for another month before going back. Take good care of yourself at home.]</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana: [Grandpa, just do what you want to. I am fighting monsters here. It is so interesting.]</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Leopold: [Well! My sweet pea has finally grown up. Sweet pea, do whatever you want to do. I will always support you.]</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana felt warm inside when she saw the messages Leopold sent her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Thank you, Grandpa!]</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled happily.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was a noise outside. Diana stood up to see.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the dim corridor, two doctors were standing against the wall. A man was kneeling on the ground. He was so far away that Diana could not see his face clearly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana walked over and heard the boy's painful plea. "Doctor, please save my grandma. She is all I have left. Please save her. I will definitely collect the surgery fee tomorrow. Please save my grandma."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="340.html">« Prev</a><a href="342.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
