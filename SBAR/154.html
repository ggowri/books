I have 5% here, and I will have 30% of the shares, which is more than Paula's shares.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Then we can take over the shares held by the other three idiots and take over the company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Fortunately, when Diana came back, we had been framing her, so Paula didn't give the shares to Diana out of guilt. Otherwise, we would be in trouble now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie knew that Jeff valued money more than family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He could lose the newborn Diana and he also could abandon Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie thought, "Only when the power is in my hands will he dare not say anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">I will kick these people out one by one and become what I want to be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">I knew very well that Jeff values money more than life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sure enough, a hint of surprise flashed across Jeff's eyes. "Queenie, let's do this. When your eldest brother gets into trouble, transfer his company's shares to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Outside the door, Paula heard their conversation and turned away angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula arrived downstairs at the hospital and saw people coming and going into the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She felt sad that her husband, whom she trusted the most, and her daughter, whom she had loved since childhood, wanted to kill her entire family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Hehe..." Paula sneered. The autumn wind blew and she felt her eyes hurt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She shed tears silently for a while and called Gale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mom, is Queenie feeling better?" Gale asked nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula said angrily, "She won't die."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mom, I know you are angry. I will go and get Diana to apologize to Queenie right now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale's voice sounded very angry, and Paula was shocked. "Gale, did you get kicked in the head by a donkey? Why do you blame Diana for your mistakes? If you didn't find someone to teach her a lesson, would the following things happen?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What did I teach you? You made a mistake yourself. What does it have to do with Diana? Gale, Queenie and you are the culprits. If you dare to go find Diana, then you will never return to the Marsh family, because you are also a bastard. Your life or death has nothing to do with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula felt disappointed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mom, what do you mean? I'm your biological son. I just want to teach Diana a lesson..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Gale, Diana is your biological sister. You hired someone to rape her. How much hatred do you have to do this to your own younger sister? She will hate you for the rest of her life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Humph! Half a year ago, she plotted against me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What happened half a year ago was not done by her and Althea. Before Althea left, she explained to me that she was the victim. Considering the friendship between our two families for many years, you should be grateful that she didn't sue you. Why do you always believe Queenie? If she asks you to kill someone, will you do so? Gale, how can you be so stupid?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale was stunned. "Mom, how could you believe what they said? I'm already in her office. Mom, I'm hanging up first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula looked at her phone and cried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula thought, "It's all my fault!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It's all my fault!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Bang..." The door of Diana's office was kicked open.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna and Diana were talking about work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale stared at the gorgeous office for a moment, then remembered the purpose of his visit. He shouted, "Diana, come with me to the hospital to transfuse blood to Queenie."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana said in a cold voice, "Luna."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna walked over quickly, jumped up suddenly, and kicked Gale in the stomach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Bang..." Gale fell to the ground in a daze, looking at Luna in horror.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="153.html">« Prev</a><a href="155.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
