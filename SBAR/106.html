"What do you mean by that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I wonder you've lost your memories, haven't you? I've signed divorce papers with Steven. Stop bothering me with such bullshits, okay?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Go get married as you wish. PDA is disgusting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Please never ever call me again. Understand?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie was stunned. She checked the phone number. It was indeed that of Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What's with her attitude?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Shouldn't Diana be pissed off and curse me for being shameless?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie stomped her feet in anger, but her tone was smug enough, "Diana, did you hear what I said? Tonight, we're going to discuss my engagement with Steven. My mum wants Steven to marry me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"So what? You want me to congratulate you? Alright, congratulations."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana wasn't sad at all. That man had disappointed her completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Come back tonight to finalize the divorce. Steven wants it to get done tonight. If you didn't show up, others would accuse me of bullying you again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana couldn't help but sneer. "Who do you think you are? I felt reluctant to hurt you because I used to see you as my family. Now that you're nothing to me. If you dare hurt me a hair, you would regret being alive."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"How dare... you threaten me!" Queenie stomped her feet in anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana sneered. "So what? I'll do whatever I want."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana hung up the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She thought for a moment and unblocked Steven's number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then she dialed it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven answered immediately seeing it was from Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Queenie called just now, saying you wanted to divorce me and marry her. That's great. I'll wait for you at the Civil Affairs Bureau tomorrow morning at nine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana hung up abruptly, and blocked his number again in no time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven tried to call Diana, only to find that he had been blocked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His handsome face darkened. Queenie deliberately called Diana, saying he wanted a divorce?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A cold light skimmed across his eyes. Had he been deceived by Queenie?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Since she dared to hurt Diana behind his back, what else couldn't she do?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As for Diana, after blocking Steven's number, she had a great time with the other two.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After surfing in the afternoon, Tobias took them for a seafood feast on the island.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the afternoon, Steven visited the Marsh Villa with Evan to find out the truth behind his mother's suffering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula was at home busy preparing dinner, hoping that Steven and Queenie's engagement would be secured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven walked in, his aura inherently intimidating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This man had always been cold and stubborn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula watched him grow up, knowing well what he had been through in his childhood. He had been cold since childhood, not knowing how to show care about others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His father wasn't a decent husband, who spent all his time outside in clubs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His mother vented all her anger on Steven to revenge on her husband.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There were still many scandals she didn't know about that scumbag.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Steven, you're here. Go to the dining room. Queenie personally cooked you many delicious dishes," Paula praised Queenie with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven looked at Paula with a nod, "Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He walked towards the kitchen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula stared at his tall, straight figure. "Nobody can stop him if he shows his ruthlessness. Such a man is well-suited for a woman as vicious as Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her daughter Diana deserves a gentle and kind man," she thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had never seen Steven being soft. He was always cold whenever she met him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Steven, you're here." Jeff greeted him with a warm smile, his tone somewhat ingratiating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven nodded and sat down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Dressed up elaborately, Queenie put on a show by carrying out a dish when he arrived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Steven, you're here." Her smile and voice couldn't be sweeter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"So&hellip;what&rsquo;s your evidence about why my mum fell ill?" Steven asked.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="105.html">« Prev</a><a href="107.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
