Come with me, come with me. Tonight, I&#x27;m gonna rock your world.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">That cocky, over-the-top arrogance? Yeah, that was pure Cecil—when he was himself.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The whole room went still.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana&#x27;s stomach dropped.</p><p style="text-align:left;">What in the actual hell?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cecil had been keeping a low profile for over a year now—no women, no scandals. So, where was this &quot;woman&quot; coming from?</p><p style="text-align:left;">There was something seriously off about this.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The two bodyguards gripping Cecil hesitated, clearly thrown off by his words.</p><p style="text-align:left;">One of them stepped up, his voice low but firm. &quot;Mr. Farley, you might want to think about what you&#x27;re saying. We&#x27;ve been with you all night. This is the first time you&#x27;ve seen this woman. She&#x27;s not yours. You haven&#x27;t had a girlfriend for over a year. You&#x27;ve only been around Ms. Bishop and Ms. Laurier—no one else. We don&#x27;t know this woman. She drugged you. You need to wake up.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Tch!&quot; Lillian scoffed, folding her arms. &quot;And who exactly gave you the right to comment on Mr. Farley&#x27;s personal life?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana&#x27;s brows pinched together. &quot;Cecil, you say she&#x27;s yours? Then tell me—what&#x27;s her name?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The sound of Diana&#x27;s voice seemed to cut through the haze. It was familiar, grounding—like an anchor in a storm.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He gasped, like a drowning man finally breaking the surface. &quot;Diana, help me! A woman is trying to set me up. It—it smells so sweet, I can&#x27;t think straight.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Lillian&#x27;s eyes flickered. She gave her wrist another subtle shake.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The bell&#x27;s chime rang out again, crisp and clear, curling through the air like a whispered command.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mr. Farley, it&#x27;s me, Lillian Everhart. Don&#x27;t you remember? You forced me. You tried to make me do things I didn&#x27;t want to. Upstairs—you grabbed my hand, wouldn&#x27;t let me go. I barely managed to escape. Have you already forgotten what you did?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Before Cecil could react, Diana&#x27;s voice cut through. &quot;Ms. Everhart, are you seriously trying to seduce a man who&#x27;s clearly out of it?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Lillian turned, her gaze as sharp as a blade. &quot;I&#x27;m not seducing him. I&#x27;m just reminding him.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana leaned back, her expression unreadable, gaze sweeping over the men in the room.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Why don&#x27;t we ask the gentlemen here? The way you were talking, the way you moved—tell me that wasn&#x27;t meant to reel a man in.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">A beat of silence.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The men in the crowd shifted, some casting awkward glances at their partners, others avoiding eye contact altogether.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But the truth hung thick in the air.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Then, a woman in the back snorted. &quot;Seduction? Please. Look at her, all desperate and theatrical. If you ask me, this whole thing is a setup. Cecil probably wasn&#x27;t interested, and she decided to spin it into a whole &#x27;poor me&#x27; act. Women like her? They know exactly what they&#x27;re doing.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana exhaled, relieved someone was willing to call it like it was.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The Farley name carried power, wealth, and status. People envied it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">And in situations like this? If someone saw a chance to take Cecil down, they&#x27;d jump at it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Lillian&#x27;s lips curled, her tone dripping with venom. &quot;Lady, maybe if you kept a better handle on your man, you wouldn&#x27;t need to blame other women for &#x27;tempting&#x27; him. Ever considered that? Maybe instead of whining, you should ask yourself why he&#x27;s looking elsewhere.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The woman&#x27;s face darkened, her jaw tightening.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Oh, honey, I know I&#x27;m not twenty anymore. But let&#x27;s see how you look when you hit my age. You think being young gives you the right to be a little viper? That youth makes you untouchable?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;And honestly? Women like you don&#x27;t last. You either wise up or you burn out—fast.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Lillian rolled her eyes, unimpressed. Great. Now, she had to deal with a woman going through a midlife crisis. Waste of time.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Things were so close to going her way.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She wasn&#x27;t about to waste breath on nobodies. She turned back to Cecil. &quot;Mr. Farley, you just admitted it. You wanted to hurt me. Now, in front of everyone, do you dare say it again?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">One step closer. One inch at a time.</p><p style="text-align:left;">All she needed was for him to say it. One confirmation and his reputation would never recover.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She moved just slightly—her wrist flicking again, just enough for the bell to chime. Diana&#x27;s eyes narrowed. She had been watching every movement, every word.</p><p style="text-align:left;">This was the third time Lillian rang that damn bell. Why did Cecil only seem panicked when Diana spoke, but completely docile when she did?</p><p style="text-align:left;">What the hell was going on?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana watched as Cecil&#x27;s gaze turned vacant, his eyes losing focus.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A sinking feeling crept into her chest—was he being controlled?</p><p style="text-align:left;">The thought had barely formed when Cecil suddenly shouted, &quot;That&#x27;s right. I want you.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana&#x27;s fingers clenched around the armrest of her wheelchair.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The words landed like a bomb.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The crowd collectively held its breath.</p><p style="text-align:left;">And then, Queenie smirked. Diana might be smart, but she&#x27;d never be as ruthless as her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana pressed her lips together, her mind racing. Where the hell was Luna?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Why wasn&#x27;t she back yet?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Lillian&#x27;s voice wobbled, just enough to sound pitiful. &quot;Did you all hear that? He admitted it! He admitted that he wanted to humiliate me! But what did I do to deserve this?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Just because someone has money and power, does that mean women like us don&#x27;t matter?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;They say Cecil likes playing games with women, but if this is what he does in public, imagine what he&#x27;s like in private.&quot; A voice came out of the crowd.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;How many women has he done this to? Women too scared to speak out, because the Farley family is too powerful?&quot; another chimed in. &quot;But this woman—she&#x27;s different. She got away. And she&#x27;s standing up for herself.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You don&#x27;t have to be afraid, sweetheart. We won&#x27;t let him get away with this.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">A middle-aged man stepped forward, voice ringing loud over the murmurs.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Lillian turned to him, dipping her head, her expression pure gratitude. &quot;Thank you, sir. I&#x27;ll never forget your kindness.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her face was soft, innocent. But her eyes—sharp, calculating, unwavering.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana&#x27;s grip tightened around her wheelchair. Her gaze was ice-cold.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cecil&#x27;s bodyguards darted frantic looks in her direction.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana didn&#x27;t need to hear them beg—she knew they were in deep trouble. And so was Cecil.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She turned back to Lillian. Something was off with this woman.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Why the hell was Cecil following her lead so easily?</p><p style="text-align:left;">She was lost in thought when Lillian suddenly turned to her. &quot;Ms. Bishop, now that Mr. Farley has admitted it, do you have anything else to say?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana let out a thoughtful &quot;hmm&quot; and tilted her head. &quot;Well, since you asked... yeah, I do.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Lillian&#x27;s eyes flickered. &quot;What?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="1022.html">« Prev</a><a href="1024.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
