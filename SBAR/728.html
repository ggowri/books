She was sleeping deeply, her steady breathing making the room feel cozy and warm.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven knew she was a heavy sleeper. He carefully slipped into bed, pulling the soft blanket over them both and pressing close to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lying beside her, holding her warm, soft body, he knew he'd sleep well tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No childhood nightmares would haunt him. None of that messy baggage would surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven realized that despite having only shared a bed twice, he was already addicted to her presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was addicted to Diana's pure and passionate nature.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's cold and lonely heart found peace in this moment. As he drifted off to sleep, a smile played on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana woke to the urgent ringing of her phone the following day.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had slept deeply last night, utterly oblivious to the world around her. If there was one good thing about her, it was that she always slept soundly and woke up refreshed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She fumbled for her phone on the nightstand and answered, her voice still thick with sleep. "Hello!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna said, "Diana, are you still sleeping? Quick, check the news. Something's happened."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was still groggy - winter always made her sleep like the dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She forced her eyes open and looked out the window. Finally, there was some sun today, though it was blindingly bright.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Luna, what are you doing up so early instead of sleeping?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sighed helplessly, "Diana, all hell's broken loose."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shot up in bed, asking in surprise, "What do you mean all hell's broken loose? Whatever it is, someone else can deal with it."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna was exasperated - she really appreciated how Diana usually wasn't boy-crazy. "Diana, Queenie's pulled something disgusting. Check the news first, I'm heading over."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana frowned slightly, remembering Queenie's words about giving her quite a show this morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana quickly clicked on the news notification.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was ten in the morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was surprised she'd slept in so late.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She saw that Queenie had held a press conference.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie looked worn out, her lengthy hair falling loosely around her shoulders, wearing a pink coat. Her tears made her look utterly pitiful. What a perfect picture of a damsel in distress.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My dear friends from the media and my beloved fans, I've called this press conference today to clarify something. I am not pregnant. This whole situation stems from my sister Diana's grudge against our father for abandoning her. Ever since she returned to the Marsh family, she's been plotting against me. This time, she's gone too far, willing to destroy my reputation, ruin my life, and sabotage my upcoming film just to bring me down.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She leaked false information about my pregnancy and collaborated with Mrs. Foliot to attack me. I was just a baby when all this happened. I had no say in what occurred. I understand it's unfair that she was taken away by our father and abandoned. Growing up in the countryside has made her incredibly jealous.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She can't stand my success and wants to destroy me. Let me be clear. I am not pregnant, I have not betrayed Steven, and I have absolutely nothing going on with Mr. Levi Robinson! We played lovers in the film, and yes, I visited his room, but only to discuss scenes and practice lines. His assistant was always present.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I really had such a scandalous private life, would I be confident enough to release these videos? The truth speaks for itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yet Diana uses these same videos to smear my name.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's my sister, my half-sister, and I didn't want to be too harsh. But she's determined to ruin my life, and I have to stand up for myself. To those who spread rumors about my pregnancy, please leave me alone. I just want to be an actress and do my job well. I hope everyone will recognize my work."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she cried even harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reporters tried to console her, suggesting she shouldn't waste energy feuding with some country girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The comments section exploded with criticism of Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was stunned by this situation.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="727.html">« Prev</a><a href="729.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
