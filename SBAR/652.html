"Ms. Barnes, what nonsense are you talking about? Why would I need to 'let Diana go'? I haven't done anything to her. I didn't interfere with your company, so why did you say that to everyone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula responded with a bitter laugh and pushed Steven away. "Steven, you're practically willing to give your life for Queenie. Without your help, could she have taken over my company?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's lips curled into a mocking smile. "Ms. Barnes, I wouldn't stoop so low. I had nothing to do with Queenie's takeover of your company."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine! Even if you weren't involved, then divorce Diana. I know Queenie is the one you've always wanted to marry. You love her like she's your whole world. Just marry her already and leave Diana alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streamed down Paula's face as she pleaded. It was the only thing she could do for Diana. "Steven, I took care of your mother for years. Can you not spare Diana, just for that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Years ago, when the company faced a crisis, Edward demanded Steven marry Diana, and Queenie ran away.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula had sided with Queenie then, pushing her own daughter into the fire, watching as Diana walked into that pit with her own hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's lips twitched with a cold smile. "Ms. Barnes, mind your own affairs. What happens between my wife and me is none of your business."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life, he would never let Diana go.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was determined to make her love him the way she used to.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula cried helplessly, watching Steven leave, completely powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Diana was having dinner with Cecil.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She enjoyed the steak tonight; it was quite good.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She finished one piece and drank a glass of water, reminding herself not to overeat. Lately, she had been indulging a bit too much and had gained a bit of weight.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil noticed and asked, "Diana, why are you only eating one steak? Can that fill you up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana frowned slightly and responded, "It's winter."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil looked confused, staring at her intently.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not understanding, he asked, "What about winter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sighed, looking troubled. "Every winter, I gain 1.5 pounds."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Cecil laughed heartily. "Diana, you're hilarious. You're so thin, and you're worried about dieting? Have you heard the wind outside? If you lose another pound, it might blow you away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was clearly slender, yet she was worried about gaining weight.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana touched her slightly rounded belly and shook her head, resisting the temptation. "No, you can't tempt me anymore. Just focus on eating. Losing even one pound is hard enough. I'm not eating more."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil tried to place a shrimp on her plate, but his fork was suddenly stopped by another hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil looked up to see Steven's dark, brooding face staring down at him. He turned to Diana, feigning fear. "Diana, look! He's scaring me. His eyes are so cold. I'm really scared."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil acted as if he were genuinely frightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was amused by his appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Steven, who stood quietly, exuding a wild allure that was hard to ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's gaze was complicated as she looked at him. "Mr. Gellar, if you have something to do, please go ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eyes remained fixed on her. His voice was deep and unwavering. "You are my date tonight."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="651.html">« Prev</a><a href="653.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
