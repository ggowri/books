Diana happened to pass by, introduced herself as a doctor, and successfully saved Sam's wife and child. Both mother and baby were safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This incident quickly spread online, making headlines and overshadowing Queenie's recent award buzz.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie, who had orchestrated a car accident to prevent Diana from taking Paige to the hospital, hadn't anticipated that her actions would backfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of stopping Diana, the event catapulted her into fame as the most admired doctor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Queenie was lying in a hospital bed, weakened by the icy seawater and receiving IV fluids.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven addressed Diana, his tone heavy. "Diana, there's no need for further investigation. This was Queenie's doing. She also orchestrated the attack on Ms. Sutton. Evan stumbled upon her accomplices in the parking garage. They panicked, kidnapped him, and tried to silence him for good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana drew in a sharp breath. The only reason Queenie dared to commit such blatant acts of kidnapping and murder was because Steven indulged her without limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She let out a cold laugh. "So? Are you telling me this because you want Paige to forgive Queenie's crimes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven let out a sarcastic laugh. He knew that at this point, no matter what he said, Diana wouldn't believe him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I've already explained about the design plans. I never gave them to her. As for today's events, I won't let her off easily. But it's not as simple as we'd like. She has powerful backers. Besides, she was with me at the time and can deny everything. The men who took Evan will bear all the blame."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stared at him in silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the suffering Paige endured..." she thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could speak, Steven's voice dropped. "I already made her experience what it feels like to be tossed into the sea. The pain Paige went through...I made Queenie go through it too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said nothing. She turned to Luna. "Luna, you just took your medication. Rest for a bit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna nodded. "Okay, Diana. Don't worry about me, I'm fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good." Diana left the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven followed her out, stopping her in an empty corridor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She frowned as he blocked her path. "Mr. Gellar, do you still have something to say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Ms. Sutton alright?" Steven asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "She's fine. She's sick from the cold and on an IV."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven relaxed slightly. That vile woman, Queenie, truly had no limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two stood in awkward silence until Steven spoke first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana..." he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her frosty gaze made him swallow his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have things to do," Diana said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll wait for you to go back together," Steven offered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "There's no need..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She almost added that she would never return to his place, but the memory of Tobias' warm smile stopped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You go on ahead. Don't wait for me. As for Queenie, I know you're shielding her. I can't touch her now, but one day, I'll watch both of you fall into hell together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She believed the wicked always faced their reckoning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't believe someone as malicious as Queenie would live a long and happy life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised a clenched fist toward Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven couldn't help but chuckle, but a deep sadness lingered in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl who once looked at him with nothing but love, the one who had risked her life to save him, now wished him dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana headed to the maternity ward to check on Carolyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn was still asleep, the baby lying peacefully by her side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Diana left, she fed the baby formula. The little one dozed off contentedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Diana reached the ward's doorway, a figure suddenly lunged at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The harsh sound of the slap echoed as Diana received a hard slap on the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's gaze darkened as she stared at Janet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet's eyes burned with rage. "You wretched woman! How dare you ruin my plans! I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana pressed her tongue against the inside of her cheek, her expression icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stepped closer. Janet flinched at the cold fury in her eyes. "Don't... don't come near me," Janet stammered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana moved swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She struck Janet's face and followed with a sharp kick to her stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet collapsed to the ground in a heap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..." Janet cried out in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's anger was a storm as she grabbed Janet by the collar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was a furious roar. "Janet, you dare say I ruined your plans?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You drugged Carolyn, left her unconscious in the snow, and wanted her and her baby dead. You're despicable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up! You have no proof it was me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes were like daggers. "Your own words gave you away. Your plan was to ensure Carolyn and her baby wouldn't survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're vile!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet sneered though her voice wavered. "If not for you meddling, my plan would've worked. That hick from the countryside didn't deserve to marry Sam. She got lucky with college and met Sam, but so what?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sam was rich. Why would he marry a country girl?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what gives you the right to take her life? Carolyn earned her place through hard work and love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Meanwhile, you? As an adopted daughter, the Young family raised you. Sam cared for you, yet you repay them with treachery? You even want to kill his child. You're the one who doesn't deserve anything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had seen humanity's darkest sides before, but Janet's cruelty boiled her blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You nosy wretch! You should mind your own business." Janet knew that everything was irreversible now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam had already sent people to investigate her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was done for, and she wanted to take Diana down with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Janet!" Sam's icy voice cut through the corridor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned to see him standing behind her, his face a mask of fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She let go of Janet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet scrambled to her feet, trembling. "Sam..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't. From now on, I'm no longer your brother. I believed in your kindness, but you turned out to be a monster. You tried to kill my wife and child, embezzled company funds and sent fake messages and videos to drive a wedge between us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Young family gave you everything, yet you betrayed us, wanting to get everything we have. You don't deserve anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet's body shook as tears streamed down her face. Her hands balled into fists, her veins throbbing with tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't want to admit. She believed that the evidence had all been destroyed by her, and she could deny everything. She stammered, "No, Sam, it's not true. You must believe me. These are lies!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="866.html">« Prev</a><a href="868.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
