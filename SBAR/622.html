Unlike him, Levi was very talkative. She felt very relaxed when they were together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Levi's sexual skills were very good. After making love with him, Queenie could relieve her stress. Each time, she was sore all over, but she really found comfort.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had a lot on her mind. He didn't come back, and there was no one to help her out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But being with Steven only depressed her. She had to be careful in her dealings with him all the time, and it was tiring.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confused, Queenie asked curiously, "Steven, since you already know everything, why did you still accompany me to act before Diana?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She really didn't understand Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was too difficult to control him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's tone was cold, and his deep eyes were unreadable. "Have you forgotten that you saved me? I have always regarded you as my sister. I will take care of your business. Since it is your request, I will invest, but you can't let my money go to waste."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie, narcissistic, assumed that he still had feelings for her and thus made up an excuse to help her.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled brightly, "Steven, Levi and I didn't do anything when we met. We just discussed the plots. Why did you believe those rumors?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite this, she still felt that Steven had become very strange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was no longer the man she was familiar with before. He was even harder to control now because he started to trust Diana, not her anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, we definitely can't have dinner at this restaurant, but I really want to eat the casseroles. After all, Diana and Cecil are alone. Aren't you worried?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was still eager to snatch Diana's reservation and was willing to do anything to upset her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven said nothing and took her in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana and Cecil had already ordered. Without the interruptions of Steven and Queenie, she felt much better.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when she was about to talk to Cecil about foreign maternal and baby products, Steven and Queenie came in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven even sat next to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Queenie took her seat beside Cecil.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana and Cecil were both stunned. Steven and Queenie were so shameless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glared at Steven. "What are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He replied calmly, "There are no empty tables. Let's eat together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was speechless. "Mr. Gellar, aren't you powerful? In the past, in order to let Queenie eat quietly, you even booked the entire restaurant. What is wrong today? Why do you allow your love to share a table with us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tone was incredibly sarcastic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie felt extremely embarrassed. Steven's previous pampering had made her feel that she was the happiest woman in the world.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he no longer doted on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was lost in thought, Steven said, "Diana, if you like to eat quietly, I can also clear the restaurant for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was gentle, but his eyes were deep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was taken aback. Was he willing to do this for her</span><span> now</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was jealous. After figuring everything out, was Steven going to give Diana all the care he had shown her before?&#8203;</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="621.html">« Prev</a><a href="623.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
