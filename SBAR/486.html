"So what if we're married? We're in the process of getting divorced. I made you dinner out of kindness, and this is how you treat me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's expression suddenly darkened. He stared at her with an intense, suffocating gaze. "Diana, I told you, we will never get divorced in this lifetime&mdash;unless I'm dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine! You'll die anyway. I'll wait for you to die and then get married again. I'm young. I can afford to wait. There's no way I'm staying with an old man like you," Diana retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned, his eyes glinting as he thought irritably, "Did she really just call me old? And did she actually wish for me to die?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana, </span><span>ignoring</span><span> his grim expression, quickly lowered her head to check herself. Seeing that her clothes were still neatly on, she sighed in relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven, watching her obvious relief, felt a deep frustration rise in his chest as he wondered, "Do I really look like some monster who would do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, once you're ready, we'll fulfill our marital duties," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrified, Diana stepped back, confused by Steven's sudden madness. She begged, "No, please, go bother Queenie, not me! I remember on the day we got our marriage license, you told me I could have the title of Mrs. Gellar, but neither your heart nor yourself would ever be mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Steven, please stick to your principles and don't break mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not going to sleep with a man who doesn't love me, and who I don't love either. Last night was an accident. I was injured, took some medication, and slept like a rock. But you were fully aware, and what you did really made me despise you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing her piece, Diana climbed out of bed to freshen up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven took a deep breath and pondered, "Did I really say something like that? I don't even remember, but why does she remember it so clearly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided to skip work today. Diana's bed was soft and smelled nice, and he found himself unwilling to leave. He laid back down and quickly fell asleep, likely lulled by her unique scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Diana came back from the bathroom and saw that Steven had fallen asleep again, her eyes blazed with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He fell asleep again?!" Diana wondered and was so angry she wanted to throw a pillow at him, but she thought better of it and decided to go downstairs for breakfast instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grabbed her phone from the bedside table and saw several missed calls. She knew they were from Samuel's side, but she didn't rush to return them. After all, it was Samuel's parents who were in a hurry, not her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Diana went downstairs, Daren was already in the dining room, and he said, "Ms. Bishop, hurry and eat your breakfast. The family doctor has arrived and will be able to start your IV soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled and replied, "Alright, Daren. Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're too kind," Daren said and went off to handle other matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana headed to the kitchen, had a bowl of oatmeal and a glass of lemonade, and then called for the family doctor to begin the IV. She lay down on the couch, one hand hooked up to the IV, and with the other, she dialed Cecil's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, are you feeling better today?" Cecil asked the moment the call connected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, "Much better, but I'm still sore all over. I'm getting an IV right now. How are things with Wyatt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil's voice turned cold and wicked. "Diana, Samuel's been arrested. Wyatt's family is in complete panic. They can't find you, and they couldn't get through to your phone. They came straight to my place first this morning, all frantic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew Samuel's father wasn't someone to be taken lightly, but since he and Queenie were in cahoots, she had no plans of letting him off the hook easily either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see. I'll wait for the police to summon me before I go in," Diana responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil's tone softened, sounding concerned. "Diana, make sure you get some rest. Don't worry about Wyatt's side of things&mdash;I'll keep an eye on it for you."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="485.html">« Prev</a><a href="487.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
