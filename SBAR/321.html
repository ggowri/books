She wore a pink maternity dress and had her hair tied up in a high ponytail, looking gentle and lively.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana drove the car off the ship and saw Althea.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She asked in surprise, "Althea, why did you come personally?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea opened the car door and got in. "I was waiting for you here, and I also came to buy seafood. The crabs here are very delicious. I planned to cook for you. But these crabs are so big, you need a hammer to crack them open, so I also bought a hammer."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea put her things away and then fastened her seatbelt.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled and drove back.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea was surprised. "Diana, I saw you fighting back. Queenie's ugly face was seen by tens of thousands of people. Diana, before we were too weak. We were too kind. When dirty water was splashed on us, we could only shout."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled, "When dirty water is thrown at us, there's no such thing as being clean anymore. Only by fighting back can we prove ourselves.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Althea, I want to tear off her mask. I want to send her to hell."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was filled with anger.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea knew that among them, Diana had suffered the most. She was kind-hearted and didn't want to make things too ugly for the family, so she chose to endure.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But those people couldn't be reasoned with.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Enduring only led to more bullying.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Marsh family couldn't be reasoned with. Her mother insisted on moving, which showed her better judgment.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sometimes she thought that growing was too painful.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana said, "Queenie wants to be successful in the entertainment industry. She will cling to Jace. Last time, Jace protected her. This time, I think he'll do the same."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea was puzzled. "Why?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shook her head. "I don't know, I just have this feeling. We'll have news tomorrow."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jace's kindness to Queenie might backfire, but no matter what dirty water was thrown at her, she would take it.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In this life, she would not let Queenie grow strong.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She added, "Althea, my current designs are for a high-end domestic brand. Part of it is sold online through live streaming. I collaborated with Paige. I have nothing to do today, so I'll stay with you for a few days."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she was free, Queenie would get busy.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just thinking about it made her feel great.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea was very happy. "I'm about to give birth. My mother will be here in a few days."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana said, "The temperature on the island is just right now. It won't be too cold for giving birth."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After giving birth to the baby, it will start snowing here. I'll go back to the city to live. I plan to quit my job at the company here. After the baby is one year old, I'll let my mother take care of the baby, and I'll go to the company to work with my father." Althea had her future all planned out.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana thought her idea was good. "Althea, life is short. Let's live the way we like."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea smiled, "Yeah. I'm living the way I like now, but having a child makes me feel more fulfilled. As a woman, you must become a mother once. Everything else can be given up.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even men can be given up. We can be happier on our own."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana thought of the unborn child from her previous life, and her chest ached.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="320.html">« Prev</a><a href="322.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
