Everything she knew about him was just surface-level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She spoke honestly, "What I know about him comes from my past life. In that life, I saw him as the most powerful man in all of Capitole."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In my hazy memories, it seemed like Queenie's company eventually failed too. So in this life, after I returned and not long after we parted, Leopold introduced him to me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Back then, I had a different plan. If I wanted to take on you and Queenie, I needed someone stronger than both of you. So, I chose Alexander. I went to meet him for a date that day, but I hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t divorced you yet. I made it clear to him that we could only be friends."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Later, because of work matters, he would occasionally invite me out for dinner."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aside from that, there was no deeper connection between them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was always busy. She often heard about him traveling for business.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When he returned, he'd bring her gifts she liked, but she never thought much of it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven had been worried she had feelings for Alexander. Hearing her words now, he instantly felt relieved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Diana may have made things clear to Alexander, but Alexander doesn't seem to get it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Knowing Diana won't divorce me, he'll only push harder to get close to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Alexander's eyes, he saw that Diana had tried to set boundaries, but Alexander didn</span><span>'</span><span>t seem to grasp it. Knowing Diana wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t divorce him, Alexander would only become more relentless, driven by his possessiveness over her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Men are always sharp when it comes to rivals. Alexander was clearly impatient to claim Diana as his own.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven fell into deep thought. After a long pause, he finally asked, "Diana, how much do you remember about Alexander from your past life?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head. "I don</span><span>'</span><span>t know much. After Queenie became a business queen, I was finally free to leave you. But I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t go anywhere&mdash;I stayed in the villa. I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t want to see anyone from the Barnes family again, though I</span><span>'</span><span>d catch glimpses of them in the news sometimes."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the end, it was Alexander who succeeded. He became the wealthiest man in Capitole, dominating the business world both at home and abroad."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Later, George died. That</span><span>'</span><span>s when I returned to Queenie</span><span>'</span><span>s parties."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana didn</span><span>'</span><span>t seem bothered. Sometimes, knowing too much wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t a good thing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven frowned, murmuring to himself, "Why was it Alexander and Queenie who ended up on top?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her master mutter, Diana glanced at him sideways. "It</span><span>'</span><span>s not surprising. Business is unpredictable&mdash;survival of the fittest. You lost. Isn</span><span>'</span><span>t that just how it works?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven chuckled and reached out to pat her head. But then, he suddenly remembered&mdash;Alexander had just done the same thing earlier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes burned with fury. "Diana, stay away from Alexander from now on."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana chuckled lightly. "I was keeping my distance. It was Alexander who came over. I</span><span>'</span><span>m not a fan of being that close either."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She always felt there was something off about Alexander.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t pinpoint what was wrong, so she didn</span><span>'</span><span>t dwell on it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Aren</span><span>'</span><span>t you going to the office today?" Diana tilted her head, looking at him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven took her hand and asked, "Do you really want me to go to the office?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t thought about it that way. She was just worried he</span><span>'</span><span>d exhaust himself managing the company later.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, I</span><span>'</span><span>m just worried you</span><span>'</span><span>ll pile up too much work and tire yourself out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven chuckled. She was worried about him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh, by the way, Diana, this is the wedding ring I bought earlier. Do you like it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven reached for it, but Diana didn</span><span>'</span><span>t even glance at it. "Don</span><span>'</span><span>t bother. I don</span><span>'</span><span>t like it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's hand paused mid-air. "You didn</span><span>'</span><span>t even look at it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "I know your taste isn</span><span>'</span><span>t great. Honestly, back when I was dreaming about marrying you, I had already designed our wedding rings. But then... a lot happened, and I gave up. Now, I don</span><span>'</span><span>t even know where those designs ended up."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven opened his mouth but stopped himself. He could never seem to get it right.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then let</span><span>'</span><span>s design them together," Steven said, feeling ashamed. So Diana didn</span><span>'</span><span>t like the diamond ring after all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at him with a hint of amusement. "We haven</span><span>'</span><span>t even started over yet. Why would I design wedding rings?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana." Steven</span><span>'</span><span>s voice grew tense. Seeing the faint smile on her face, he realized she meant every word.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t started over yet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought they had already started over during this time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana patted his shoulder lightly. "Don</span><span>'</span><span>t overthink it. I haven</span><span>'</span><span>t agreed to start over with you yet. Thanks for taking care of me these past few days. I chased you for years&mdash;now it</span><span>'</span><span>s your turn to chase me for a while."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven chuckled. "Alright! I</span><span>'</span><span>m fine with that."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was furious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She shot to her feet. "Hmph! I</span><span>'</span><span>m done talking to you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, she stormed upstairs in a huff.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's expression shifted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Did he say something wrong again? Why was Diana upset this time?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Women are just too complicated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna and Evan were getting anxious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna glanced at Evan. "Steven's such an idiot. No wonder he doesn't have a wife."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan was anxious. He and Luna were planning to get married in April. They wanted to have a daughter, and Steven's drama couldn't be allowed to delay their plans.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was almost 30; he should</span><span>'</span><span>ve had kids by now. People his age already had children in grade school.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm just as frustrated. Mr. Gellar is so clueless."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had to step in and help Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, how can you be so dense? Women are tough on the outside but soft inside, especially Mrs. Gellar. She's been hurt so much, all because of you. Yet, she's still sharing a bed with you. She's already forgiven you, she just can't bring herself to say it. Can't you take the initiative? Do you really expect Mrs. Gellar to admit she forgives you? After everything she's been through, she can't say it out loud."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven frowned and asked, "Then what should I do to make her happy?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan said, "Wasn't Mrs. Gellar really happy when you used to take her out on dates?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven nodded, "Yeah! She was really happy. She loves street food."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Diana was happy, she was like a child, and it made him happy too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Luna standing not far away, Evan lowered his voice and asked, "Mr. Gellar, have you and Mrs. Gellar... been intimate?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at him, confused.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What do you mean?" Steven asked in a low voice.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan felt a bit exhausted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Does he really not get it?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He seriously doubted if Steven was even a man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Married life," Evan said through gritted teeth. His face flushed with embarrassment. The past two nights with Luna had been pure bliss.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven blushed and shook his head slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan was speechless. "You've been married for three years, and you still haven't slept with her?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven frowned but stayed silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, he glanced at Luna in the distance, then back at Evan. In a low voice, he asked, "Did you sleep with Luna?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1129.html">« Prev</a><a href="1131.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
