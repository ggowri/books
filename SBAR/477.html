He thought, "Diana had like a man before. Is he the man who picked her up at the hospital that night? But why did she divorce?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man sat in the car that night, and Joseph couldn't see the man's appearance clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph lowered his head to eat and listened to Diana&nbsp;chatting with Tom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, it will take about three months for your hand to fully recover. The flesh in that area is broken. That bastard hit you so hard and wanted to kill you." Tom looked at Diana with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold glint of hatred flashed in Diana's eyes. "I won't let Samuel go. He provoked me first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom knew about her situation. "Is this bastard in collusion with Steven and Queenie?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded. "Yes, absolutely! Steven is willing to risk his life for Queenie. If Queenie cooperates with the Farley family, Steven may also help her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But there is no evidence now. I found out that Queenie had met Wyatt. As for Steven, he hasn't taken action yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When Queenie takes action, you might get caught in her trap again." Tom looked at Diana worriedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled helplessly, "Tom, can't you just have a little faith in me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom sighed, "We warned you before. The Marsh and Gellar families were trouble from the start. But you insisted on going back to your so-called family, and look where that got you. Every time I see you, I want to beat you up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled and quickly changed the subject, "This oatmeal tastes good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom said, "I got my chef to make it. Diana, once you're better, come over to my place with Joseph. I'll have the chef whip up a feast for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at Joseph. "Joseph, remember this. Once I'm out of the hospital, we're heading to Tom's for dinner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her bright smile, Joseph smiled as well and said, "Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom shook his head and smiled, "You have my words. By the way, Tobias will be back soon. When will Julius come back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Julius owes me a meal. My family has another project that requires cooperation with him. I'm just waiting for him to come back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana </span><span>replied</span><span>, "Julius will come back before my birthday. Take it easy.&nbsp;You can come to him for cooperation when he comes back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure. I've been busy recently. Many patients are waiting for me to perform surgery." Tom was a good doctor who truly cared about his patients.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was kind-hearted with everyone he treated. That's why he got into medicine in the first place</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had entrusted the hospital to Tom because he was the perfect person to lead it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph still refused to leave after dinner. Diana smiled, "Joseph, I'll be back soon, and I can bandage the wound myself at home. Priya will be discharged in a few days. Have you found a place to </span><span>stay</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana remembered that Joseph seemed to have sold his house to save Priya.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph said, "Diana, you gave me a lot of money. I can just rent a house."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought for a moment and then said, "I'll send you a password. I have an apartment in Maple Residence, which locates next to the university you attend. You can move in with Priya&zwnj; first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can feel more at ease. I have a lot of properties, and I don't like to rent them out. Just accept it. Anyway, it's unoccupied. The environment there is good, and the apartment is big. It is good for Priya&zwnj;'s health."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since it concerned Priya's health, Joseph couldn't refuse. He planned to repay Diana someday. "Thank you, Diana," he said gratefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled. That was all she could do for Joseph.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="476.html">« Prev</a><a href="478.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
