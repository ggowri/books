We're close to Luna's location. Don't worry, I'll bring her back."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright! Make sure Luna is safe," Diana urged as she hung up. She looked ahead and saw that traffic was at a standstill, which made her anxious.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her grip tightened on the steering wheel.&nbsp;Why the sudden traffic jam?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was growing increasingly agitated, and the honking from behind only made her more irritable.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was also watching the road ahead. "Diana, don't worry. There are often dump trucks on this road. It's likely there was an accident," he said.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was anxious, but her car was stuck in the middle and couldn't move. She ignored Steven.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her only hope was now with Nolan.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Luna must be safe," Diana thought. Suddenly, an idea struck her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She opened the computer in the car. If Luna had managed to capture the evidence, she would have uploaded it to the cloud.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If discovered, Luna could delete it directly without putting herself in danger.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana located the date of the file and clicked on it. There really was a file.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She opened it and found a video showing a male waiter approaching Cecil. While Cecil was chatting, the waiter dropped a pill into his drink.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A friend came over for a toast, and Cecil, unsuspecting, raised his glass and drank it all in one go.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, a figure with a similar silhouette to Diana walked by. Cecil stood up and followed. "Diana, wait for me. I don't feel well. Could you check on me?" he said.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It only took a few seconds to get upstairs from that spot.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While climbing the stairs, Cecil's condition worsened. As he pushed open the door, Steven, Jace, and others arrived, followed by Queenie's ear-splitting scream.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, that's how it was. Queenie's scheme was indeed cunning.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana glanced at Steven, unsure of his intentions.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Gellar, bringing so many people for a setup like this. You're impressive. Are you after the Farley family, too?" Diana asked bluntly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven looked at her inscrutably. He knew that no matter how he explained, she wouldn't believe him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, the Farley family are wealthy, and their stock value is high. As a businessman, of course, I want it," Steven replied.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana sent the video to Rita and said firmly, "But I won't let you and Queenie get what you want."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, I'm curious to see your strength," Steven said, not offering further explanation. He knew that his past actions had indeed wronged her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana didn't respond. Strangely, she didn't feel like saying anything to him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rita quickly replied.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Diana, thank you so much. I sent someone to check the surveillance room, but the footage had already been destroyed.]</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana: [Grandma, Luna recorded the footage, but she might have been taken by Mr. Foliot's people. I'm on my way to find her. Be careful around him.]</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rita: [Diana, he's just an old lecherous fool. I don't take him seriously.]</p><div class="pagination"><a href="338.html">« Prev</a><a href="340.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
