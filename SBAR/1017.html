She paused for a moment, then lowered her gaze, finally taking a bite of the lollipop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sweet, creamy taste hit her instantly. It was so good&mdash;almost like a flashback to her childhood when she used to devour candy without a second thought. That was until the pain of cavities stopped her cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could still remember how her grandfather would hold her close when she cried, softly murmuring, "Diana, no more candy. It's bad for your teeth. Don't worry, sweetheart, tomorrow we'll go to the dentist. You'll feel better after the shot and some medicine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the toothache had been unbearable, making her feel like she was being torn apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, her grandfather always treated her with such tenderness. Even now, the warmth of his love still lingered in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd made a vow&mdash;she wouldn't repeat the same mistakes. She wouldn't cause her grandfather that kind of pain again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A small smile appeared on her face, though her eyes betrayed a flicker of sorrow. Still, she chirped, "It's really sweet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil grinned. "That's the point, Diana. I'm off now. I'll see you tonight. Don't work too hard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana waved him off, smiling brightly, "Bye."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil chuckled and walked toward the door, pausing at the threshold to glance back at her one last time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Steven, observing through the security feed, narrowed his eyes. No Alexander, now it was Joseph and Cecil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Diana so animated, he couldn't help but wonder&mdash;was she so happy because Cecil was her age, or was there something more?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He and Diana had never shared such a carefree, light-hearted conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's anger surged, but after a beat, he scoffed at himself. What right did he have to be angry? He had pushed her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had tried so hard to get close to him, but his cold demeanor had shut her down completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, no matter what he did, it was all meaningless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was free now. She could laugh and chat with anyone she wanted. And she seemed truly happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why had he ever pushed her away in the first place? She was amazing. Now, she was someone else's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven ran a hand through his hair, frustration gnawing at him. He still hadn't gotten any concrete info on the Mysterium Organization. Until Andrew returned, he couldn't make any progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Andrew wouldn't give up easily. That fortune had been the focus of his life's work. He wasn't about to let it slip through his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eyes hardened. He wouldn't let it go without a fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shifted his gaze and met Evan's curious stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's with the look?" Steven asked, his voice low and hoarse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan rested his chin in his hands, a smirk forming. "Mr. Galler, you look pretty cute when you're jealous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's expression darkened. Was he really jealous?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't respond, but a heavy sadness weighed on his chest. He remembered the days when Diana used to smile at him so brightly, and he hadn't cherished those moments. Now it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't care about him anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew he wasn't dead, but still, she was indifferent. She had moved on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remembered when he was broken, no one cared about him. The only one who stuck by his side was Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recalled the days when she'd sit beside him, reading financial news aloud to him&mdash;her voice so clear, so soothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had felt like the world was at peace for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But those days were long gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, how's the investigation into Mysterium going?" Steven finally asked, trying to refocus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan braced himself, knowing the question would come. The answer wasn't good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Galler, I've tracked their operations to an isolated island. We should have more details soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had taken a monumental effort to track down their base, but he'd managed to pinpoint it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The island was an experimental base, and attacking it head-on wasn't an option.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan feared they wouldn't even make it to the island before being taken out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they got to the bottom of this, they'd have to think long and hard about the next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Galler, there's something bigger going on here. This conspiracy goes way back&mdash;over 30 years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's behind all of this? Who's been pulling the strings?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your mother, your biological father&mdash;doesn't it all seem off?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan actually wanted to ask, "Mr. Gellar, do you know who your real father is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But looking at the situation he was in, he hesitated. For some reason, the words just wouldn't come out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven didn't know, but he was certain his grandfather did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned toward the window, murmuring softly, "Spring's here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan blinked, clearly confused. "What? What are you talking about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Galler, are you missing your woman?" Evan ventured, trying to make sense of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's brow furrowed in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's that supposed to mean?" he asked, his voice tight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan gestured toward the window. "When a man says 'spring's here', doesn't that usually mean... well, he's feeling frisky?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's face flushed again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell are you talking about?" Steven's voice was edged with irritation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind wandered, briefly trapped in the memory of a particular night. He could almost feel her softness, the way she fit so perfectly in his arms, her scent&mdash;fresh and intoxicating&mdash;still clung to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just thinking about it made his heart race, his face flushing with heat. His entire body was alive with a sudden intensity he couldn't shake off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze shifted back to the screen, where Diana appeared, casually sucking on a lollipop. The way her cheek puffed out as she playfully chewed on it made her look impossibly cute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That stunning beauty of hers&mdash;how had he ever held back? How had he managed to resist?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan's eyes twinkled, noticing the way Steven was looking at Diana. "Mr. Galler, don't tell me... nothing happened between you two?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's gaze sharpened, his voice laced with warning. "You talk too much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan fell silent but couldn't help but let out a teasing "Oh".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven ignored him, his attention fixed back on Diana's image. He was also checking his emails from time to time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he wasn't by Diana's side or physically present at the company, he was aware of everything&mdash;every move within the office, everything happening around Diana, and every development concerning Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan, frustrated with the lack of conversation, found himself longing for the office&mdash;at least there he had others to talk to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahh..." he sighed, irritated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to check on Luna too. Hiding away in his room, he worked while keeping an eye on her. But that guy&mdash;Nick&mdash;why was he always around her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan's frustration grew. If he didn't get back soon, his "wife" might just leave him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, he returned to work, checking in with overseas contacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had worked hard all day, and by the afternoon, Cecil came to escort her to a banquet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie, busy at the office, couldn't afford to grieve her parents' issues. But when she received the invitation from Cecil, she knew he had something up his sleeve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil had been patient up until now, but she was curious&mdash;what was his real agenda?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was this all just to humiliate her? Or was there a deeper plot in motion?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1016.html">« Prev</a><a href="1018.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
