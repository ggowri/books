Her eyes reddened. She thought, "I must have met a savior.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That's great. My grandson has hope now."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Priya&zwnj; said, "Girl, Joseph is filial. But I have no ability. He suffered so much at such a young age, and he almost couldn't go to college.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't have any other wishes. I just hope that Joseph can finish college and find a good job. Then, I will die at ease.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry. When Joseph gets a job, he will pay you back the money for his schooling."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana knew that it was the expectation of all parents.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As long as you cooperate with the treatment, you will see Joseph's brilliant achievements in the future. As for Joseph's schooling, I will arrange it."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Priya&zwnj; was so excited that she burst into tears, holding Diana's hand and thanking her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana arranged for Priya&zwnj; to be transferred to another hospital at once.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna had only strained her arm. It was no big deal, so she just needed to go home and rest.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana and Luna went to the hospital together. Diana's senior, Tom Cullen, was at the hospital. Diana arranged a ward for Priya&zwnj;.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, Diana took Joseph to find Tom.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tom, this is the medical record of Joseph's grandmother. Now that you are back, you can help with this operation. It is a minimally invasive surgery. You have learned the most authoritative technology abroad."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tom picked it up and looked at it carefully. He frowned, "The shadow is quite large. But it can be treated with minimally invasive surgery. I will give Priya&zwnj; another full-body check-up tomorrow. But you have to help me get a position in your hospital."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was waiting for him to say this. "Then be the dean. I asked you to come back before because I wanted you to be the dean.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll immediately ask the Human Resources Department to issue an order. I will be very busy in the next two years and will not be able to manage the hospital. I feel relieved to have you here."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana knew that Tom was a rare good doctor. As they were family, Diana, of course, would keep him at her hospital.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tom laughed so happily. He thought, "My life is really awesome.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I become the dean in no time. I don't have to wait until I am bald."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's great, Diana. You're so good to me. Let's have a hug." Tom excitedly hugged Diana and spun around.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph watched from the side, feeling uncomfortable. He looked at Tom's hand with a gloomy look.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tom, put me down now. I feel dizzy."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shouted quickly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tom then put her down and looked at her with an apologetic smile. "Sorry, Diana. I'm just too happy."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled, "Tom, this is Joseph. Add his phone number. You can communicate about his grandmother."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tom said, "Okay!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, Tom took a look at Joseph and was shocked by his handsome face.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "No wonder Diana wants to help him. It's the type of beauty she likes. But why does he look at me like an enemy?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tom looked at Diana with a meaningful expression.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana held her forehead with his hand. She thought, "Tom is overthinking."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She watched the two add their phone numbers. She looked at Joseph and said, "Joseph, go back to the ward first. I will discuss your grandmother's condition with Tom. There are two rooms in the ward. It is reserved for your grandmother. You can cook here. You can come here to take care of your grandmother at any time. But you are not allowed to use open flames."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph smiled gratefully, "Thank you!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, he asked cautiously, "Can I add your phone number?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph finished speaking and blushed. He was handsome. But under Diana's gaze, he felt a sense of inferiority.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course. I will arrange for you to study when your grandma has almost recovered from the surgery."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana then gave him her phone number.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph went back to take care of Priya&zwnj;. But when he reached the corner, he suddenly remembered that he had not asked her name yet. He turned around and heard Tom's voice.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, it seems like it is the first time you two have met each other. Why are you helping a stranger?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="343.html">« Prev</a><a href="345.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
