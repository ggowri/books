Do you want to wait here? If so, I can make you some coffee."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie frowned, eyeing Diana's spacious office.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nolan was too good to her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't fair. She had driven Diana out, yet Diana was thriving, even more radiant than when she was with Steven.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Seems like an easy job, this designer gig. Who's she out having fun with?" She said.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna, sensing the spite in her words, retorted, "What do you want to hear? That she's out with some guy?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her reaction took Queenie aback.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's with the attitude? Who do you think you're talking to?" Queenie's face darkened, irked by the assistant's sass.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna smirked, "My attitude? Listen, Diana won't be in for days. You can see yourself out."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is this how you treat guests?" Queenie glared at Luna, her haughty expression grating on Luna's nerves.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now that she was here, Queenie figured she might as well stir up some trouble before leaving.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With Diana out, it was the perfect chance to snoop around and set her up.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna, catching on, flashed a sly look. "Please, have a seat. I'll fetch you some coffee."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna left, then discreetly started a livestream.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana had mentioned facing a lot of grief lately. She had told Luna that if Queenie came snooping, going live was the way to go. Queenie constantly stirred up trouble when it came to her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana had been trashed online recently. Today, it'd be Queenie's turn to face the music.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was only fair - tit for tat.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as Luna was gone, Queenie's mask slipped, revealing her true colors.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh Diana, Diana. I kicked you out, yet here you are in this cushy office. You'd be better off as a couch potato at home. I won't let you steal my spotlight."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie started rummaging through Diana's desk.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll make you out to be a thief, Diana. A copycat who steals others' work. I'll destroy your reputation."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Queenie's twisted expression was on full display for the camera.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Inside the livestream...</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Holy crap, is that Queenie? She said she&rsquo;d ruin Diana&rsquo;s reputation. What a vicious snake.]</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[How can someone with such an awful character be in showbiz? Jace, we all respect you, but if you let someone like this act in movies, we'd rather not watch.]</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Boycott the Foliot family! Boycott Queenie!]</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie had no clue that netizens were watching her every move, glued to the drama unfolding. She was busy rummaging through Diana's desk.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Where are her manners? How could she go through someone else's desk? How's that any different from stealing?]</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Isn't her fiance Steven? You'd think she'd be afraid to act out. Guess not!]</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Hah! It looks like even Capitole's golden boy got fooled this time. Queenie's just disgusting.]</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie found a few discarded design sketches of Diana's and snapped some photos.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, these photos could destroy your reputation. I'm going to make sure you can't show your face at Capitole ever again."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Gellar Group...</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan rushed into the office, out of breath.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Gellar! Queenie went to Ms. Bishop's office to steal design sketches, and the whole thing was live-streamed online. Not only that, but the things she said were absolutely outrageous. I think Queenie's career will be toast before the movie even starts filming."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven hadn't slept well last night. He rubbed his temples, trying to ease his headache.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then he watched the video Evan had brought him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he watched, a cold fury flashed in his eyes. "I let her sweet and gentle act fool me before. Never again."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="317.html">« Prev</a><a href="319.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
