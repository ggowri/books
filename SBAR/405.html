"I really didn't choose wrong; this place is truly beautiful."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige and Cecil were also very excited. Although Cecil is a young master who usually only knows how to enjoy himself, he had never personally experienced the joy of self-sufficiency before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was very excited now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana changed into her diving suit on the boat. The black diving suit made her figure appear even slimmer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was holding a fishing net and a three-meter-long spear gun.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil walked over and said, "Diana, you can't swim, why don't I go down with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana put on her glasses and looked at him, saying, "Mr. Farley, this is no joke; don't cause trouble, it's dangerous. You and Paige can fish here, and I'll go down to catch some groupers and lobsters for you. Since you even brought a chef, dinner will surely be delicious."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying this, Diana jumped into the sea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil admired Diana as she swam freely like a mermaid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige put on her sun protection clothing and looked at Cecil, saying, "Go and bring down all the fishing gear. I'm determined to catch a red snapper or a grouper today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil suddenly pointed at a boat not far away and said, "Paige, look."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige looked over and saw Steven standing at the bow of the boat, wearing a white shirt and black casual pants, with sunglasses on. He exuded an indescribable elegance and a commanding presence that made him look as handsome as a painting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wow, Steven really looks handsome when he's not wearing a suit," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil's face darkened as he said, "That guy who won't leave us alone. What's he doing here? Acting cool isn't hard; I'm also very handsome."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only then did Paige remember that Steven was a scumbag who hurt Diana's feelings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She also puffed up with anger, putting her hands on her hips and said, "He must be here to cause trouble."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, looking at Cecil in his oversized shorts, she said, "You lose. Your face is still decent, but considering this outfit of yours, you really lose."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana made the right choice to leave Steven. Behind closed doors, everyone is saying that Steven is cold and heartless, prioritizing interests above all else, and is the most ruthless leader in the Gellar family," she said.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="404.html">« Prev</a><a href="406.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
