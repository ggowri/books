She had never thought Jeff would be so shameless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was shameless to the extreme!</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the years, Paula had always felt Jeff's gentleness and consideration for her were genuine. But she finally realized his cruelty today.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula was full of disdain. "Jeff, you have treated Queenie as a treasure since she was a child. You gave all your love to her, ignored my four sons, and even stole my biological daughter and threw her into the countryside. Now, you tell me that Queenie is ungrateful. You are really ironic."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff felt uncomfortable. It was apparent that divorce was what he wanted most, and living happily together as a family of four was also what he wanted most.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't understand why his outcome became nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff still liked Paula and liked her gentleness and kindness.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only after Paula left did he realize who was the best for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff thought, "If I hadn't done those things, I would still have a warm and happy family now. My parents wouldn't be bothering me all the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have done all of this by myself. Now, I regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was standing not far away and saw this scene. She also felt that Jeff was too shameless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never had a good impression of Jeff, her father. From the first time they met, she felt that Jeff was not her father.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This feeling had always been strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was not feeling well today as he had a cold. He thought, "If Paula is by my side and sees me having a runny nose, she will put aside her work at the company and take care of me at home until I recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie is not as attentive as Paula. Amelie only cares about herself and doesn't care about me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sincerely apologized, "Paula, I was wrong. We are both old now. Let's live a good life after we remarry. I know you will find a way to pay back the 500 million dollars. I believe in your ability."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula's eyes were calm, and her voice was very indifferent. "You and I divorced a long time ago. There is no relationship between us. Don't forget that it was your family who forced me to divorce. You abandoned me when I was in the most difficult time. Do you still expect me to care about you like before?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jeff, how dare you come to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula's eyes were contemptuous and cold, making Jeff shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paula, I was wrong. I was really wrong..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula interrupted him and smiled, "Jeff, you were not wrong. I was blind. You met me when you were 20 years old. When you were 22, I gave birth to Gale. In the next five years, I was pregnant and had children because I felt that you loved me and that you were a good person. I am the only daughter in our family. I often feel lonely. I think having more children will make our family lively. When you stopped me from having children, I didn't suspect that you had other women.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Marsh family lives a good life because of the Barnes family. Now, I have no money to give them. After they suck all your blood, they will kick you away.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The woman you think loves you has actually been cuckolding you. The daughter you feel you raised carefully and brilliantly is ungrateful.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jeff, spend the rest of your life rotting to death with them."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was shocked. His legs went weak, and his face turned pale. Paula explained his current situation clearly to him in just a few words. He really regretted it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had not agreed to Queenie's idea, nothing would have happened to Paula's company, and he would still be living a happy life.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paula..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula turned to leave. But she saw Diana standing not far behind her.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="683.html">« Prev</a><a href="685.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
