She felt utterly wretched. "I should have known better. You'd seek revenge on me for the slightest scratch on Queenie, let alone her fainting. I'm just unlucky to be caught between you two crazy people."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without even glancing at Steven, Diana muttered to herself, turned, packed her suitcase, and headed for the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven blocked her path. "Where are you going at this hour?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shoved him aside. "None of your business. I won't let you bully me anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes burned with a deep-seated loathing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was at a loss. "Diana, why won't you believe me? You're wrong about what happened tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wrong about you? Steven, I saw it with my own eyes. You claim I'm wrong, but why were you here? It's too much of a coincidence that you just happened to be at my door, isn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana trembled with pain. She clenched her fists tightly, like a little lion out of control.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven felt a profound sorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, seeing her in distress only fueled his anger. He was perplexed, questioning why Diana, his wife, would choose to make things difficult for Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had been wrong. Diana hadn't fought or competed; Queenie had provoked her at every turn. They had witnessed Diana's angriest moments and misunderstood her entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll prove to you that tonight had nothing to do with me. As for Queenie, her life or death means nothing to me now. I'll help you reclaim what she's taken from you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first time Diana had heard Steven defend her like this, but she didn't believe he would help her against Queenie. "Save that for yourself. I won't take it seriously."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She left with the suitcase.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven watched her go, sensing that her departure would seal the misunderstanding between them forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He strode after her, taking her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She struggled fiercely. "Let me go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven whispered, "Come with me. I don't want you to misunderstand me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana refused to go. Mimicking Steven's tone, she retorted, "Why should I listen to your explanation, Steven? I only believe what I see."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was stunned, staring at her intently. He had said those words to Diana countless times.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holding onto Diana, he wouldn't let her leave. He instructed the bodyguards, "Drag those two men to the opposite room and beat them until they reveal the mastermind behind this."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These bodyguards were all summoned by Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four bodyguards moved swiftly, lifting the men and dragging them to a nearby fire escape, where there was a lounge.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven pulled Diana along.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sneered, "Steven, stop the act. Now that I've seen through you, are you going to use your tricks on me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven felt her intelligence was momentarily offline. "Diana, if they were my men, I'd watch from the sidelines. These people weren't sent by me. I was at fault for letting the bodyguard hurt you before. I believed Queenie's lies back then."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven felt a pang of discomfort every time he thought about it. He didn't want to admit that he, a proud man, had been deceived by Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up, and don't you dare bring up the past," Diana snapped. As she struggled to escape, she managed to say, "Do you think admitting you were wrong can just erase all the harm you've inflicted on me?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="773.html">« Prev</a><a href="775.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
