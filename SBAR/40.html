She took a quick step back and unexpectedly bumped into a warm embrace.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, be careful!" a deep voice said, its richness like a fine wine that becomes more flavorful over time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of his breathing drew closer, causing Diana to momentarily tense up. She looked up into Alexander's handsome face, her smiling eyes meeting his concerned and deep ones. "Mr. Powell, I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes twinkled with amusement as he looked into her bright and shrewd eyes. "Diana, you've wounded me&mdash;especially my heart. Your sudden arrival here has left it aching," he teased.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana blinked, feeling as if Alexander was flirting with her. She thought, "Oh! This is Mr. Powell! Is he really flirting with me? Mr. Powell, you're crossing the line!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven watched the two of them with a somber expression as they exchanged affectionate glances. Anger welled up inside him, his eyes blazing with fury. "Diana, you should remember who you are," he warned in a low voice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie, meanwhile, was seething with jealousy, thinking, "How does Diana even know Alexander?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's demeanor turned serious as he met Steven's gaze. It was as if they had clashed a hundred times before. "Mr. Gellar, mind your own business. Diana is my companion tonight."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eyes were filled with a storm of anger as he looked at Diana. "Do you have a problem with that?" Diana asked defiantly. She wasn't going to let him intimidate her anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She used to tolerate his behavior because she loved him. Now that she no longer did, he was no more important than the grass on the roadside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at Steven deeply, then turned to Diana and gently explained, "Diana, I'm sorry I was delayed earlier and couldn't come to pick you up."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head, smiling softly. "It's okay. I ran into an old acquaintance and stopped to say hello."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Luna. "Luna, go enjoy yourself. Find something to eat, and we'll leave at ten sharp."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna nodded, intending to stay close and protect Diana discreetly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go, Diana. I'll introduce you to Mr. James," Alexander said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay!" Diana replied with a smile, following Alexander away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven overheard Henry's name. He also planned to speak with Henry tonight about a potential collaboration. However, Steven only knew Avernia's native language, and his interpreter was hospitalized due to acclimatization issues.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't speak Avernia's language fluently, so he had brought Queenie along. She had lived in Avernia for two years and could help with the translation. They hadn't expected to encounter Diana here.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, let's go over there and take a look," Steven suggested.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smiled gently. "Don't worry, Steven. I'll help you secure the partnership."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Queenie succeeded in securing this deal, Steven would have to marry her. The thought of her future happiness made her smile uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff stayed behind to greet familiar partners. The event was bustling with guests, all talking, laughing, and mingling. Food and wine were abundant, and Diana couldn't resist the delicious offerings as she passed by.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She resembled a little cat drawn to the treats, which amused Alexander. He greeted people around him with grace and charm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven couldn't take his eyes off Diana, who looked as lively and enchanting as an elf.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The main hall was reserved for distinguished guests, and it was opulently decorated. An elderly man from Avernia, with elegant gray hair, sat there. He was seventy years old but still active in his company.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was there to discuss a car parts partnership with Alexander.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Queenie saw Henry, she quickly approached him and greeted him respectfully in Avernia's language, "Mr. James, hello, I'm Queenie Marsh. Nice to meet you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry looked at Queenie, puzzled, with his azure eyes. He responded in Avernia's language, "What language were you speaking?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="39.html">« Prev</a><a href="41.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
