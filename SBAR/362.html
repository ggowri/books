Once Steven takes over the family, he'll marry you. I won't let Diana steal him away from you," Frank said, his heart breaking for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Queenie remained unmoved. In her eyes, it was because of Frank and his brothers that she had become an illegitimate daughter. She hated them, but she couldn't deny that it was through Paula that her biological mother had been able to live a comfortable life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The desire to dominate Capitole burned within Queenie, fueling her hatred with every clash with Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her own company had been thriving, and with some secrets she had obtained from Jace's company, it would only continue to grow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Over the years, thanks to Steven, Queenie had learned the allure of power and influence. Once she had tasted the sweetness of wealth, she couldn't bear to let it slip away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had absorbed many business techniques from Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nevertheless, she was well masking her ambitions and scheming nature. "Thank you, Frank! Let's return. Diana slapped me today, and my face is really hurting," Queenie said, feigning distress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at her red and swollen cheek, Frank reassured her, "Diana is too cruel. But don't worry. I will teach her a lesson when I see her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie found some relief in his words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Come on, Frank. Let's go home. Your wedding is in a few days. We should try to persuade Mom to attend," Queenie said, pretending to be concerned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank felt sad. It hurt not to have his mother's blessing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instead of responding to her words, he said, "I'll drop you off."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie sensed that there was something amiss with his manners, but being in a sour mood, she didn't dwell on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Frank drove Queenie to Marsh Villa, he didn't go inside because Paula hadn't returned yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at the house that had been his home for over 20 years and thinking of his grandparents' presence, he no longer wanted to go back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His grandparents were materialistic, and he despised them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for Paula, he pondered and realized that everyone loved their children, and he expected her to attend his wedding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, he couldn't shake the feeling of disappointment at the thought of Paula not wanting him because of the company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It became clear to him that Paula didn't love him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was so angry that he phoned Paula.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hello!" Paula answered, sounding tired.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, it's me," Frank said nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I know it's you. What's the matter? I'm busy picking out dresses for Queenie. Spit it out," Paula replied, her tone tinged with annoyance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank smiled bitterly. "Mom, is my wedding not as important as Queenie's dress?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula's words struck a chord with him. He remembered a time when he had taken Queenie shopping and had bumped into Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana greeted him, while he yelled at her, telling her to hurry up and not to disturb him while he chose a gift for Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The more he thought about it, the more Frank realized how harshly he had treated his own sister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, why are you choosing a dress for Queenie?" Frank asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula explained, "She's a star and has many parties to attend. So I have to buy some dresses for her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was a little amused. "Mom, I'm getting married. Aren't you coming?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula responded, "Is your wedding more important than Queenie? I warned you not to marry that kind of woman, but you went against me. From now on, I no longer have a son like you. I only have Queenie. And of course, I'll be leaving the company to her. That's all. Bye."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tears streamed down Paula's face as she sat in her office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had treated Frank the way he had treated Diana, intending to make him feel this pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie wanted to be superior. Fine, she would help her, and when her mother's identity as a mistress was revealed, Paula would ensure that she lost everything she once had.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Those who had bullied Diana would pay the price.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's heart had been shattered, and it would probably never be whole again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The greatest regret of Paula's life was her lack of trust in Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Overwhelmed by sadness, Paula glanced at the dark clouds gathering outside. Rain was imminent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today, she completed another part of her plan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wait for it, Diana. I will definitely avenge you," Paula whispered to herself.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="361.html">« Prev</a><a href="363.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
