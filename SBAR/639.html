"Jeff, why are you hiding there? While chasing after me, you never told me that you had a wife. I only knew that you were penniless. Unexpectedly, you lied to me and brought the daughter you had with this woman to live with me. Moreover, you threw my biological daughter away. Jeff, Diana is also your daughter. How could you be so cruel to her?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are a real bastard."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula took the initiative, and her voice was loud.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, legally, she and Jeff had been husband and wife for more than twenty years, and most people in Capitole were aware of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was the immoral mistress.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff, who was named, was so embarrassed that he wanted to get out of here right away. It was all his fault anyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie put all the blame on him. He sneered. It turned out that they were the same kind of people.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paula, it's my fault. I shouldn't have gotten involved with her and married you. It is all my fault. At that time, I didn't know she was pregnant with my child."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was stunned. What an idiot!</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie gazed at Jeff in shock as he pretended to be innocent. He was really unreliable.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula insisted on seeking justice for Diana today. She roared, "Jeff, why did you throw away my daughter? What right did you have to do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff glared at Amelie with resentment. It was she who had caused trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was such a shameless mistress that she was eager to expose their affair.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn't it good for their family of four to live a peaceful life now? Why did she make a scene?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a fool.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff said, "Paula, I'm sorry for abandoning Diana. I was stupid then. However, she came back safe and sound later, didn't she?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Diana came back safe and sound, but you, the shameless father and daughter, ruined our mother-daughter relationship. You schemed against Diana and finally framed her to clear your name. In fact, you are the hateful culprits.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jeff, you really are the most annoying bastard," Paula screamed in agony and collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, Paula, calm down. You were unstable before. I know you can't stand the stimulation and that you have mental problems, but please control yourself in a crowded place. As for what happened between me and Diana, I was just born at the time and had no choice. My father just switched me with Diana on an impulse.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone makes mistakes. My father was just being stupid for a moment," Queenie explained aggrievedly. She would never allow Paula to be sympathized with. Otherwise, all public opinion would be biased toward Paula.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she would be reduced to bitter denunciations.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie tried to prove that Paula was mentally ill.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula was dumbfounded. She really underestimated Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was extremely brazen.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, I raised you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie quickly interrupted her, "Yes. I admit that you raised me. I regard you as my mother, so I have never dared to tell anyone about your mental problems. As a result of your illness, you failed to manage the company properly, which led to its bankruptcy. It is our fault for not discovering your condition earlier."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="638.html">« Prev</a><a href="640.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
