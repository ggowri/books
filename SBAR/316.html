Queenie fumed. "Just fuck off! I'll wait for Steven."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan took off without another word.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once outside the villa gates, he called Steven.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hello?" Steven's voice was low, and Evan knew he hadn't caught up with Diana.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Gellar, Ms. Marsh is at your doorstep refusing to leave. She insists on waiting for you."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If she wants to wait, let her wait," Steven said. "I'm going to the office."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven hung up without another word.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan chuckled as he ended the call. Steven, now, was nothing more than a rich jerk.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he was in love, he could pamper Queenie like a princess, but when he wasn't, he'd discard her like trash.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan turned back and glanced at Queenie squatting by the door. Well, let her keep squatting, then. At this moment, he really couldn't tell who was more pathetic.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie waited for an hour, but Steven didn't show up. Furious, she called him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven claimed he was working late at the office and told her to go home.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She asked for the door code, but Steven said it was his house now, and she wasn't allowed in.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was livid, but she had no choice but to leave.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was working like a madman. Her chance was gone for tonight.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie stumbled out of the mansion, looking rather disheveled. She gazed at the luxurious gated community - once her dream home.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Standing by the curb, she pulled out her phone and dialed Steven's father, Andrew.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie." Andrew's voice was gentle.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's tone was pitiful. "Sir, I think we need you to step in this time. Steven won't divorce Diana. If we don't push him, our plan's going to fall apart."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew's voice was low and husky. "I understand, Queenie. Don't worry, I'll be back tomorrow."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing this, Queenie perked up. "Thank you!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If he's willing to invest in you, it means he still has feelings for you. Make sure you've got him wrapped around your finger, you know what I mean?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie got the message. Her voice turned silky. "Of course!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie thought about Diana's designs. That woman truly had a gift. She'd been holding back at the Marsh family.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Well, if that was how it was going to be, Diana couldn't blame her for playing dirty.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She'd send Diana straight to hell. Diana's very existence drove her crazy and made her fall apart. She didn't know why, but she hated Diana with a burning passion.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wouldn't rest until Diana was six feet under.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana made it home safely and immediately received a message from an unknown number.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Diana, I wish you dead.]</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana jumped, startled. "Who is this?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She ignored it and grabbed her clothes to shower.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After her shower hair dried, she picked up her phone to find a message from Steven.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Why didn't you come home tonight?]</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana rolled her eyes. He did know why!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When it came to divorce, Steven held all the cards. She was outmatched.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She couldn't compete with his wealth, and she didn't have the clout yet to challenge him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's only move was to bide her time. In two years, she'd file for divorce with photos of Steven and Queenie's affair.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lying on her bed, Diana reveled in the soft, white sheets, rolling around contentedly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This second chance at life couldn't be wasted. She knew Steven had cooled towards Queenie, but that woman's core was rotten to the bone. She was disgusting!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was greedy, wanting both money and fame. She wouldn't let either slip through her fingers.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In this life, just like her previous one, she navigated the circles of wealthy families.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Using her skills, she secured the partnerships she desired.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jace's situation caught her off guard.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil hadn't shared any updates about the Foliot family that afternoon.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana closed her eyes, trying to drift off to sleep. She'd already forgotten about Steven's message.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, in his office, Steven sat in his chair. Seeing his message left unanswered, he knew Diana wouldn't reply.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven watched as Evan walked in with a late-night snack.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan smiled, "Mr. Gellar, how about a bite to eat?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven grunted, "Sure."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stood up and asked, "Still no leads on that guy's whereabouts?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="315.html">« Prev</a><a href="317.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
