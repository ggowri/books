She was exhausted. Lying down, she closed her eyes to rest. The soft bed felt incredibly comfortable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven lay beside her, pulling her into his arms. In her sleep, Diana leaned closer to him. Feeling her trust, his gaze softened even more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said softly, "Silly girl, you still have feelings for me. You lean on me without even realizing it, smile at me. I'm so lucky to have met you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gently brushed his fingers over her delicate features, his eyes filled with love.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's skin was flawless, her features delicate, and even in sleep, she was breathtakingly beautiful. She was stunning, almost unreal. He felt a surge of happiness knowing she was his wife.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after, Steven fell asleep too. And once again, he had that dream.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the dream, everything was shrouded in darkness, the atmosphere cold and eerie. In the distance, beneath the faint outline of ornate beams in the shadows, there seemed to be the soft, crisp sound of bells swaying gently in the wind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Please, let my wife and child be reborn," the man said, his voice trembling. "This life, I</span><span>'</span><span>m willing to give up everything&mdash;my own life&mdash;for their return." Every word he spoke carried unbearable pain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The dream kept repeating itself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, there was a heavy thud. Steven looked down. In the icy snow, his wife had fallen from a tall building, crashing into the storm. Blood pooled beneath her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, Diana... Diana..." he murmured, tears welling in his eyes. His hands flailed desperately, and in his panic, he ended up waking Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, Steven, wake up. Did you have a nightmare?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's eyes snapped open. He stared at Diana silently, tears glistening in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana." He sat up abruptly, pulling her into his arms. "I'm sorry, Diana. I failed to protect you and the baby."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana, still groggy, looked at Steven, confused by his tears. "What's wrong? Did you have a nightmare?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven nodded slightly, his eyes serious as he looked at her. "Diana, are you okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "I'm fine, I just got punched awake by you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven let out a sigh of relief. Thank God, it was just a dream.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at his tearful eyes, puzzled. "What did you dream about that made you cry so much?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven lowered his gaze, looking so fragile. Diana couldn't help but reach out, wiping the tears off his face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't cry," Diana said softly, a hint of concern in her voice.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven murmured, "I dreamed you fell from upstairs. I was right there, watching you die in front of me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana froze for a moment, thinking. In her last life, when she died, did she see Steven? She couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t recall. All she remembered was the scene of her being taken away by her grandfather.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wondered, "Could it be that I had just died then, so I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t see Steven?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shivered. It was something strange that had happened to her, yet it still managed to scare her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled and said, "It</span><span>'</span><span>s just a dream, don</span><span>'</span><span>t overthink it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "But that</span><span>'</span><span>s something you actually went through. When you got mad at me and wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t let me mention having kids, I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t understand why you treated me like that. I just wanted to be with you, have a beautiful daughter, but you were so angry, yelling at me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now I understand why you were so angry back then. You were pregnant at the time, and George pushed you down the stairs. I can feel that pain now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "So, has time erased the things Steven did to hurt me? Am I falling for him again? This isn</span><span>'</span><span>t what I</span><span>'</span><span>m supposed to do."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana forced a smile, her emotions tangled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven watched her quietly, seeing the conflict in her eyes. His heart ached even more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He grabbed her shoulders tightly and pressed his lips to hers. Closing his eyes, tears streamed down uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was about to pull away, but when she tasted the salt of his tears, she stopped. Steven had cried several times these past few days.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's kiss, mixed with tears, left a bitter taste for Diana too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a long moment, Steven finally let go of Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They stared at each other in silence as Steven gently brushed his fingers over her slightly swollen lips.</span><span> </span><br><span>"Diana, thank you for being here with me. Thank you for showing me that life can still have meaning, that this world can be beautiful. Every day before you was nothing but pain."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why are you saying this all of a sudden?" Diana's voice trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was nothing like the melancholic boy she first met. But no matter which version of Steven, his life had always been filled with pain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I must be crazy to stick around, suffer with you, and still let you bully me," Diana said, rubbing her nose.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven laughed, tears in his eyes as he held her close.</span><span> </span><br><span>"Diana, in this world, apart from my grandparents, you're the only one who truly cares about me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't care about you," Diana said, lightly punching his chest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven caught her hand, holding it in his palm and playing with it.</span><span> </span><br><span>"Diana, your hands are beautiful," he said, smiling at her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana laughed too.</span><span> </span><br><span>"When you didn</span><span>'</span><span>t like me, you picked on everything about me. Now that you see my worth, suddenly I</span><span>'</span><span>m perfect. Do you even remember the things you used to say about me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven frowned.</span><span> </span><br><span>"Don't bring up the past. None of that was sincere," he said. "Haven't you noticed how peaceful and easy things are whenever Queenie isn't around?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t really noticed, but there was some truth to it.</span><span> </span><br><span>Yet, whenever Queenie came back, Steven stopped coming home. There were no chances for the two of them to be alone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She asked, "Steven, if you hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t met me, would you have married Queenie? I mean, you know her intentions, but you still see her as your savior."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven shook his head firmly.</span><span> </span><br><span>"I wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t!" he said with conviction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana didn</span><span>'</span><span>t believe him. She smiled and said,</span><span> </span><br><span>"Steven, you would. I saved you, but she took credit for it. To you, she</span><span>'</span><span>s also a light in the dark. You</span><span>'</span><span>d fall for her just the same."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t exposed her scheming side, she</span><span>'</span><span>d still be the sweet, kind, and perfect woman in your eyes."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana watched Steven</span><span>'</span><span>s increasingly tense expression, her smile growing wider.</span><span> </span><br><span>"Steven, I</span><span>'</span><span>m really curious," she said, her tone teasing. "Do men really fall in love with a woman just because she saved them?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1105.html">« Prev</a><a href="1107.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
