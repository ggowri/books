I hope you can keep your promise."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She went upstairs to pack up her belongings. She couldn't stay here any longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She joined the company in a high-profile manner but left with embarrassment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie stopped her and said, "Emma, I told you I could arrange a position for you. You can continue to be a designer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need." Emma smiled bitterly, "Queenie, I indeed have a crush on Steven, but giving up my dreams and future for him will only destroy my life. The deal is over. I'm leaving now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She stepped back indifferently and turned into the elevator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie gazed at her back with a frown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She mocked, "Emma, except for me and my company, no one wants you now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was waiting for Emma to beg her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her real purpose in this move was to make Diana utterly disappointed in the Marsh family and deeply resentful of Gale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It worked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Queenie was displeased that Diana got close to Steven again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She headed for the coffee shop across the street, where they were sitting face to face.&#8203;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's resistance to Steven was evident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stared at her. Noticing that she was not as angry as before, he said in a deep voice, "Diana, I had no idea that the design drawings were yours. A few days ago, Emma showed them to me. I was very satisfied, so I prepared to launch the new products.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It was my negligence. All the profits will be yours."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No. I have nothing to do with you. You don't have to give me all the profits. Just give me as much as I deserve. I won't ask for even a penny more. After all, you once said that I had no right to use your money, and I never used it..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, I said those in anger..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven couldn't continue speaking because he had really made those statements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm sorry. I didn't understand much about love at that time. Queenie saved my life and grew up with me. I trusted and doted on her completely, and she was always gentle and kind in front of me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's why I said those words."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's voice was low, and his regret was obvious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's heart couldn't help but ache.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She couldn't describe how she felt at that moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could their relationship of just a few years compare to their friendship since childhood?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven, when did Queenie save you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Last time, Diana wanted to ask this question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Queenie chipped in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven replied, "It was..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven, I brought you breakfast. Eat some now," Queenie suddenly interrupted him loudly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana gazed at her thoughtfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Could it be that Queenie took the credit for saving Steven from the fire?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That day, she was also nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The fire came out of nowhere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie opened the lunchbox and poured out the pumpkin soup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana knew at a glance that it was not tasty. Steven did not enjoy the pumpkin soup like this, and it was not a pleasant color.&#8203;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He fixed his cold eyes on Queenie. "Queenie, can't you see that I am discussing cooperation?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She smiled mischievously, "Steven, Diana and we are all family..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't flatter yourself. We are not family. Don't disgust me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the sight of Evan, Diana took the contract from him and scanned through it. After confirming that there was nothing wrong with it, she signed her name and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie stared at her back and chuckled, "Steven, Diana is becoming more and more elegant. Your father has been urging you to get a divorce. Steven, when are you going to complete the procedures?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="220.html">« Prev</a><a href="222.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
