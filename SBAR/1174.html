"Queenie, I cut ties with them long ago. Whatever you want to do with them is your business, but I'm still calling the police to report their kidnapping."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie let out a cold laugh, her voice dripping with venom that sent chills down one's spine. "Diana, remember that building where you died in your past life? We're right here. Your mother and two brothers are here too. I don't believe you won't come. You're such a soft-hearted fool despite your tough talk - so easy to manipulate. Remember, you only have one hour. If you dare call the police, you'll be next to die."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A chill ran down Diana's spine as Queenie hung up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn woman!" Diana sat on the bed, forcing herself to think clearly. Should she ignore this? Really just ignore it? Seven had told her that because of her, many people's fates had changed in this lifetime. What Paula had done belonged to the past life - in this one, she simply loved Queenie more. Could she really abandon them?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she still contacted Steven first, asking him to get help from his police friend.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was already at her door when he saw her call. He hung up and quickly pushed the door open, his voice low and gentle. "Diana, are you feeling unwell?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana spoke rapidly. "Steven, I need to trouble your police friend again today. Queenie's taken my mother and two brothers hostage, threatening me to come to the scene."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven frowned. He'd just gotten news about Queenie's whereabouts, and now Paula and the others had been captured. A bloodthirsty coldness flickered in his eyes. "Don't panic. I'll call my friend right now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "Okay! I'll go freshen up first. She only gave us an hour, but I'm still worried - I need to go check on them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was on the phone and couldn't respond immediately. After giving his friend the address, he went to find Diana in the bathroom. She had just finished tying up her hair and was rinsing her mouth. Steven stood nearby waiting, saying nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A few minutes later, Diana emerged from the bathroom. He took her hand and said, "Don't go. That place... you know what it means."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His tone was heavy, unable to voice what he really wanted to say - words he simply couldn't bring himself to speak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana met his dark, unfathomable gaze and smiled faintly. "Life and death - it all began there. I died in that place, and now I need to come back to life from there too. That place has always been a nightmare I didn't dare remember. If I face it head-on today, maybe my future won't have any more nightmares - only happiness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was courting death, and she wanted to see it through. As for Paula and her two brothers' lives - that would depend on their own luck.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stopped trying to dissuade her. This time, with him protecting her, nothing would happen to her. "Let's go. I'll come with you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If something happened to Paula and her sons, it would be a knot in Diana's heart that could never be untied. A birth mother was still a birth mother - she might say she didn't care, but deep down, her birth mother still mattered to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stood on her tiptoes and kissed his cheek. "Thank you, Steven."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled helplessly, then helped her change into comfortable clothes and found her a pair of very soft shoes before having Evan gather all the bodyguards to head to the abandoned building.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Inside the abandoned building, Paula, Eric, and Gale were all tied to concrete pillars.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie looked at the weakened Paula with complete mockery. "Paula, you schemed against me and I lost everything. Now I have nothing left. Even if I die, I'm dragging you all down with me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And there's Diana - the one you most want to love but will never get the chance to love again. I'll make her jump from here just like in the past life, ending up shattered to pieces, two lives lost as one."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula's pupils contracted sharply. "Queenie, what do you mean by that?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie's expression turned manic. "What do I mean? It's all because of Steven! All because of him! Why did we have to live this life over again?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie suddenly sneered at her. "Paula, do you know why Diana forgave Steven but won't forgive you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula knew exactly why. "Because we protected you in the past and hurt her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie shook her head with a cold laugh. "Wrong. You've got it all backwards. If Diana knew it was just a misunderstanding, she'd forgive you - she's stupid and kind-hearted like that. The real reason she won't forgive you... you'll understand soon enough. I'll make sure you die knowing the truth."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula's eyes widened. What did Queenie mean by that? Gale felt the same ominous dread creeping in.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie looked behind her - this was where it all began. If she could do it over again, she'd never make the same choices she did in this lifetime. This time, she was going to drag Diana down with her, die together, and be reborn together.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Forty minutes later.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana and Steven arrived at the scene. Police and bodyguards were all stationed downstairs on standby. Air cushions had been inflated below the abandoned building to ensure anyone who fell wouldn't die.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stared at the familiar skeletal structure looming before her - like some massive, rotting beast radiating death and decay. In her past life, she'd been trapped here for four days, dying in the most agonizing way possible. The memory made her whole body shake.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven knew this place was hell for her. He pulled Diana close, holding her tight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula couldn't believe Diana had actually come. Diana still cared about her after all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, what are you doing here? Get out of here now! Queenie's completely lost it - she's capable of anything. You need to leave!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*Slap!*</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie's hand cracked across Paula's face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Paula, none of you are walking away today. We're all jumping from here together and starting over."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula frowned at her. "Queenie, people can't come back from the dead. What are you talking about?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie suddenly pointed at Diana. "Oh really? Then let me tell you something - your daughter Diana came back from the dead. That's why I lost to her this time around."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?" Paula whipped around to stare at Diana, remembering what Diana had once told her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I had to die once to see how truly evil you people are."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula's whole body trembled. How was that possible? How could something like rebirth exist in this world?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana finally looked at Queenie, shocked by what she saw. Queenie looked like a completely different person from before - haggard and worn down. She wore baggy sweats that made her look even more pathetic. Without her designer clothes and perfect makeup, her face was drawn and pale, her skin dull, her eyes radiating pure malice. She was unrecognizable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana spoke slowly. "Queenie, let them go. This is between you and me. You want someone to blame? Come at me."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1173.html">« Prev</a><a href="1175.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
