"Diana, no matter how much you try to squirm, it doesn't change the fact that you're illiterate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After living together for nearly four years, I know you well. You're weak and incompetent. Let's be real. You can't even read a contract properly. How do you expect to manage a corporation?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone's watching, Diana. How much longer do you want to embarrass yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Queenie's words hung in the air, every pair of eyes in the room turned to Diana. Their expressions dripped with mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana met their gazes with a slight smile, one that seemed to emerge effortlessly, exuding a relaxed confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes sparkled with calm as if she were in complete control of the world around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, how well do you really know me to make such bold claims?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the crowd's derisive looks directed at Diana, Queenie felt</span><span> a surge of triumph. She thought she was halfway to her goal and intended to keep the pressure on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you've never worked a day in your life. You're just a housewife who revolves around men, a mistress who only knows how to seduce others."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned to Luna. "Luna."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna quickly stepped up to Queenie, and her expression was fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Queenie was about to question her intentions, a sharp slap echoed through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna's hand connected with Queenie's face, leaving her stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With fury in her eyes, Luna said, "Queenie, you're the daughter of esteemed Paula. How dare you speak so rudely? Do you think you can belittle our Ms. Bishop?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie stood there, dazed, taking in Luna's icy demeanor and the palpable anger in her gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mention of Paula shifted the atmosphere, and the crowd's perception of Queenie began to change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic flickered in Queenie's heart. This was the same Luna who had referred respectfully to Diana as "Ms. Bishop" during their first meeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Diana could speak the Raventia language fluently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sinking feeling settled in Queenie's stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that all these years, Diana has been hiding her true abilities? Have I been the foolish clown in front of her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I've done my homework. Diana's just a useless waste of space."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana watched as disbelief washed over Queenie's face while the others stared in shock at the unexpected turn of events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had never been this bold before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jace's fury erupted. "Diana, don't get too cocky! How dare you let someone hit Queenie? Just because you have a few tricks up your sleeve doesn't mean you can look down on others?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? Sir Foliot, are you feeling protective?" A teasing smile appeared on her face as Diana regarded Jace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jace's gaze locked onto Diana, and his mind raced. "Where does this girl get her audacity?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His unease grew as he tried to decipher her inscrutable expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not knowing what someone was truly thinking was the most dangerous game of all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jace retorted, "Queenie saved Novia. She's like family to me. If you bully her, you're bullying the Foliot family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tut, tut! Sir Foliot, you really are protective. I've never seen you defend your own kin this fiercely. Is she your family or... something else?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie quickly interjected, desperate to cut Diana off, "Diana, why go there? You have no ability to sit in that chair. Just step down and save yourself from further embarrassment. Paula is your mother. Do you really want to tarnish her name?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at her, taking in her anxious and flustered demeanor. It was almost satisfying. "Queenie, you took Paula's company, then turned around and pressured her into a divorce with your father. Now you all live a happy little life together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've severed ties with her long ago. She's always regarded you as her daughter, so what does that make me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If anyone's going to embarrass her, it's you&mdash;the daughter she raised for over twenty years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just look at you now, stirring up trouble at the company, trying to rally the shareholders to kick me out, all while you're nudging Sir Foliot to buy shares in the Gellar Group and make decisions for you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But let's be real. The Foliot family is barely holding it together. Ask Sir Foliot himself if he has the power to back you up. Maybe you should check the news before you start talking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, exuding a mix of defiance and an intriguing depth that drew people in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jace frowned at Diana's confident demeanor, which seemed almost ethereal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you're incredibly bold. Do you think you can just spin tales about the Foliot family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was thunderous. Jace, a man who had spent most of his life in power, was shocked that a mere girl would dare speak to him this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was the first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir Foliot, if you're going to keep threatening me, you might want to check your phone. Nathan's been up to some interesting business lately. He's currently at the police station."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana held up her phone, displaying the screen to Jace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He froze, quickly pulling out his own phone to see the headline blaring back at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[The Foliot Group General Manager Nathan Foliot Arrested for Domestic Violence Against Mistress, Victim in Critical Condition]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Accompanying it was a harrowing image of a woman with a torn face and bruises covering her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This news led to a decline in the stock price of the Foliot Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jace's eyes widened in horror as he looked back at Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, did you do this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't fathom that a girl like her could orchestrate such chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "Not me! But Queenie introduced that woman to Nathan. If you don't believe me, just ask Nathan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had a knack for "rescuing" desperate women, giving them a taste of hope before leading them to their doom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those women would often end up grateful to her, oblivious to the trap they were stepping into.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This particular woman had been placed in Jace's life by Queenie, who had then turned her sights on Nathan, Jace's eldest son, deeming him more appealing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But once the novelty wore off, Nathan wanted her gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman, greedy for more, resisted, and in a fit of rage, Nathan struck her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna's people had witnessed the scene and called the police just in time to save her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan was now in custody, and while Diana didn't know who leaked the news, she had stumbled upon it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jace's gaze shot to Queenie, realization dawning on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was caught off guard, and her mind raced. This turn of events was beyond her wildest expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head, feigning innocence. "Sir Foliot, that girl was just a college student I was helping. She said she wanted to break into showbiz, so I introduced her to Nathan. I had no idea what would happen afterward!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jace narrowed his eyes. He knew Nathan's temperament all too well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan had a history of domestic violence, but it had always been swept under the rug. Now, the truth was out, and he was furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pointed an accusatory finger at Diana, and his voice boomed with rage. "Diana, how dare you scheme against Nathan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn't help but laugh, and the smile on her face was both subtle and loaded with meaning. "Sir Foliot, do you really think I need to stoop to plotting against someone like Nathan? His own actions are enough."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="915.html">« Prev</a><a href="917.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
