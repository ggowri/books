His eyes were filled with loneliness and deep contemplation.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the middle of the night, Diana's phone began to vibrate continuously.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Woken up by the noise, she groggily wondered, "Who's calling me this late on such a cold night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was drowsy and unwilling to leave the warmth of her cozy bed, enjoying the winter comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the persistent ringing pulled her out of her slumber. Rubbing her eyes, she reached for her phone and answered the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello?" she mumbled.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, it's me. I'm sorry to bother you so late, but something's happened with Cecil. He's locked himself in his room, shouting and making a scene. We can't get the door open, and he keeps demanding to see you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana froze for a moment, trying to make sense of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What on earth is going on with Cecil in the middle of the night?" she thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at the calendar beside her bed&mdash;November 27th.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chill ran down her spine as she recalled the past. In her previous life, Cecil had died in November, and his body wasn't discovered until days later. His exact date of death was around this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something was definitely wrong. "Madam Farley, please hold on. I'm coming right away," Diana replied, fully awake now.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hung up and quickly got out of bed to get dressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing the urgency, she rushed to her wardrobe and put on warm clothes, grabbed her phone, and headed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she opened her bedroom door, she realized she didn't have a car.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she remembered that Steven's garage was likely stocked with vehicles.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana hurried downstairs to find the car keys. Sure enough, she saw a set of keys on the entryway table.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grabbed them and headed out the door. Steven, who hadn't slept all night, watched as she anxiously ran toward the garage. He frowned, wondering, "Where is she going at this hour?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven quickly dressed and followed her outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Diana got into the car, Steven opened the passenger door. She looked at him, annoyed. "What are you doing? Get out. I'm in a hurry, and you'll just complicate things."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven coolly reminded her, "This is my car."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana, already anxious, snapped back quickly, "We're still married. This car is considered joint property, so get out. I have things to do."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven paused, momentarily taken aback. He thought, "Now she is acknowledging our marriage?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems we are only married when it suits her."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are you going? I'll go with you. It's too late, and it's not safe," Steven insisted, his voice firm. He worried that someone might be tracking her, and she could be in danger at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing how stubborn Steven could be, Diana didn't waste time arguing. She simply started the car and drove off.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the road, Diana's driving was both steady and fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven suddenly remembered the night he had seen her racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her movements were graceful and confident, and that night, she had left him utterly amazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curious, he asked, "When did you learn to race?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana replied, "Probably around thirteen. I trained at a professional course. It was exhilarating, so I practiced for about two hours a day.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There were so many things to learn, though. I didn't get that good at it."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's lips twitched at her humility. He thought, "Not that good? She's better than Elroy. "</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even he had been left far behind by her skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It dawned on him that he was the one who wasn't good enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew luxury cars inside and out, thanks to Hubery, who was passionate about cars. But racing was dangerous, so Leopold hadn't let Leopold join that field professionally.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Leopold found out she had been racing with Hubery, he punished Hubery severely.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, Hubery never dared to take her racing again.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about design? How old were you when you started studying that?" Steven asked, struggling to believe she could excel in so many areas.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When you first saw me back then, I was sixteen. I was admitted as an exception. Didn't you know that? If you did your research, the dean would have told you."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="665.html">« Prev</a><a href="667.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
