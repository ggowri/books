But Luna beside her seems to be very powerful.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The family adopted her seems to be unusual."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mario frowned and shook his head, "Ms. Marsh, I have already checked that old man. He is ordinary. He has no real power and no company under his name."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "Diana's identity is very simple, and not much information can be found.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana is really ordinary."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mario continued, "She has been a housewife beside Steven for the past two years. Even if she knows a little bit about design, it's no big deal."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had investigated Diana, and nothing good was offered.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't finish high school, and they all knew it.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie felt that something was wrong, so she asked, "Did you find the hacker?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was in urgent need of talented people to help her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mario answered, "I found a very good person in the industry. I will bring him to see you tomorrow."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie nodded. "Okay! Do it secretly. Don't let people who know me see it."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mario nodded and left.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only then did Queenie lie leisurely on the sofa.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's attitude made her feel a strong sense of crisis.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew did not go to find Steven.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking that Steven did not go to the police station to rescue her, her breathing paused for a few seconds.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie even felt Steven looking at her with disdain. She thought, "Diana actually managed to save those photos. After sending them to her, I clearly withdrew them within seconds."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie bit her lip, and her tender red lip was almost bleeding.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was annoyed. She picked up her cell phone and called Steven.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's current attitude made it impossible for her to control him, as if many things were out of her control.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She made three calls in a row, but no one answered from Steven's end.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie sat on the sofa, her eyes full of gloom, thinking, "Steven, even you don't want me anymore?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the company, the lights in Steven's office were on.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at the several calls from Queenie. But he didn't answer any of them.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, Evan walked in and said, "Mr. Gellar, Cecil and Ms. Marsh have left the police station. The male waiter who drugged at the party has been arrested. His reason was that Cecil was arrogant and had bullied him before. He felt that his self-esteem was insulted, so he drugged Cecil. They all went back."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven listened. His handsome face was cold. Then, he said, "Go check what happened between Queenie and Jace."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan looked serious. After so many years of working, he saw what Jace was up to. "Mr. Gellar, I suspect that Jace and Ms. Marsh want the Farley family."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="346.html">« Prev</a><a href="348.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
