In the past, Steven wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t have dared, and Diana would never have let him get this close.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's gaze lingered on Diana as he said, "Diana, you..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stopped himself. Now wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t the time to say more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He raised the gift box in his hand and said gently, "I brought you a gift from my trip. This diamond bracelet&mdash;I</span><span>'</span><span>m sure you</span><span>'</span><span>ll love it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glanced at the gift box but didn</span><span>'</span><span>t reach for it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She smiled and said, "Alexander, I can</span><span>'</span><span>t accept such an expensive gift."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The last diamond necklace she accepted, worth $500 million, was still locked away in her safe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana once thought about finding someone to rely on, but now she felt having Steven was enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander firmly pressed the gift box into her hands, saying, "This represents my feelings. Please, take it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a gift he had carefully chosen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana reluctantly accepted it, planning to return it another day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She smiled and said, "Thank you, Alexander."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander gazed at her radiant smile and chuckled bitterly, "I'll wait for your divorce."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He shot a defiant glance at Steven before turning and walking away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stood there, puzzled, sensing that Alexander might have ulterior motives.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You care about him that much?" Steven's voice suddenly cut through, dripping with jealousy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana snapped back to reality, a wave of tension washing over her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking into his intense eyes, she couldn't help but smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's smile only made Steven more agitated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He leaned in, pressing his forehead against hers, and whispered, "Darling, don't smile at anyone else like that."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words dripped with a lingering tenderness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt her heartbeat quicken.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, someone chimed in, "Keep it professional. This is the office entrance&mdash;save the romance for home."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold was teasing them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was then Diana noticed Leopold, Tobias, Julius, and Olivia had all arrived.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grandpa! What brings you all here?" she exclaimed in surprise and delight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven nodded politely to everyone in greeting.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold warned him sharply, "If you ever hurt Diana again, you</span><span>'</span><span>ll answer to me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sir Bishop, I promise I</span><span>'</span><span>ll never hurt her or make her cry again," Steven vowed solemnly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let</span><span>'</span><span>s hope you keep your promise. If it weren</span><span>'</span><span>t for Edward, I</span><span>'</span><span>d never have agreed to this marriage," Leopold said dismissively.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Back then, watching you so stubborn, Edward begged me to step in. I had no choice but to go to your office myself and tell you&mdash;it wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t Queenie who saved you, it was Diana."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana gasped in surprise, "Grandpa, why didn</span><span>'</span><span>t I know about this?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She never expected Leopold had kept so much from her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold said, "It was all Edward</span><span>'</span><span>s idea. When you wanted a divorce and Steven treated you poorly, I was ready to bring you home. But Edward begged me on his knees to help you two. So, I went to Steven</span><span>'</span><span>s office and told him it was you, not Queenie, who risked everything to save him from the fire."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thinking about the pain you went through back then just breaks my heart."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I would never let Queenie take credit for what you did."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had always thought Leopold loved her the most, but in her darkest moments, he had sided with the Gellar family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She turned away angrily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias chuckled and said, "Diana, don't be mad. Let's arrange a proper talk between our families soon."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Tobias Bishop is right. How about we have dinner together tonight?" Edward suddenly appeared and suggested.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sir Gellar! You're awake!" Diana exclaimed in surprise and delight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, it's all thanks to your medicine. I only trust yours," Edward said warmly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana let out a relieved smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven took her hand and said to Leopold, "Thank you, Sir Bishop."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He bowed deeply. The moment he learned Diana had saved him, it gave him purpose. He quickened his pace, determined to win her back as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold sighed, "I hope I made the right choice. Seeing you both so happy puts my mind at ease."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Edward's right. Let's have a proper talk tonight."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright," Steven agreed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edward smiled with relief. A good outcome was worth the wait.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they had failed, it would</span><span>'</span><span>ve been cruel of God to both of them. But this is the best outcome.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You take care of things here. We'll wait for you at the Gellar Manor," Leopold said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One by one, everyone left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked utterly confused.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you think they're hiding a lot from us?" she asked Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven shook his head, unsure. Over the years, he had lived like an empty shell, incapable of loving anyone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But over the past year, he finally found himself again, understanding his own heart. He cherished this year&mdash;because the woman he loved was still by his side.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "Diana, it was my grandfather who insisted I marry you. Looking back, it seems there are still many secrets between them that we don't know."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We'll find out tonight," Diana said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, let's go," Steven nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as they were about to leave, someone called out to her. "Diana."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The familiar voice made Diana freeze in her tracks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Turning around to see who it was, Diana frowned and said coldly, "Mrs. Paula Marsh, is there something you need?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1116.html">« Prev</a><a href="1118.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
