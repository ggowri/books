"Why did you sign her up without telling me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie hadn't expected Diana to spill the beans so openly and felt the need to defend herself. "Steven, I did it to help Diana! She doesn't have a degree or come from a prestigious school. If she wins this fashion competition, it'll boost her reputation at the company. I'm just trying to give that country girl a leg up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven raised an eyebrow, a mocking smile creeping onto his face. "So, the clown here is you, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie flinched at his words. "What do you mean by that, Steven?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He made it clear with a cold tone. "You're just digging your own grave, making a fool of yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the people around them, she would have exploded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, don't forget that I'm still your fianc&eacute;e in front of everyone..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cut her off. "I'll announce to everyone today that you're not my fianc&eacute;e; you're just the other woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strange smile played on Steven's handsome face as he leaned closer to Queenie. "Queenie, if I spill the beans, do you think Zion will still treat you with respect?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie shuddered, suddenly realizing the gravity of his threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Steven, she was nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was indeed Steven who had elevated her status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For years, being known as Steven's fianc&eacute;e had kept people polite and cordial toward her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She begged, desperation lacing her voice. "Please, Steven. Remember that time I saved you? Don't reveal the truth. I won't mess with Diana anymore. Today is a big day for her; it's a chance for her to grow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven shot her a cold glance, his patience wearing thin. "Queenie, do you know what happens to those who deceive me? You've seen how I deal with others. One day, I'll use those same tactics on you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned and walked away with Evan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie clenched her fists, frustration boiling over as she hurried after him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blocking his path, she taunted, "Steven, the reason you won't help me now is that you know what I've done to Diana. But don't forget how starved for love she is.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She treated you so well because you pulled her away from the Marsh family. Once she returned, they didn't want her back. I've seen her cry; I've seen her at her lowest. Yet, she chose to stay with you because she loved you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what did you do? You pulled a stunt that she will never forgive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You gave all your love to me while hurting her time and again. You left her shattered, Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You tossed her aside on the highway, abandoned her in the freezing cold. Don't you see? You've loved me all along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's been over a decade, and your heart has always belonged to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie decided to make one last desperate attempt, contrasting how Steven had treated her with the pain he had inflicted on Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Steven's expression shifted; he realized that Queenie was fully aware of everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, he had thought Diana was cruel, which was why he had chosen Queenie. But he had known one thing for sure, he didn't love anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the truth was, his feelings for Diana had grown deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, every time I hurt her, it was because you pushed me to it," he said, his voice heavy with regret.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="840.html">« Prev</a><a href="842.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
