He smiled apologetically and said, "Diana, I'm not like Frank. I can see how talented you are."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Powell, her talent comes from warming Nolan's bed!" A grating voice cut in.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked over to see Queenie and Steven approaching arm in arm.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie wore a fake, saccharine smile.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shot her an icy glare. "Watch your mouth!" she snapped.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie gave her a pointed look. "Why so hostile, Diana? I'm just telling the truth."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smirked and raised an eyebrow. "Truth? Aren't you and your brother the ones spreading lies about me online? For someone so selfless, you sure didn't mind your dad snatching Frank's deal. You've lost his affection now. A useless brat like you who can't even cook - if you keep burning bridges, you'll end up starving to death."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana didn't hold back; Queenie had nothing on her when it came to being harsh.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Over the years, Queenie had often sent messages to provoke her. When Steven wasn't around, she'd kick it up a notch, taking her shamelessness to new heights.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The thought of Steven's favoritism stung like a needle in the heart.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie put on her best innocent face, but her smile gave her away. "Come on, Diana," she said sweetly, "you can't just go around pointing fingers without any proof. That's not cool. And about my brother's business? It just wasn't up to that big deal. It's nothing like what you're saying. You've always had a thing for making stuff up, haven't you?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She shook her head in mock sadness.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana lacked concrete proof, but that didn't stop her from lashing out. "Queenie, you know damn well whether I'm making this up or not. You make me sick to my stomach just looking at your vicious face."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie instantly put on a hurt expression, looking so pitiful you'd think she'd suffered some great injustice.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana found it ridiculous. "Playing the victim again!" she scoffed inwardly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you acting all hurt for? You're the one who came looking for trouble. Why do you always have to push your shamelessness to the limit, then run crying to other people's husbands for comfort?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven had heard enough. His voice was cold as he spoke. "Diana, that's enough. Stop it. Since when did you become so mean?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana glanced at Queenie, who was nestled pitifully in his arms. "If I wasn't mean, how could Queenie use me to show off her gentle nature? She's always begging for a reality check. If she's gonna serve herself up on a silver platter, why should I refuse?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's face turned pale, her eyes glazed over with anger. Diana had gradually gained the upper hand while she was practically exposed for who she indeed was.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander spoke up at the right moment. "You two should leave. Please don't disturb our meal."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven looked deeply at Diana, his expression showing signs of anger, and he led Queenie towards their reserved table.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana lowered her gaze, avoiding the sight of the two together.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander watched her with concern. "Diana, you still can't let go, can you?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled and said, "I have let go, but sometimes my heart has a mind of its own."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander understood and didn't press further.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The kitchen started serving their dishes. It's prime lobster, grilled squid, and steamed grouper. Each dish was a classic.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana ate with gusto, especially enjoying the grilled squid.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana beamed with happiness. "Alexander, I'm heading back to Rihull Island soon. I'll catch some fish and shrimp myself next time. This is just too good."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander smiled, "Sounds great! I love diving and beachcombing too. Why don't I join you next time?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Perfect!" Diana said, digging into her squid. It really was delicious.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tender and flavorful, she left the meal feeling completely satisfied.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After dinner, Diana headed to the restroom.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she exited, she spotted Steven at the end of the hallway. He stood in the shadows, his rigid posture exuding an intimidating aura.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven had been waiting specifically for her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing her emerge, he strode towards her with purposeful steps.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, when will you stop this game?" he demanded.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="311.html">« Prev</a><a href="313.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
