You don't have to worry about other things. I will prescribe medicine for Priya. The medicine for this disease is a special and exclusive medicine in my hospital. Even the medical equipment is exclusive. The technology is mature. I have already established two such hospitals abroad. Priya will gradually get better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph thought of what he had heard that day when Diana talked to Tom. The medicine was very expensive, more than one million dollars, and the later medicine would be even more expensive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, why are you helping me so much?" Joseph didn't understand. They just met by chance, but why did Diana help him so much? The medical expenses were millions or even tens of millions. Most people couldn't do this for others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled and looked at his handsome face, "Joseph, I'm helping you, but in fact, I'm helping myself. I have the ability and will try my best to do what I can. I don't ask for anything in return. If you can study well, it will be the best reward for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her previous life, she died, and all her money was in the bank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life, Diana would do what she could and help those in need just to live a healthy and happy life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, "I don't want my kindness&nbsp;to become a psychological burden for you, so just accept it at ease. The most important thing for you now is to study hard. Call me if you need anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph nodded seriously. "I promise!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Bishop." Evan suddenly came to Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Evan? Why are you here?" Diana asked in a slightly cold voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan felt very sorry. He said apologetically, "I'm sorry, Ms. Bishop. If I hadn't stopped the car today, you wouldn't have had a car accident."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had just checked Diana's medical records and found that her injuries were quite serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at him. Evan was a good guy, and he was the most loyal person around Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, "You don't have to feel sorry. What happened today is not your fault. That person had been following me all the way. Even if nothing happened today, something would happen at other times."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan did nothing wrong, so Diana wouldn't blame him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan looked at her worriedly. "Ms. Bishop, you were seriously injured. Why did you leave the hospital?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana doesn't like staying in the hospital. "I have a family doctor, and I can go back for treatment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan knew that Diana might have an extraordinary status. Otherwise, she would not have been able to save Steven back then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar is...waiting for you in the car," Evan said and lowered his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven came out of the hospital but did not leave. He sat in the car and waited for Diana as if he knew she would come out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intense hatred flickered in Diana's eyes. "Tell him to get lost and not to come to me again except for the divorce."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan said, "Mr. Gellar regrets it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He won't regret it. He has no feelings for me at all. Tell him what I said, and he won't make things difficult for you." After Diana finished speaking, the car she hailed arrived. She opened the door and got in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph hurriedly followed and got in the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh..." Evan scratched his head and thought, "Why did that brat follow Diana? Mr. Gellar is watching over there in the car behind. He will be even angrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan hurriedly went back and got in the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven had seen that scene, and his eyes were cold. He thought, "Diana dares to go home with another man."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="477.html">« Prev</a><a href="479.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
