"Ha ha... Damn it, this is... killing me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana Bishop, fearing they'd laugh themselves into oblivion, looked worriedly at the group and gently advised, "Guys, stop laughing. Haven't you heard that someone can laugh themselves to death?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The others fell silent, the laughter abruptly halting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric, tears of laughter streaming down his face, looked at Diana. "Diana, have you lost your mind after the divorce? Are you really challenging Mr. Morrison? Is it you who's gone crazy, or am I just having auditory hallucination?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana didn't even glance at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tall and statuesque, her hair danced in the cold wind, her beautiful face taking on an ethereal glow under the moonlight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She pulled a hair tie from her bag, tying her hair into a ponytail before saying, "Elroy, you heard me right. I do want to challenge you to a race, but we need to set a bet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Pfft..." Elroy couldn't help but chuckle again, sizing her up deeply. This girl was undeniably pretty and fiercely unafraid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Girl, with that weak frame of yours, do you have the strength to hit the brakes? Can those delicate hands even steer a car? Do you even know how to race?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"To challenge me, you better have the qualifications."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His tone dripped with mockery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other men looked at Diana with disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was speechless. How did she not have qualifications?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Morrison, I won't waste your time. If I win, you'll sell me that plot of land at the foot of Luspus Hill."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elroy was slightly stunned. That land was practically worthless. Why did she want it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His interest piqued, he asked, "What do you want that land for?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled. "To build a villa. The scenery there is lovely, and I really like it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elroy thought she was out of her mind. Buying such a large piece of land just to build a house?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He laughed. "Do you have the money?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana found his question childish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Would I challenge you without money? Or do you think you can't afford to lose?" Her last remark turned sharply mocking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elroy's expression darkened. How dare she suggest he couldn't afford it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He pointed at Eric, smirking. "And what about Eric Marsh?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana didn't look at Eric but calmly asked, "On what grounds do you think I would save someone useless and only bullies me for fun?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, how dare you call me useless? I called you here to save me, not to buy land," Eric insisted, still clinging to hope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, Diana turned to him, giving him a sharp look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her tone dripped with sarcasm. "What are you if not useless?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="437.html">« Prev</a><a href="439.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
