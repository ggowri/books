"Didn't you say you liked bunnies? Let me show you how."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven snatched the coin from Cecil and dropped it in. He guided Diana's hand to the joystick, setting his sights on the pink bunny.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keeping a firm grip on Diana's hand, he maneuvered the claw, caught the bunny, and quickly pulled it back. The pink bunny dropped perfectly into the prize chute.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was stunned. She had to admit Steven had severe skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd tried her luck at claw machines countless times but had never managed to win anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how determined she'd been, she'd always walked away empty-handed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow! Steven, you're amazing! How did you get it on your first try? I've played this game countless times and never managed to grab one of these plush toys."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes sparkled as she looked at Steven in delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her animated expression, Steven couldn't help but smile, "It's not that hard."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled out the stuffed bunny and handed it to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana accepted it, considering it her trophy.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She figured it was okay to take it since she'd earned it fair and square.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana finally responded to his comment, "Easy for you to say, you've got the knack for it and I don't."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven found her stubborn expression adorable. "Want me to get you another one?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "Nah, I only wanted this bunny. Not being able to get it was driving me crazy, but now that I have it, the thrill is gone."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven understood the feeling. "Yeah, I get that."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven reluctantly let go of her. "I've got a meeting at the office and dinner plans tonight, so I won't be home for dinner. Head home early, okay? Don't stay out too late."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana suddenly became aware of how close they'd been standing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She blushed and stepped back slightly, keeping her eyes down. "Go ahead, I'll hang out with Cecil for a bit."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven turned to Cecil, whose expression had soured, and said, "Mr. Farley, I'll leave my wife in your care."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was clearly marking his territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was itching to punch him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil shot him an icy look, responding with his typical spoiled attitude, "Don't bother. You're the real trouble here. Better go handle your business. After all, with Queenie's affair, you're the one wearing the horns."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven lost his word.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana could barely contain her amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lowered her head slightly, almost bursting into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil's usually charming eyes were now wide with disbelief, like a rooster about to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven shot a cold glance at Diana, who was struggling to contain her amusement, and walked away silently.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana could sense it, though; Steven was furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil started belting out behind him, "Oh give me a home, where the buffalo roam..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven paused, then straightened his back and continued walking.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was left speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Well, that was anticlimactic.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven hadn't lost his composure at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the one who had been roughly pushed aside moments ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, let's hit the mall, then grab some barbeque afterwards," Cecil suggested, deciding to play hooky from work, something he did pretty often anyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded. "Sure, let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She planned to visit Lily at the hospital after lunch.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once in his car, Steven found himself thinking about all the little moments between Diana and Cecil. He pulled out his phone, opened his browser, and started searching for dating advice.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he instructed Evan to drive.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan had gotten out of the car, too, and witnessed the whole scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was amazed to see how Steven was genuinely changing, finally showing that he cared about Diana.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="716.html">« Prev</a><a href="718.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
