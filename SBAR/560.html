If he doesn't want to, the other three won't either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even though Frank's fate is still up in the air, the only logical explanation is that he's off chasing Elsie again&mdash;he's crazy in love with her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie thought to herself, "Frank's gone for good. He's not coming back from whatever depths he's sunk into.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the other two brothers, I could easily set them up to get into some trouble and land them in prison."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula, fed up, yanked Eric's hand away and silently trudged upstairs, exhausted. "Once I get that divorce certificate, I'll unleash my most ruthless revenge," she vowed to herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Paula finally quiet down, Jeff felt a sense of relief wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't in a hurry; after all, he had stashed away a nice little nest egg over the years and even bought two villas. As long as his company stayed afloat, he could continue living the high life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff glanced at Eric, thinking, "What does he think he's doing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trying to take over my company?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not a chance! I can't let him stick around."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eric, you and your brothers are all grown up now. You can choose who you want to be with. Just remember, even if you stay with me, you won't be my son in name anymore!" Jeff declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Our family record has to be clean&mdash;no mention of Paula's kids. I can't have Amelie feeling upset about this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears sparkled in Eric's eyes as he replied, "Alright, Mr. Jeff Marsh, I get it. But before the divorce, let's draft an agreement. If you don't want me, then when you're old, none of us brothers will take care of you. And if you refuse to sign, I want 10% of your company shares."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was taken aback, thinking, "I knew it! This brat is definitely after my company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt cornered; his business was his only source of income.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine! I'll whip up that agreement right away. I won't need you to take care of me when I'm old," he snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a printer at home, Jeff quickly drafted a severance agreement for Eric to sign.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric looked at the document, bitterness creeping in. He mused, "So Diana has seen through those guys' true colors. That's why she signed the document and left without hesitation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the ink was dry, their fates would no longer be intertwined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Jeff deliberately, his voice steady. "Dad, think this through. Once I sign, you're no longer my father."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff frowned, urging him, "Just sign it already! I don't even want your sister Diana. What would I do with four useless kids?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric forced a smile. "That's fine! If you don't want me, at least Queenie does. She's my beloved sister, and we'll stick together no matter what."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Queenie with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie said, "Hey, Eric, if you're cool with it, you could stay and be my driver. I mean, finding a job with your degree from a third-rate college isn't exactly easy. Being my chauffeur sounds like a good fit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric replied, "Exactly! Being your driver would make me happy. No matter what anyone says, you're my sister, and our bond from growing up together is something I won't let anyone come between."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie noticed the tears in his eyes and realized how desperate he was. She smiled softly but didn't say a word, retreating to her room to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, a servant captured the entire scene for Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After watching it unfold, Diana felt little more than a flicker of indifference.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="559.html">« Prev</a><a href="561.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
