"I don't even deserve the courtesy of a little respect from you, yet you think you can demand it from me? And why should I write your son a letter of forgiveness?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Courtney began, "Diana, you&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough," Wyatt growled, standing off to the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he turned to look at Diana, and she met his gaze. He wore an impeccably tailored suit, and though well past fifty, he still exuded a mature charm that most women found irresistible. But in his eyes, there was a calculating glint, a touch of malice that was hard to miss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Bishop," Wyatt said. "My wife was raised in high society. She's used to being treated with the utmost respect and can sometimes be a little...proud. Please, don't take it personally."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He softened his tone and continued, "Ms. Bishop, I'm here to negotiate with you in good faith. Name your price, and I'll see it done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana merely glanced at Wyatt with a faint smile, saying, "Mr. Wyatt Farley, I know you're loaded, and people like you have always looked down on me. Money can do all kinds of things for you, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I'm not short on money either, and I'm certainly not about to forgive someone who tried to kill me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your son's arrogant behavior was trending this morning. Your company's shares are dropping as we speak&mdash;none of which concerns me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt took a breath before saying, "Ms. Bishop, my son is young and reckless. He didn't mean it. It was a brake failure. Can we just talk this out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana refused to settle privately. She knew that if she caved, Cecil would lose, too, because he couldn't stand a chance against Wyatt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Your son committed murder in cold blood&mdash;it was deliberate! And you actually expect me to give a murderer like him another chance? You want me to sign a letter of forgiveness? Sorry, but there's no way I'd agree to any kind of private settlement!" Her voice shook with emotion, and her eyes blazed with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Courtney heard that Diana refused to settle, a calculating glint flickered in her eyes. She scoffed, "Ms. Bishop, word has it your personal life's a mess. People are saying you had an affair with Mr. Powell...and with Cecil, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana narrowed her eyes, knowing full well that Courtney loved to hit a woman where it hurt most. She was skilled at twisting the truth and dragging others down with slander. Throwing dirt at her now wasn't out of character for Courtney, and Diana found it hardly surprising.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sneered, "Ma'am, those men are just my friends. But I've heard a few things about you, too. Like how you have a taste for younger men. You've got a young celebrity staying over at Pinecrest Villa, don't you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And at Willow Residence...there's a middle-aged man, fit, with sharp features, living there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe I should go into more detail? Or better yet, share all of this with Mr. Wyatt Farley, who happens to be here too. Should we tell him everything?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, if anyone's got a messy private life, it's definitely you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana figured if Courtney were going to sling mud at her, she'd just double it right back. Before coming here, she had already looked into Courtney's affairs. It turned out that she had been keeping several younger men, though Wyatt had no idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Courtney's face darkened, and she glared at Diana, furious. "What are you talking about? Diana, are you seriously trying to smear my name? Where's your proof?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching Courtney unravel, losing her composed, classy fa&ccedil;ade, Diana chuckled and replied, "If you didn't have proof, why throw dirt on me then? Funny thing is, I actually do have evidence. I just listed the locations, didn't I? So, unless you've got something to show that proves I'm the one 'getting around,' go ahead and bring it out."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="491.html">« Prev</a><a href="493.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
