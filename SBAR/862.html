"Don't talk now, save your strength first, and everything will be discussed after you give birth to the baby safely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn would never believe </span><span>Sam again,</span><span> and </span><span>she </span><span>looked at </span><span>Diana</span><span> with red eyes. "Miss, please, you must stay by my child's side all the time. It doesn't matter if I die, but my child must come into this world safely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled and </span><span>replied</span><span>, "</span><span>Y</span><span>ou'</span><span>ve</span><span> take</span><span>n</span><span> my medicine, </span><span>you will be fine</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have to be strong, try to survive, and pay me back the medical expenses. The medicine I just gave you is the best life-saving medicine. It costs two million dollars per pill."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two million dollars was so expensive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if Carolyn survived, she would definitely return it to Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nodded confidently. "Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It hurts... It hurts so much..." After her tense nerves relaxed, her belly ached, and her forehead was covered with sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car was spacious enough, and she lay on the seat, biting her sleeves tightly with both hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew the situation was not optimistic, and Carolyn still had to go to the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she took out her hand and called Tom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I'm watching the live broadcast. It really makes me angry. How can so many people like Queenie's hideous face?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tom, please get ready immediately. I have a pregnant woman here who needs to go to the hospital immediately, but there is a traffic jam here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah... What kind of luck do you have? Every time you go out, you either run into a patient or a pregnant woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said, "Tom, we are not far from the hospital</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>If </span><span>there is no traffic jam</span><span>, i</span><span>t will take 10 minutes to get there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom could hear the nervousness in her tone and comforted her. "Okay, don't worry, and I'll get it ready here. You can go to the delivery room when you arrive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Diana hang up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She </span><span>then</span><span> carefully helped Carolyn to adjust the fetal position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam was looking at the accident site not far away, and the car still showed no signs of moving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took out his cell phone and called the police, explaining that there was a pregnant woman and an ambulance and that there was a patient who needed emergency treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam kept on calling, and even though there were police on the scene handling the situation, the two car owners were still fighting and refusing to move their cars, as if they were deliberately blocking the road ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He got mad and asked them to move the car by force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My wife is going to have a child, and her life is in danger. Can you take responsibility? Isn't it just two scumbags fighting? Just forcefully pull them away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam called frantically over and over again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's cries of pain became louder and louder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah...it hurts... It hurts..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam looked at her weak appearance, became anxious and crazy, and hung up the phone angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>T</span><span>he fetal position was almost recovered</span><span> by Diana</span><span>, </span><span>though</span><span> she was sweating </span><span>because of nervousness</span><span>. After Carolyn took her medicine, the cervix softened quickly, greatly reducing the risk during childbirth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..." Carolyn screamed in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana growled, "Hold on, and stop screaming. Otherwise, you won't have the strength to give birth to a child soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn gritted her teeth and said, "Okay, I...I won't scream."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at Janet. "You, get down. I need to put the seat down, and there's not enough room."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't go down, and it's so cold outside. If I go down, I'll get sick from the cold. As a doctor, can you afford the compensation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet was very angry. Why should she get out of the car?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out!" Sam looked at Janet. At this time, she was still causing trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sam, it's so cold outside, and can you bear to let me go down and freeze?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet was unwilling to go down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was afraid that Carolyn would continue to talk nonsense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sam narrowed his eyes and threatened her, "Janet, I have never found you to be so selfish. Get out of here. My wife and children are in danger, and don't make trouble </span><span>any more</span><span>."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="861.html">« Prev</a><a href="863.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
