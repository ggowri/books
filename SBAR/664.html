But I think he's about to become an even bigger fool. Queenie isn't at rock bottom yet, but she'll cling to Steven with all her might. If the two of them end up having a child together, then I can get this divorce over with quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And after the divorce, I'm definitely going to find some handsome guys to have fun with."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana laughed wildly but standing at the door, Steven's handsome face grew darker and darker.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other end of the line, Olivia was exasperated. "You're always talking about finding a new boyfriend, but you're still a virgin! And you have the nerve to joke about male models?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's face flushed with embarrassment, and she quickly defended herself. "Olivia, just because I like good-looking men doesn't mean I'll cross the line. My best moment is saved for the one I truly love.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I find someone who loves me as much as I love him, then I'll give myself to him completely."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Diana spoke of this, a wave of sadness washed over her. The only person she had ever truly loved was Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had genuinely loved him. When Queenie sent her those videos and photos, Diana barely glanced at them before putting down her phone. It hurt too much to look.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia sighed, "Diana, in today's world, you're probably the only woman left with such ideas. Look at the women around you. Who doesn't enjoy themselves before getting married?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana paused.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Olivia, I really hate Steven, Queenie, and everyone from the Marsh family. I've been thinking, once I sort things out here, I might go abroad to find my brother."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should. You haven't taken a real break in years, so it's worth considering."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana replied, "Yeah, I'm fine. Don't worry about me. Just take care of yourself, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia said, "Alright, go to bed early."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana hung up the phone, feeling content as she settled back into bed. But suddenly, a dark shadow fell over her, startling her into a scream. She shouted angrily, "Ah... How did you get in here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's cold eyes glanced at her. Remembering what he had overheard, his expression turned sharp, and his entire presence exuded an icy chill.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, do you really want me to go to Queenie? Do you really want to push me into another woman's bed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was at a loss for words, her face flushing crimson with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being caught bad-mouthing someone was one of the most humiliating situations, and she desperately wished she could dig a hole and crawl into it. She had clearly locked the door, and she had no idea how he had gotten in.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since he had overheard, there was no point in hiding anything. "Yes, you heard my call, didn't you? Then you should know that you're next in line."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really want to see me dead? Do you really wish I were dead?" Steven pressed her relentlessly, regretting the question as soon as he asked it, knowing the answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana genuinely wanted him dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart clenched painfully. She had never treated him this way before.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded firmly, her eyes sincere. "Of course. Do you think I stayed here for any other reason? I stayed to watch you all suffer."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that no matter how strong Steven's tactics were, he couldn't beat Queenie and the man backing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice wasn't loud, but her tone was dripping with schadenfreude.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven took a deep breath. It was as he feared. "Do you hate me that much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought he was out of his mind. She thought, "Wasn't my hatred clear enough?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course. After everything you've done to me, do you think I should be grateful for the beating? I've met plenty of shameless men, but none as despicable as you."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="663.html">« Prev</a><a href="665.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
