After Gale came back, Penelope would also go there, and she announced that she was pregnant.</span><span> </span><span>She remembered it correctly, and perhaps it was in the next two days.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was getting closer to the match for Gale.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale had been busy in the race all these days.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He rarely came back. He would be much happier if he came back knowing he had a child.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Gale didn't come back in her previous life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale's car was broken by someone, so who was that person?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana didn't find out who the person was in her previous life either, and she only knew that the person was related to Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked over at Luna, "Luna, get someone to follow Queenie for the next two days and see who she's been meeting with lately."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna answered, "Alright! Ms. Bishop, you can take a break, I'll go arrange it right away."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "Okay."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She stood up and stretched her muscles.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had been sitting for too long, so she was sore all over.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah..." Diana relaxed her shoulders and neck, and she truly wasn't suited for a job in an office.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana walked over and sat on the sofa. She was in a good mood as she looked at the fragrant latte on the table.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She picked up the pure white mug and gently took a sip. A light milky flavor spread through her mouth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It tastes good," Diana smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As her cell phone rang, Diana picked it up and glanced at it, her eyes grim. Why was he calling her?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sneered at the thought of her meeting Penelope today. It seemed Queenie had called Gale to complain about what had happened today, which was why Gale had been so eager to call her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hello!" She answered the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, it's me, I'm downstairs at your office. I heard that you bullied Queenie again today, and I'm here to settle the score with you. I will give you three minutes, or don't blame me for making a scene in your office."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale threatened her arrogantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sneered, "Gale, I've cut ties with your family, and it was always Queenie who bullied me, but are you trying to teach me a lesson? Don't daydream about it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wait, I'll come downstairs, and I won't hold it back any longer."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana hung up the phone and went downstairs with her bag. In a few moments, she would be off work straight away, and she had a dinner date with Tobias tonight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana soon arrived on the first floor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale stood in the doorway, looking handsome and polite, but he was kind of stupid.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The four boys in the Marsh family were all spoiled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In particular, Jeff's parents couldn't care about his four grandchildren.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing that Diana quickly came downstairs, Gale sneered, "Diana, you came quickly. If you go back and apologize to Queenie, I will forgive you."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="88.html">« Prev</a><a href="90.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
