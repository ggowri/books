Sparring with Queenie added a bit of excitement to her otherwise mundane life.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Spending time with friends and enjoying meals together—that was what life was supposed to be about.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Helen glanced at her in silence and sighed softly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She could tell Diana was determined to go through with the divorce.</p><p style="text-align:left;">*****</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie hurried to find Andrew as quickly as possible.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Andrew was at his villa, casually eating breakfast.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He had a delicate beauty in his arms, sharing the meal with him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Andrew&#x27;s scandals were common knowledge throughout Capitole.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie couldn&#x27;t believe that once, when she was drunk, she had been violated by this man. Now, every time she saw him, she wanted to kill him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But she held back; she would take her revenge quietly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Andrew,&quot; she said coldly as she walked toward him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She had cried the entire way there, and now her tear-streaked face glared at Andrew in fury.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Andrew patted the young woman beside him and smiled. &quot;Sweetheart, go eat upstairs. Come back down later.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The woman shot Queenie a dismissive glance before heading upstairs.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Andrew looked at Queenie and asked, &quot;Why are you here bawling so early in the morning? And how dare you call me by my name? Queenie, you&#x27;re getting more and more out of line.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie scoffed. Rules? For a disgusting man like him, what rules? &quot;Megan and her son were caught.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;What did you say? How were they discovered? What did you do?&quot; Andrew was furious. Megan had been his sharpest tool for keeping tabs—how could she have been caught?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie met his gaze coldly. &quot;Because her actions were exposed.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Impossible. I warned you not to act recklessly before. Did you not listen to me?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Andrew was livid, glaring at Queenie with disappointment.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A woman who could never succeed, only ruin things—she was such a disappointment to him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie was equally disappointed in him. &quot;Andrew, haven&#x27;t I done enough all these years? Steven knows everything about us. His kindness toward me—it was all deliberate. He overheard everything you and I talked about in the garden back then.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;He always knew I approached him on purpose. He&#x27;s always known. But he doesn&#x27;t know about George.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Ha...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Hearing Queenie&#x27;s words, Andrew laughed angrily, his face darkened.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Steven, I really underestimated you.&quot; Murder glinted in his eyes as he angrily swept the steak off the table, sending it crashing to the floor.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Crash! The fine plate shattered into pieces instantly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I knew he wasn&#x27;t that easy to fool, but I didn&#x27;t think he knew all along.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Andrew stood, his tall frame radiating fury.</p><p style="text-align:left;">If Steven had always known, then what about his overseas businesses?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Damn it!&quot; Andrew kicked a chair in rage. &quot;So all these years, every move I made was under his watch.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie glared at him with hatred. &quot;That&#x27;s right. He&#x27;s been watching everything. He said that with just one word, your skyscraper would fall. Everything is under his control.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Ugh!&quot; Andrew was furious, nearly mad with anger. He turned to Queenie and pointed at her, shouting, &quot;Queenie, you useless fool! I put all my hopes on you. I wanted you to seduce him, marry him, and kill him, so my son could smoothly inherit the Gellar family. And now you&#x27;re telling me everything has been for nothing?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He had planned everything over a decade ago, meticulously calculating every detail and move.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was a precise plan, like an invisible web. He was certain Steven couldn&#x27;t escape his schemes, but now Steven knew everything?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Bring George back. If we can&#x27;t beat Steven in the shadows, we&#x27;ll fight him openly. Right now, there&#x27;s still an opportunity. We can use Steven to secure many deals.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">This was why Queenie came to find Andrew. Once George succeeded, she&#x27;d kill Andrew to vent her rage.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Andrew&#x27;s tone was icy. &quot;He&#x27;ll be back in a few days. In that case, there&#x27;s no need to hide anymore. Just go back for now.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I&#x27;ll let you know when I have a new plan.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie didn&#x27;t say a word and just turned to leave. Every time she looked at Andrew, she felt disgusted. How could such a hypocritical scumbag do such despicable things to her?</p><p style="text-align:left;">She used to respect Andrew, but now she realized this old scumbag didn&#x27;t deserve an ounce of her respect.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie hurried home, but on the way, she received a call from her mother.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A bad feeling crept into Queenie&#x27;s chest as she answered, &quot;Hello? Mom?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Amelie said urgently, &quot;Queenie, hurry to the hospital! Your dad&#x27;s gone crazy—he wants to do a paternity test with your brother!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie&#x27;s grip tightened on the steering wheel as she angrily asked, &quot;Mom, be honest with me—whose son is my brother?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Queenie, of course he&#x27;s your dad&#x27;s son! Hurry and come here—don&#x27;t let your dad do that test. Please come and talk him out of it. If he goes through with it, I&#x27;ll never forgive him!&quot; Amelie pleaded desperately.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie let out a bitter laugh, tears silently streaming down her face as she drove. She had cried so much that her lashes stuck together, irritating her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">At this moment, what was there left for her not to understand?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her brother wasn&#x27;t her dad&#x27;s child. How had things gotten so messy?</p><p style="text-align:left;">How could the world be this terrifying?</p><p style="text-align:left;">She thought she was a terrible person, but her parents were even worse.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Amelie, are you still trying to fool me? If my brother is really Dad&#x27;s biological son, why are you so afraid of letting him take the test?&quot; Queenie demanded.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Amelie became agitated. &quot;Queenie, I&#x27;ve lived in the shadows for him my whole life. Do I really have to let him insult me with this? No way. I absolutely won&#x27;t allow it. His distrust is an insult to me!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie shouted, &quot;Then let Dad do the test! If my brother is his son, it might even strengthen your relationship!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Amelie snapped back angrily, &quot;Queenie, no! Hurry up and get over here—I&#x27;ll send you the hospital&#x27;s address.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Before Queenie could say anything else, Amelie had already hung up.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Soon after, Queenie received the hospital address and had no choice but to drive there.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She couldn&#x27;t let this become a huge scandal—she still cared about her reputation.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The hospital wasn&#x27;t far, and with Christmas just a few days away, the city was mostly empty. With no traffic, Queenie arrived quickly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She parked her car and went to look for Amelie.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Coincidentally, the hospital she arrived at was one owned under Queenie&#x27;s name.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But Queenie didn&#x27;t know that.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula wasn&#x27;t feeling well today, so Eric came with her to see a doctor. Eric was the first to spot Queenie. He quickly said, &quot;Mom, isn&#x27;t that Queenie? What&#x27;s she doing at the hospital?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="889.html">« Prev</a><a href="891.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
