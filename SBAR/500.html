She thought, "Was he truly attempting to flaunt his sympathy in front of Diana?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You wish to disturb Diana? You must first survive. The fate of Gale and Frank is tragic indeed. Now, it's your turn. I'm eager to see how your beloved sister will let you die! Leave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her furious bellow caused Eric to recoil in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He watched her cold back disappear as his mind replayed Jeff's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Queenie aimed to meticulously plan and execute the demise of my three brothers and I, while also plotting to poison our mother, exploiting the cruel grip of Alzheimer's to then justify her confinement within the isolating walls of a mental institution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, our grandparents, unable to bear the loss, would eventually leave everything in Queenie's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a wickedly ingenious plan! It seemed that Diana and her assistant were aware of Queenie and Jeff's scheme, yet I was kept in the dark, used by Jeff and Queenie to harm those I held dear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie, Jeff, you turned my own family against each other. Don't think for a second you would find any peace from now on." Eric's eyes flashed with a murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie wouldn't profit a cent from any TV series she filmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would make her regret ever being born.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was curious to see how Queenie planned to kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had returned today, and Eric intended to go home first to confront Jeff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric glanced at Diana's workplace, remembering she was the chief designer there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Diana truly came from the countryside, how did she become a design director? How did her racing skills surpass Elroy's?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was only one possibility. Diana was exceptional, but her brilliance was overshadowed by their suppression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was a cowardly wretch. The moment Steven faced trouble, she fled abroad. The Marsh family clearly sought to cling to Steven's wealth yet blamed Diana for taking him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana married Steven for the sake of the Marsh family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, they showed no gratitude, wrongly accusing Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had Eric not learned the truth, he would have continued in his error.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric was in agony. Since his youth, he had been preoccupied with training and racing, neglecting his studies, leaving him unable to secure a decent job.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat in contemplation all of last night, only to realize his ignorance. If his mother's fortune were to vanish, he couldn't even support himself delivering food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he felt the profound sadness of his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To claim Paula's estate and wealth, Jeff had ruthlessly molded his sons into useless beings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His greed and selfishness, driven by a lust for riches, sacrificed his children's futures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric thought, "Led down a path of degeneration and incompetence, we lost our original luster and potential, becoming objects of scorn. The architect of this tragedy was the father I once respected."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon returning home, Eric encountered Queenie, who had just arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To aid his mother, Eric feigned the same doting demeanor as before. "Oh! Our little princess has returned?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie looked at him with a smile, her arm looping through his. "Eric, where have you been?" she asked.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="499.html">« Prev</a><a href="501.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
