That pink bunny is so cute!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil smiled gently, "Diana, if you like bunnies, I'll buy you a proper one instead. These arcade plushies shed a lot, and I've noticed you seem to have some allergies."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at him in surprise. "You're really observant! Yeah, furry things do make my nose itch, but it's not too bad."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not too bad? Last time at the mall, I saw you sniffling the whole time we passed the plush toy section. You were clearly uncomfortable."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His concern touched Diana, but she still wanted to try her luck. "That's no big deal. Let's give it a few tries. It doesn't matter if we don't win anything! It's about having fun!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well... alright then." Cecil happily bought Diana a bunch of tokens.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here you go. Try it yourself first, and if you can't get it, I'll help. This happens to be my specialty."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana inserted a coin and tried to catch a plush toy, but it wasn't her strong suit. She failed five times in a row.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil watched her growing frustration and said, "Diana, watch me work my magic."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a playful smile, Cecil put in his coin and grabbed the controls. He failed on his first try, then his second.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey! I thought you said you were good at this!" Diana shot him a skeptical look.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil gently tapped her pouting lips, his voice full of affection. "Silly girl, getting one out of five tries would be lucky. Don't you know these machines are designed to empty your wallet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana froze for a moment, Cecil's warm gaze making her lips curl into an involuntary smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was oblivious to the adoration in Cecil's eyes, her attention wholly captured by the adorable pink bunny.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Steven noticed. Man to man, there was an inherent understanding. Cecil had seamlessly woven himself into Diana's life, and the tenderness in his gaze revealed genuine affection for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eyes burned with fury, a wave of jealousy and anger washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was his, and no one was going to take her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was about to succeed, with Diana excitedly watching the bunny nearly reach the prize slot, when suddenly someone bumped Cecil's hand, causing the bunny to slip away.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who touched me?" Cecil whirled around to face Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was startled by Steven's icy glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Geez, you scared the living daylights out of me in this freezing weather! Steven, what brings you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was startled, too. They had been so engrossed in their conversation that they hadn't noticed Steven's arrival.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a word, Steven pushed Cecil aside and positioned himself in front of Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled her into his embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was enveloped in his familiar scent, a clean and fresh aroma that was utterly captivating.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stood there dumbfounded, looking up at Steven with confusion written all over her face. "Mr. Gellar," she stammered, "what... what are you doing?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="715.html">« Prev</a><a href="717.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
