Steven wouldn't just stand by and let this happen to her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, I really didn't do anything wrong. Please help me; I'm scared," she pleaded, looking fragile and on the verge of collapse.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's deep gaze met Cecil's. "Mr. Farley, Queenie didn't do anything wrong. If you let her go, I'll offer you the Skyline Project."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil regarded Steven suspiciously, suspecting he was in cahoots with Queenie for the sake of cooperating with the Farley family. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine. But Steven, Queenie&mdash;if it's found that the accident involving Grandma's bodyguard is linked to either of you, I'll make sure you regret it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil turned to Rita. "I'll take you home to rest."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rita's sharp gaze fixed on Queenie. "Queenie, I may not have solid evidence, but you were caught on camera throwing something into the pool after you split up with Steven. Next time, you won't be so lucky."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she addressed her grandson. "Cecil, Diana is an excellent and kind person. You should spend more time with her. I spent just an hour with her, and I can tell she's genuine and down-to-earth."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil, recalling her skill, felt a twinge of envy and smiled slightly. "Ow... it hurts." Diana really hadn't held back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rita looked at him with concern. "Is your hand okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil shook his hand. "I'm fine. It just hurts a bit."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned, puzzled by Diana's apparent medical knowledge. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could she have treated injuries before? </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he dismissed the thought, reminding himself that Helen had found the doctor. Still, her bone-setting skills nagged at him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling frustrated, Steven turned to Queenie and said, "You should go home and rest. I have something to take care of."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie quickly grabbed his hand, looking at him pitifully. "Steven, aren't you going to stay with me? I'm feeling really down right now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without responding, Steven walked away, frustrated. He pondered Rita's words: after entering the banquet hall, Queenie had left briefly but returned quickly. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his eyes, Queenie was gentle and kind; she wouldn't do such a thing. It must have been Diana badmouthing Queenie to the old lady again. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This thought eased his mind a bit. Diana always seemed to be causing trouble.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recalled Diana's earlier accusation by the elevator&mdash;that Queenie had set her up. How could that be? He had witnessed Queenie's kindness firsthand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Steven's retreating figure, Queenie cried angrily. He had never left her like this before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula supported her, saying, "Let's go, Queenie, let's go home."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie nodded, feeling wronged. "Okay."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The banquet continued, with guests enjoying themselves, and the Farley family overseeing the event.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After getting into the car, Steven asked Evan, "Can you check where Diana is?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan pointed to a restaurant across the street, smiling as he explained, "Ms. Bishop is on a date over there. I saw her when I went to buy dinner earlier. The man she's with looks very handsome. It seems like Ms. Bishop is enjoying their conversation."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven opened the car door and headed toward the restaurant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, elegant and soothing music played. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was happily chatting with the man across from her, Alexander. He was young and successful, having returned to the country after working abroad for years. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew he would become one of the top billionaires in the coming years. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her previous life, she had met him at a banquet upon his return. In this life, thanks to her grandfather's introduction, she met him earlier.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana could hardly believe she was on a blind date with Alexander, the tycoon she had admired most in her past life. They were having a great conversation, sharing their experiences in Raventia.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven walked in, saw them, and was about to approach but was held back.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="31.html">« Prev</a><a href="33.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
