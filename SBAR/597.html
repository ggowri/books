Every night, he would savor the drink she prepared, and it always helped him sleep soundly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it had been almost a year since he left. During this year, he had suffered from insomnia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't had her tea in all that time, and he missed its familiar taste terribly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People often realized the value of what they had after it was gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had finally learned to cherish her, but it felt like it was too late to make things right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only thing still holding them together was their marriage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until the truth came to light, he wasn't going to let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt a sharp pain in her chest as memories flooded back. In those two years, she had desperately hoped he would notice her. Tears welled up in her eyes, and she quickly wiped them away. "Steven, when you were dating Queenie, you gave her all sorts of romantic experiences. You spent money on her, you spoiled her. But I married you, and I got nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had already started unbuttoning his shirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words made him pause. Seeing her tears filled him with a deep, aching sorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that's the kind of romance you want, then from now on, we'll do things that way," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I don't want to be in a relationship with you anymore. When did I ever say I liked that? That's what Queenie wants. You should hurry up and marry her, and leave me alone." Diana rejected him without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I never slept with Queenie. Why don't you believe me?" Steven's shirt was completely unbuttoned. He knew that no matter what he said, Diana wouldn't believe him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana lowered her head, refusing to look at him. His words only made her feel ridiculous. "Steven, I don't buy your excuses. The two of you make me sick."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven took a deep breath. He knew he was in the wrong and had no choice but to endure her harsh words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I'm tired." He yawned and headed towards the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana watched him move around her house as if it were his own, and it infuriated her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly picked up her phone and found Queenie's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then she hesitated. If Queenie knew she was staying here, she would likely show up frequently to cause trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Annoyed, she decided to call Evan instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Gellar."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana froze. "Why are you calling me Mrs. Gellar? Are you outside the villa? Come and take Mr. Gellar away. He showed up at my place in the middle of the night, acting crazy. I don't want my reputation to be affected."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan didn't know how to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whenever this couple fought, it was always him who got caught in the middle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Gellar, you and Mr. Gellar are married. You should be living together. I'm not outside the villa; Mr. Gellar drove there himself. Mrs. Gellar, I need to hang up now. I have some things to check, and I'll inform you once I've found out more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana frowned. Hearing Evan call her "Mrs. Gellar" felt strange, as if even he wasn't acting normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head slightly and stood up. Hearing the water running in the bathroom made her scowl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was proving to be unpredictable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat on the soft, spacious bed, wrapping herself in a warm, cozy blanket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was her favorite bed, with her favorite blankets. After things fell apart with Leopold, the things she missed the most were him, her three brothers, and this bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lay down, her face warmed by the room's heating, giving her cheeks a rosy glow that made her look particularly lovely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She closed her eyes in frustration, contemplating whether or not to call the police. But Steven was still legally her husband, and the police likely wouldn't force him out of her home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her anger, Diana banged her head lightly against the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blanket carried the soft, unique scent that was hers alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So tired..." she murmured, pulling the covers over herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Steven's phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sat up abruptly. When she saw that it was Queenie calling, a wave of joy washed over her, and she quickly pressed the answer button.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="596.html">« Prev</a><a href="598.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
