Looking at Steven's cold eyes, she laughed in anger. "Steven, just because you're dirty, you think everyone is as dirty as you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven sneered, "Then why were you so eager to cook for another man?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because his grandmother was sick. He burned the food, so I helped him make soup. What's the problem?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana didn't know how he found out or how he located the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't care about these things. She just wanted to divorce him now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Having died once, Diana knew where she went wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her previous life, she lived too humbly in front of Steven, causing her to miss too many things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In this life, she must cherish the people who were kind to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had agreed to the divorce as he wished, but he still provoked her several times. She would not be polite to him from now on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Listening to her righteous voice, Steven was slightly stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He returned the phone to her. "I just want you to pay attention to your identity."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana laughed angrily and mocked him, "Steven, you can't set an example yourself. Why do you expect me to be faithful to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven looked at her sharply, his eyes seeming to be covered with a layer of frost. After a while, he said softly, "Diana, be good. Give me some time to solve the problem."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked at Steven in horror. "Steven, have you been possessed? How can you speak to me so gently?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her memory, Steven was always cold and indifferent to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven frowned at her. Thinking of his previous bad attitude, he didn't speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana continued, "Steven, my only wish in this life is to divorce you. After the divorce, I will live the life I want. You will not be in my future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, she looked out the window and ignored Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's heart suddenly surged with anger. He looked at her delicate profile. He knew she was serious this time, but he couldn't agree to the divorce.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The car was silent. Evan concentrated on driving, but he still felt embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought to himself, "Steven deserves to have no wife."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They arrived at the Gellar Manor, and Diana got out of the car first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Entering the luxurious living room, she saw Helen sitting on the sofa, looking quite unwell, obviously sick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana quickly walked over. "Helen, how are you feeling?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Helen smiled lovingly, "Diana, you're here. I'm fine. I just have a stomachache."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stomachache?" Diana examined her. "It's not serious. Don't worry, Helen. Take two of the pills I gave you before, and you'll be fine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked at Zora not far away. "Zora, do we still have the medicine I brought last time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Zora came over and said, "Ms. Bishop, there should be some left. I'll fetch it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana nodded and then comforted Helen. "Helen, don't eat cold food anymore, and your stomach condition won't relapse."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Helen leaned on the sofa and smiled, "Okay. I'm getting old, and there are all kinds of problems with my body. Thanks to you, I've had a few comfortable days in the past few years. Now, you're willing to see me only when I'm not feeling well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Helen really didn't want her to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was kind and considerate, but Steven was blinded by Queenie, that vicious woman, and couldn't see Diana's good qualities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked at Steven across from her. "Steven, I agree with your divorce, but you can't marry Queenie. Now that you don't love Diana, I won't force it. Let her go."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="417.html">« Prev</a><a href="419.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
