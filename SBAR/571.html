"Penelope, I owe you a thank you! You've managed to confuse Gale, but don't worry, I won't be your savior. Instead, I'll hand over the evidence of your misdeeds to the police. Calling me was just your ticket to hell, haha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope's heart sank. "Queenie, you're shameless! Do you really think I won't tell Gale everything?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, that depends on whether you get the chance to tell him," Queenie said before hanging up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope crumpled to the floor, feeling utterly defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, outside the courthouse, Queenie spotted Jeff and a tearful Paula emerging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Annoyed, she dialed Mario.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mario, Penelope's lost all her value. Hand over the evidence to the police and let the world know about that girl's death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it. I'll deliver the evidence to the deceased's parents right away. I won't let her ruin our plans," Mario replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie hung up just as Paula and Jeff approached her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smirked at Paula, her voice dripping with disdain. "Stop crying. My dad didn't abandon you; you just don't know how to handle things. Seriously, as a woman, you should've managed the household while leaving the company to him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But no, you don't understand business, and now the company's bankrupt with mountains of debt. How do you expect my dad to pay it off? Here's 100 thousand dollars as a thank you for raising me all these years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula clutched her divorce papers, realizing that with the Foliot family's intervention, she had secured her freedom much sooner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused, "This is perfect! The Foliot family's involvement is my biggest help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Paula accepted the money from Queenie, she couldn't resist mocking Queenie, "So, Queenie, you're only worth 100 thousand dollars? You really are cheap!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paula, you..." Queenie's anger flared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough, Queenie. There's no point in getting worked up now that the divorce is final. Let's just go home," Jeff interjected, wrapping his arm around Queenie's waist while casting a sympathetic glance at the disheveled Paula.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a pang of guilt; after spending a lifetime with Paula, he knew he was being heartless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "I have no way out now, but I still feel bad for Paula.</span><span> </span><span>She's genuinely kind and gentle. If it weren't for her, I wouldn't have enjoyed these past twenty years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paula, even though we're divorced, we still share a bond. If you ever need anything, just reach out," Jeff offered, his voice softening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula scoffed, saying, "Now that we're divorced, there's nothing between us. Whatever happens, you're no longer my concern. I'll let the media know about our divorce, and my debts are not your problem."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff's eyes widened in shock. "No, no, Paula! We don't need to involve the media. Let's keep this private."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, but I'll be moving to a rundown place outside the city. You better hurry up and pack, or the authorities might kick you out," Paula retorted, turning to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she walked away, a triumphant smile crept onto her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula thought, "Jeff, just wait. The real show is about to begin. After a year of preparation, I can finally breathe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff frowned, feeling a mix of confusion and unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Why does it feel like Paula's relieved after the divorce? And here I am, left with only Queenie, my son, and Amelie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, why does it feel like I've lost something so important?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, what's with that look on your face? Are you missing Paula?" Queenie asked, noticing his pale expression, her irritation bubbling up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff forced a smile and shook his head. "Nope, let's just head home and find your mom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sure! But remember, our relationship can't come to light. If Paula finds out, she'll make a scene, and with her skills, it'll be chaos."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="570.html">« Prev</a><a href="572.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
