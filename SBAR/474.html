"Diana, I'm sorry to implicate you because of my trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "It's okay. Some things are unavoidable. Since I've chosen to help you, I'm not afraid of these problems."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Cecil was so moved that he almost burst into tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in his eyes. He thought, "I'll be loyal to Diana all my life. She even risked her life to help me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil said, "Diana, when I came here, I received a call from my assistant. Jace had a big project, but a foreign company snatched it away. Could it be..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was stunned. She had almost forgotten about this matter because of the car accident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You mean..." Diana thought for a moment and asked, "Are you talking about the land of Lark Plaza?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah... Diana, how did you know it?" Cecil was shocked, thinking that she could predict the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana carefully recalled the events that had happened in her previous life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, she was sure about her guess. "It turns out to be that piece of land. If I'm not mistaken, that company will build an oceanarium there and use it as a research base for breeding marine animals in cooperation with the government.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This piece of land is very popular mainly because it is promising."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Diana died and became a ghost in her previous life, she heard Steven and Queenie talk about that. The research failed, and the company sold the land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, that place was developed into an oceanarium, and resorts were built around it. The business there was booming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana remembered that Steven finally bought the land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven, who later had a strange temper, became more and more gloomy, cold, and cruel. Diana thought he was scary, and she could only watch him from afar. Even Queenie was afraid of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil asked, "Diana, the oversea company is becoming more and more powerful, right? My dad is investigating the company, but there is still no clue."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled and said, "Don't worry. Be patient and wait."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are we waiting for?" Cecil was anxious. He couldn't wait any longer. Those people were too hateful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana raised an eyebrow and smiled, "When the ocean base project fails, we must buy that piece of land in the shortest possible time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, she couldn't let Steven get the chance. She had to become strong and take charge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was surprised. "Diana, will they fail?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded. "Yes. Jace lost this piece of land, and he is still in a rage."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil sneered, "He deserves it. He did it himself. If he knew the truth, he would be pissed off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought, "Fortunately, it's not the Farley family. Queenie's action is too fast. She obtained resources through such shameless means and knew the bottom price. How could she not succeed? Jace, you brought this result upon yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said, "Cecil, I won't let Samuel go or accept reconciliation. He acted boldly just because the Marsh family had driven me out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll handle this matter myself. You can go home now. Wyatt will take action. This time, you can expel Wyatt's men in your company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There should be problems with your project in Westwood. It's the main reason for your family's decline. I have no idea about the details, but I know that Wyatt's partner is a building materials company called Henson Group. The materials &nbsp;provided by Henson Group do not meet the required standard."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="473.html">« Prev</a><a href="475.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
