Trying to seduce me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, I'm starving. Let me treat you to a meal."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana nodded with a smile. "Sure. You've been here for two days. Go home and change first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil looked down at himself and took a sniff. He did seem to have developed a bit of an odor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Alright. I'll go take a shower first. I'm starting to disgust myself a bit."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sounds good! I won't go with you, though. I'll take a stroll around here. Call me when you're ready." Diana didn't want to make the trip again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil didn't want her to exert herself further. He pointed to a spot not far away, saying, "Diana, there's a commercial street just up ahead. You can browse around there. I'll come find you in half an hour."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana nodded. "Deal!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil strode away with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana and Luna headed in the direction Cecil had indicated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Woodston was a beautiful city, with many seasonal flowers blooming along the roadside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana loved it here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, she hadn't taken a few steps when Steven, who had come out of the police station, blocked her way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's tall and robust figure loomed over Diana, his strong presence intimidating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She took a step back, then remembered Steven was here as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana frowned at him, "Do you need something?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven stared at her intently. "When are you going back?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana shook her head. "Not sure."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Come with me on my private jet." His tone was brooking no argument.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana almost laughed. "I remember you bought your private jet the day Queenie came back. You once told me it was for her, and that I wasn't worthy or deserving to touch it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's breath hitched because he had really said that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"That statement doesn't count," he said in a deep voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana sneered, "But the hurt you've caused me is already done. Steven, I once had high hopes for you. I suddenly realize that when one invests too much hope and expectation in a loved one, they hand over the power to be happy and to love oneself to the other person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Now, I understand that marriage is not a shackle but about mutual respect and tolerance. So, I will fulfill your wish to be with her, which will also make me happier. The love I once had for you was as fierce as the sun in the sky, and you filled my heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Seeing you unhappy made me so sad I couldn't eat or sleep. My deep love and attachment to you made me lose myself for a while, which is why I've been entangled with you for so long. Now I've learned to let go. Please stop entangling me as well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had learned to get over the past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana had indeed loved Steven passionately and unreservedly. She was not shy about this topic. Love was to be spoken loud and clear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everything she had done was out of love for him, yet she had endured so much grievance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven froze. She had taken back her love for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The hurt he had caused her was real and irreparable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven stood silently in place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana left with Luna. She had her plans for the night. She could not let Steven disrupt them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan thought helplessly, "What on earth has this guy done? Diana took care of you for two years and wasn't even worthy of sitting in your private jet? Queenie got billions of dollars from you and hasn't done anything for you, yet you treat her like a treasure."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie, at home, received the news that Diana had rescued Cecil.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After cursing Diana out to vent her anger, she sent out a message.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie gave an eerie smile, "Diana, just wait until you're dead."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="178.html">« Prev</a><a href="180.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
