I've been keeping an eye on their movements at all times. Diana is already safe; it was Cecil and Madam Farley who rescued her."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula took a deep breath, feeling much more relieved knowing that Cecil was protecting Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at the dilapidated apartment, and even though she had lived in a mansion for half her life, living here now didn't feel too unfamiliar.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smaller place feels cozier, and now that it was just her and Eric living here, it was quite nice.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as one felt happy, whether or not there was wealth didn't really matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula sighed deeply in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A lifetime was so long, and before reaching the end, no one knew who the one to accompany them to the very last would be.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had lived most of her life before realizing that some things must be experienced with the heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had already walked through thorns, and in the future, she would surely be happy again.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "After Christmas, your brother will be back. He also cares deeply about Queenie; I don't know whether he will choose to stay with your father and Queenie or remain by my side."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula watched with her own eyes how her four sons doted on Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more she thought about it, the more she felt like crying, so she could only get up and find something else to distract herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She went to organize the clothes in the wardrobe and whispered, "Eric, go back now and return after work, don't let Queenie suspect anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears glistened in Paula's eyes as she laughed coldly. It was Queenie's turn to cry next.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric looked at his mother's back and worried about her. Paula was also in pain; she felt that the happiest thing in her life was marrying Jeff.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they got married, she gave birth to several more children, his siblings. She had told others countless times that she had a husband who loved her very much and obedient sons and daughters.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even she herself was living in deception; none of her sons were filial, they only asked her for money every month.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Queenie, who was doted on by them, only knew how to ask for money but not how to make money.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Paula earned a lot, she could afford the children's monthly expenses, so no one thought there was anything wrong with their extravagant spending. People immersed in happiness often tended to overlook the negative aspects of those around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the heart was filled with sweetness and contentment, everything seemed to be covered with a pink filter.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those sharp flaws and unpleasant behaviors that were once glaring, under the glow of happiness, no longer seemed so harsh or unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And they, for this reason, overlooked the ugly side of Queenie. Diana's clarity made them feel she was very rebellious, and her warm smiles and sincere care were also perceived by them as being artificial.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, as they spoiled Queenie, her flaws were tolerated by them on purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Eric thought about it, the more he felt like a jerk.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had also done many things to hurt Diana for the sake of Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the afternoon, the matter between Queenie and Levi received even more attention due to Levi's behind-the-scenes manipulation.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had always maintained contact with Levi. Seeing this level of attention, she smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was well aware that in this era of information explosion, the trending held an unimaginable power.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trending was like a huge spotlight on a stage, capable of making her who was in it instantly famous.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who were originally obscure might become the center of attention overnight because of a striking tweet. Once they made it on trending, they could quickly attract the attention of countless eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her fans increased by one million.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The magic of trending could bring her career to new heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was somewhat worried that the attention could be a double-edged sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief surge in fame, if she didn't have enough substance to back it up, that shine might fade away as quickly as a shooting star.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she couldn't let Diana expose her scandals.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's biggest trump card was her marriage to Steven.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="704.html">« Prev</a><a href="706.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
