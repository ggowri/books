You're my little sister! I'd give my life for you if I had to."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie let out a soft laugh. "Don't be so dramatic. I'd never ask you to risk your life. It's just a small favor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"See, I've got my eye on this piece of land that belongs to Mr. Morrison. Since you run in the same circles as him, I was hoping you could help me buy it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric shifted uncomfortably, remembering last night's loss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elroy had won, and Eric was kicked out of their circle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie, I've been cut off. It was all because of Diana. I lost the street race yesterday. When Diana came to bail me out, she played me. Now Mr. Morrison won't let me hang with them anymore. Mom's cut off my allowance too. I can't even scrape together a million dollars right now." Eric's voice grew increasingly bitter. In his mind, it was all Diana's fault!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was shocked, her voice filled with disbelief. "Eric, how did this happen? What did Diana do exactly? Did she convince Mr. Morrison to freeze you out? And how does she even know Mr. Morrison?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking back to last night, Eric didn't want Queenie to know what a useless brother she had. He said, "Diana was the one who seduced Mr. Morrison. Queenie, which plot of land did you want to buy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Eric, the land is the least valuable land Mr. Morrison owns. I bought it as an investment. My friend says the scenery there is beautiful, and it might be developed into a tourist spot."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric was stunned. Diana could have known about the land's potential value. That was why she deliberately gambled for it last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie, did you ever mention this land to Diana?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie laughed. "Eric, I never told her. I heard about it from a friend. They said it might become a tourist destination, so I thought I'd buy it as an investment. It could be worth several times more in the future. You know I'm busy filming and can't come back, that's why I asked for your help."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric was shocked. "So how did Diana know about this land?" But he asked, "Queenie, Diana already bought the land. Mr. Morrison came to handle the paperwork this morning. She's been in there for a while now, the deal must be done."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What? Where did Diana get the money to buy it? Did Steven give it to her?" Queenie's voice involuntarily rose as if someone had stolen money from her pocket.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric thought of Steven and said, "Queenie, hold on. I'll call Steven and have him give you the land for free."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the other end, Queenie choked at his words. "Who did Eric think he was to make Steven give her the land?" she scoffed inwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric hung up and dialed Steven's number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hello," Steven answered, his voice deep as usual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven, here's the deal! Queenie's got her eye on that plot in Elroy, but Diana used your money to buy it. It's a funny coincidence that Queenie wanted the same piece of land.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana's just a country bumpkin. What does she know about real estate development? You should hand that land over to Queenie instead. You've always spoiled her, giving her whatever she wants. Once you divorce Diana and marry Queenie, it'll be your shared property anyway."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="449.html">« Prev</a><a href="451.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
