He couldn't even remember what he had done back then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he could recall was giving everything he had to those three women, only for it all to end up being a scam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie sneered as she looked at his devastated expression. Good&mdash;he deserved it. This was all his own doing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jeff, we were about to get married, and then you suddenly met Paula, that wealthy, influential woman. You dropped me like trash and chased her relentlessly. Do you know how much that hurt me? We're both women, but while you lived the high life with her, I was forced to hide in the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you even remember how much money you gave me the first time? It was 200 thousand dollars. Coming from the countryside, I was dazzled by that amount. Do you know how tempted I was?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You gave me that much every month after, feeding my ambition. But even before you, I already knew Mark. He was giving me plenty of money too. Thanks to you two men, I've never suffered, but I've lived a life in the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I treated you that way because I was unwilling to accept my fate. If we'd gotten married, I could have been your rightful wife, and Queenie wouldn't have ended up as an illegitimate child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All Queenie ever wanted was to be recognized as your legitimate daughter, the eldest lady of the Marsh family. But what did you do? You enjoyed decades of comfort, refusing to divorce Paula until I forced your hand and turned your sons into good-for-nothings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie broke into angry tears. She regretted everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She regretted marrying Jeff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Paula, Jeff was nothing. Now he had nothing, and her future had no security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jeff, life has flown by, maybe because I had it too easy. Looking back now, it all feels like it happened just yesterday."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lifted her gaze toward Jeff, her eyes burning with fury. Clenching her fists, she trembled with rage, her face full of resentment. "After you got married, I thought I could marry Mark. But he looked down on me for not having a respectable family or background. His parents rejected me too, and things between us fizzled out. I could only see him in secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've worked so hard to climb up in life&mdash;this way, that way&mdash;but I'm always the one who's abandoned. Why is it that I'm always thrown away, while Paula is the one you all cherish like a princess?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes, she thought she was shameless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was no turning back now. Ever since Jeff handed her that first unearned 200 thousand dollars, she could never return to her old life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula was so wealthy that she didn't even care when her company lost billions of dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought everything Paula had would one day be hers, but in the end, it was all just an empty shell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She still had nothing, and her resentment was overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff let out an angry laugh. When people are at their breaking point, all they can do is laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff stared at her, expressionless. "Amelie, I worked so hard to earn money for you. Each year, you wanted more. To send our son abroad for school, I increased your allowance from three million dollars to 20 million dollars&mdash;more than what most families earn in a lifetime, all in just one year! What more could you possibly want? And why did you cheat on me? In the end, not even the boy is mine. Do you think that's fair to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff's furious roar was heart-wrenching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? The boy&mdash;Amelie cheated on you, and he's not even your son?" The moment Tracey arrived and overheard, she stumbled, looking like she might collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie and Amelie froze when they saw Tracey. Their heads were pounding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why was she here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, we've all been played by Amelie. Noah isn't even my son," Jeff said, his voice breaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff wept bitterly. He regretted everything down to his core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already cut ties with his four sons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Diana, she would never acknowledge him as her father again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tracey was furious. She strode forward with quick, angry steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie's face was met with a hard slap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie glared at Tracey. "How dare you hit me?" she spat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tracey cried out, her voice trembling with rage. "Amelie, have my son and I ever wronged you? I even cared for you during your postpartum recovery&mdash;I never did that for Paula! I gave you everything, and you repay me by cheating on my son?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tracey, in a fit of rage, grabbed Amelie's hair and forced her to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahh... Crazy old hag! Let go of me! Let go!" Amelie shrieked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie hadn't expected Tracey to lose control so suddenly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You wretch! I treated you so well, gave you everything, and all I hoped for was that you'd raise my grandson to bring honor to our family. But you destroyed everything!" Tracey yelled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you treat my son this way? He pampered you like a princess, let you live in a mansion, drive luxury cars, and never work a single day! I never even had that kind of life, but you did in your twenties. And yet you cheated on him. Amelie, you're just as vile as your mother!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Like mother, like daughter! Your mother ruined someone else's family, you ruined my son's family, and now your daughter is ruining my granddaughter's. Three generations of homewreckers&mdash;your family's truly cursed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tracey continued her tirade, cursing relentlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie stood there, dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Tracey had a sharp tongue, but she never imagined she could unleash so much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far away, Paula and Eric watched the scene unfold with cold indifference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, that rotten family won't see another good day from now on," Eric said flatly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tracey sure knew how to stir things up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They used to genuinely treat her like a grandmother, but Tracey never cared for them. In her eyes, they were just useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula scoffed. "That's not enough. Amelie's son has been living off me, using my money to start his company. Every year, 30 million dollars&mdash;I'm taking every penny of it back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula turned to Eric. "Eric, you're grown up now. There's no need to follow Queenie anymore. She's been exposed, and even Steven has given up on her. Without him, she's irrelevant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She may be clever, but she's nowhere near as smart as you. I want you to go abroad and destroy their company. Make all their years of effort come to nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way she would let that bastard Mark get off easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After raising his son for over twenty years, she was owed some payback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, we..." Eric started.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula cut him off. "Don't ask what you shouldn't. You'll leave for abroad tomorrow, and I'll tell you exactly what to do."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="891.html">« Prev</a><a href="893.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
