"Alright, Cecil, thank you. How's the investigation into the materials going?" She was still quite worried about it&mdash;the Farley family couldn't afford any trouble now as they were all in this together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil replied, "With the information you gave me, things went much smoother. I found out that all the materials had issues, and none of them met the national standards. But ever since Samuel's incident, both of their attention has been entirely focused on him. "This gave me the perfect chance. I reported the materials company today, and the owner got arrested. I also handed over all the raw materials our company purchased to the quality inspection department, then had them destroyed, so Wyatt won't have the chance to frame us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana let out a sigh of relief. "Thank goodness. We've looked into it, and my situation isn't urgent. We'll slowly drag this out in court. I'll keep Wyatt tied up for a while, so in the meantime, you need to work hard and clean out the company's parasites."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was all she could do for now. The rest was up to Cecil to fight for his family's business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you've really been a huge help these past few times. As long as we can get through this crisis, even though the losses are massive, making Wyatt bleed like this will be more than enough." Cecil's voice was filled with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After chatting for a bit longer, Diana hung up the phone. She set her phone to silent and closed her eyes to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Steven woke up, it was already noon. He felt groggy from sleeping so long, and his whole body felt weak and limp. Seeing the time, he was surprised. He had never been one to sleep in, yet today, he had somehow slept until noon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body felt relaxed, his mind was clear, and he experienced a sense of ease like never before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, Steven heard his stomach rumble. He got up to freshen up, and as he slipped on his slippers, he suddenly noticed the view outside the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At night, he hadn't been able to see anything, but now, in the daylight, the view from the floor-to-ceiling windows revealed a bed of Christmas roses, already starting to bud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Steven imagined how gorgeous this place would be in December, he couldn't help but like it right away. The setting was just perfect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint smile crossed his face, and he thought, "Diana sure knows how to live well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven finished freshening up and came downstairs just in time to see Diana getting up from the couch after her IV drip was done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor gave a few instructions before leaving. Diana stood up, her back aching all over. She frowned slightly and grumbled to herself, "Damn Samuel, I'll never forgive him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Bishop, it's time for lunch," Daren called out with a smile from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana responded, "Alright, Daren. I'm coming."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she slowly made her way to the dining room, she glanced over and spotted Steven coming downstairs. She was surprised that he'd slept this late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a total workaholic, always up at seven in the morning, without fail, and off to work right after breakfast. Seeing him sleep in here today caught Diana off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm hungry, Diana," Steven said as he walked up to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daren froze for a moment. "Wait... Why are you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's expression remained indifferent as he replied, "How is it strange that I'm at my wife's house?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daren was utterly dumbfounded, thinking to himself, "Wow. This guy iss shameless. He didn't leave last night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew how stubborn and overbearing Steven could be, so she said, "Daren, go ahead and have lunch yourself. Everything's fine here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still worried, Daren hesitated and said, "Ms. Bishop, if he gives you any trouble, just shout. The bodyguards are right outside." Hearing this, Steven furrowed his brows but ultimately stayed quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana handed Steven a fork so he could join her for lunch. Halfway through the meal, he said, "You didn't like the previous villa, so I'm planning to buy another one. Where would you prefer?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="486.html">« Prev</a><a href="488.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
