"No, Mr. Farley, please! You've already hurt me so many times! Just let me go this time&mdash;I hate you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, I can't do this anymore! I don't want to go through another pregnancy just to lose it again! I'm begging you, please, just let me go..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice cracked as she dissolved into sobs, shrinking into herself, trembling like a leaf in the wind. The raw emotion in her voice stirred murmurs among the crowd. Some looked on with pity, others with unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil's bodyguards, lurking in the shadows, finally sprang into action, rushing forward to restrain him before things spiraled any further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go... get off me... it's so hot..." Cecil's voice was hoarse, frustration dripping from every syllable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!" Diana's voice rang out, cutting through the noise like a blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl froze mid-sob, her tear-streaked face lifting toward Diana, eyes filled with what could only be described as hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana met her gaze with a knowing smirk. And just like that, she knew. The girl wasn't panicked. Her eyes were dry beyond the dramatic tears, her expression calculated beneath the supposed distress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you done?" Diana asked, her voice dripping with dry amusement. "If you're finished with your little performance, maybe take a breather. Your acting's terrible, by the way. Cecil's the one who's drugged here, not you. You are perfectly fine. So stop trying to play the victim for attention."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd went silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Playing the victim? Was she really saying that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization hit some of them like a slap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman's face stiffened. "What are you talking about? You think I'm pretending? Look around! Everyone saw what happened! How can you stand there and say that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I can say it," Diana replied with a lazy tilt of her head. "You're milking this situation for sympathy, hoping someone will swoop in and save you. If you want to marry rich, this isn't the way. Play the long game&mdash;win them over with kindness, not this nonsense. No man likes a woman who cries her way into his life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana wasn't just talking&mdash;she was buying time. If Luna showed up soon, this circus act would be over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie, of course, couldn't resist stepping in. "Diana, if you don't know how to keep your mouth shut, maybe just stop talking. Can't you see how terrified this girl is? Can't you see what Cecil just did? And you're standing there calling it an act? How heartless can you be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shifted her gaze to Queenie, their eyes locking in a silent battle. Queenie's smirk was full of triumph, confident she had the upper hand. Diana, however, remained unimpressed. "Heartless? What I do see is a girl screaming for help, begging Cecil to stop. But let's talk facts&mdash;she's conscious. He's not. If you don't believe me, why don't we ask him? Ask him if he even recognizes who you are."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Excuse me?" a woman in the crowd gasped, clearly rattled. "The victim here is this girl. Everyone knows Cecil's reputation. He's nothing but a spoiled, entitled rich boy. And now you're actually defending him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana let out a sharp breath, clearly unimpressed. "Oh, sure. People talk. They love to gossip about his lifestyle and make up wild stories, but let's get real&mdash;do you believe everything you hear? If someone started a rumor that you owed a million dollars in online gambling debt, would you believe that too?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only fools would fall for the rumors."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman's face flushed red with anger. "You&mdash;You're twisting things! Cecil's behavior is right in front of us! Am I really the only one seeing this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes narrowed slightly. This woman was a plant, no doubt about it. Queenie had made sure to stack the deck against Cecil tonight. But if she thought Diana was going to sit back and let this happen, she had another thing coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even seated in her wheelchair, Diana's presence was unshaken. "You're slandering him. You're spreading blatant lies. Are you blind, or just stupid? Look at him&mdash;does he look in control of his actions? If you want to act dumb, fine. But let me tell you this&mdash;Cecil has spent the past year building a company from the ground up. He's been focused, steady, actually doing something with his life. And you? You're standing here, trying to ruin him. I guarantee you&mdash;the Farley Group will be sending you a lawsuit for defamation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And anyone else who thinks they can slander him? I'll make sure you regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman hesitated, clearly rattled. Take on the Farley family in court? That was a joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't have the money for that, let alone the time or energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana already knew what Queenie was trying to do tonight&mdash;completely destroy Cecil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she wasn't about to let that happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, another woman stepped forward, arms crossed, voice dripping with accusation. "Miss, I don't know what's going on between you and Mr. Farley, but do you really think this is okay? He's humiliating this girl in front of everyone! Or is it because you have something going on with him, so you feel the need to defend him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shot Diana a pointed glare, full of hostility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana let out a slow exhale, her patience wearing thin. "Wow, that's some next-level nonsense. What, you just open your mouth and let the garbage pour out? You really think everything's filthy just because your mind is? Maybe check yourself before throwing accusations. If you assume everyone around you is rotten, maybe the real problem is you. But hey, keep going&mdash;trolls like you make the world a more entertaining place. Who knows, maybe one day you'll finally argue your way into flipping the Earth itself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman's face twisted with embarrassment, her mouth opening and closing as she scrambled for a comeback&mdash;but nothing came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Cecil, still restrained by the Farley bodyguards, was getting more agitated by the second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body burned, his head was spinning, and his vision was a mess of blurry shapes and colors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was one voice he could still recognize&mdash;Diana's. "Diana!" His voice cracked as he struggled against the guards, his movements frantic. "Where are you? Help me&mdash;I've been drugged!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He groaned, his frustration morphing into something almost desperate. "Ah... it's too much&mdash;I can't..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana arched a brow, watching his disheveled state with a mix of amusement and exasperation. So this was how it turned out, huh? He had invited her here to watch a show, and now, the spectacle was him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How embarrassing," she muttered, shaking her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual wave of her hand, she signaled one of the guards. "I have the antidote. Take it to him before he makes an even bigger fool of himself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguards, clearly anxious about Cecil's deteriorating state, wasted no time hurrying over to retrieve the medicine from Diana's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian Everhart, the so-called "victim", suddenly rushed forward and snatched the pill from the bodyguard's hand. She threw it onto the ground and stomped on it, grinding it beneath her heel with force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An expensive pill, reduced to nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's expression darkened. Her patience was wearing thin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, Miss." Diana's tone was deceptively calm, her eyes sharp. "Are you worried Cecil might wake up and call you out? So you thought smashing the evidence was the way to go? Bad news for you&mdash;that pill was 200 thousand dollars a piece."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian froze, staring at the crushed pill beneath her shoe. That was worth 200 thousand dollars?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of pill cost that much?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This... this... what the hell?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got to be kidding me! A pill that small costs 200 thousand dollars? Have you lost your mind?" Lillian nearly screamed in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's voice remained calm and steady. "My medicine isn't something just anyone can buy. The lowest price for one of these? 200 thousand dollars. Whether you like it or not, you're paying for it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not paying a damn cent! You're all in this together! You set me up! This is disgusting, bullying a defenseless woman like me!" Lillian's voice rose, playing the victim for all it was worth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana closed her eyes briefly, exhaling. Unbelievable. People like her really exist. Did she look like a weak, helpless woman?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people just couldn't handle a little kindness. Show them an ounce of sympathy, and they'd drag you straight to hell with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That pill was definitely worth 200 thousand dollars. If you don't believe me, take the remains to a professional lab. They'll confirm the price for you. In the meantime, do yourself a favor and stay calm. You don't want to end up paying even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because let me tell you something&mdash;whoever sent you here won't cover a dime beyond 200 thousand dollars. And knowing how stingy they are? If this blows up in your face, you're getting nothing."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1020.html">« Prev</a><a href="1022.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
