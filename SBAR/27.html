How could I have such a stupid daughter?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Diana, although you saved me, your request is too much,&quot; Rita stated, not expecting such an extreme demand.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Is it too much?&quot; Diana coolly smiled. &quot;Madam Farley, let me remind you that if I hadn&#x27;t rescued you from the swimming pool that day, those who plotted against you would have targeted the entire Farley family. By saving the entire Farley family, cutting off your grandson&#x27;s hands shouldn&#x27;t be considered excessive, right? Your grandson cyberbullied, mocked, threatened, and physically assaulted me.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana pointed angrily at Steven and Queenie, continuing, &quot;I was framed and insulted by them. And isn&#x27;t it because Queenie stole my credit?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven stepped forward and said, &quot;Diana, breaking Mr. Farley&#x27;s hands is too much. We misunderstood you. We apologize to you...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana interrupted him, &quot;Steven, shut up. You don&#x27;t even have the right to apologize. You have been the main culprit. You tried everything just to secure a contract with the Farley family.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven narrowed his eyes and looked at her, asking, &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana glanced at Rita. &quot;It&#x27;s up to the Farley family to investigate. It has nothing to do with me.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Do you not believe me, Diana?&quot; Steven asked coldly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana sneered, &quot;You have never believed in me, so why should I believe in you?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven was left speechless, shocked by her arrogant and wanton demeanor.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She was right. Since Queenie had returned, conflicts had arisen, and he had never believed in Diana, who had always been by his side during the most difficult times.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven was suddenly overcome with guilt.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana looked arrogantly at Rita. &quot;Madam Farley, if you have no objections, then I will take action.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Rita acquiesced.</p><p style="text-align:left;">While Cecil was stunned, Diana delivered a resounding slap across his face, causing him immense pain.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Anger surged within him, but before he could speak, another hard slap landed on his face.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Ten slaps later, Diana stopped.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Immediately afterwards, Cecil, who was dizzy after being beaten, suddenly felt severe pain in his wrist.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A scream echoed throughout the banquet hall.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Rita looked on in shock, her mouth agape.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Suddenly, another scream followed as Diana violently broke off Cecil&#x27;s hands.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Everyone watched in disbelief.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cecil curled up in embarrassment, writhing on the floor and glaring at Diana with intense hatred.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The pain was unbearable.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As a pampered rich man, he had never experienced such pain.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The room fell into complete silence.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The sound of Diana&#x27;s high heels reverberated, breaking the stillness.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana looked at Cecil, who was in pain. &quot;Cecil, I know you are rich and arrogant. I have endured so much abuse from your words. Do you understand the consequences when you said you would make my life a living hell?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You can be arrogant with your money, but don&#x27;t bully others or even think about taking their lives.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">In her previous life, she had suffered numerous persecutions, all because of Cecil. Influenced by Queenie, he had frequently sent people to cause trouble for her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In this life, she would not tolerate it any longer.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After speaking, Diana knelt down and held Cecil&#x27;s injured hands.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Unable to bear it any longer, Rita hurriedly intervened, her voice trembling. &quot;Diana, you have already taken your revenge. What else do you want to do?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="26.html">« Prev</a><a href="28.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
