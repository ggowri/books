"Just say it directly. Why do you want me to come over?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The wariness in her eyes deeply pierced Steven's heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't know when she stopped trusting him. She must have accumulated enough disappointment in him to be so wary.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since she wouldn't come over, he sat down next to her. The distance between them was very close.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana leaned uncomfortably to the other side, then gently poked his shoulder with her finger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Steven, don't sit so close to me. I'm not used to it. Move over quickly. You're too close, and it makes me uncomfortable."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana truly wasn't used to Steven being so close, as his presence made her blush uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Steven couldn't help but laugh. Her wary and guarded look, with her eyes wide open, made her look especially cute.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Diana, I won't do anything to you. I just wanted to tell you that after Andrew came back, I haven't heard anything from him. I'm worried..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana interrupted him, "Right, I almost forgot about him. Barry has been secretly watching him these past two days. He hasn't made any moves, so I can't figure out what he's up to. But I</span><span>'</span><span>m sure the box he</span><span>'</span><span>s carrying must contain something intimidating. It</span><span>'</span><span>s a specially designed box for protecting vials, and it</span><span>'</span><span>s temperature-controlled. The material of that box is very unique. I</span><span>'</span><span>ve already sent the photos to Julius, but I don</span><span>'</span><span>t know if he can find any information."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hadn't forgotten about this, but she wasn't sure what Andrew was planning, so she couldn't respond for now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only by investigating the Mysterium Organization could Steven's matter be completely resolved, as well as George and Queenie's. By then, she could look for her biological father and also stay with Leopold.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven frowned and said, "Could it be some kind of poison in there? Or..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hesitated a bit and didn't finish his sentence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought for a moment and said, "It's possible."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, every time she heard the name Andrew, she felt uneasy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's breath trembled slightly. Holding her hand, he said, "Diana, try to eat at home during this time. Andrew will definitely take the Gellar Group. This time, he'll be ruthless."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew Andrew's methods well and thought, "As long as the Mysterium Organization isn't eliminated, the danger behind us will never be resolved."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that case, Diana will always be in danger. I suspect my grandpa and mom are also hiding something from me. Maybe my grandparents went abroad just to keep me from being threatened."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana pulled her hand out of Steven's and glared at him. "Can you speak properly and stop touching me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's eyes dimmed. "Diana, I'm just worried about you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "You don't need to worry about me. Only when he starts moving will we have a chance. Queenie took over Owen's two companies. Also, the project she's working on with Yanson's company is making money right now, so she won't act at this moment. Let's just wait and see when she makes her move. However, we still haven't found any evidence proving she targeted the Toby family this time. She acted with her team, so the evidence disappeared very quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven knew Queenie was very cunning, but to investigate the Mysterium Organization, he had no choice but to tolerate her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took out his phone and showed it to Diana. "Diana, look at this woman. Queenie has met her a few times. Her name is Sandra, and she's the CEO of Queen Group. I suspect she's one of Queenie's people. As long as we follow her, we can uncover Queenie's hidden connections."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queen Group?" Diana smacked her head. "I totally forgot Queenie named the company after herself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana quickly picked up her phone. However, Steven stopped her. "Diana, I've already sent someone to investigate. I'll probably get the results by tomorrow. Just take a good rest for the next couple of days."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The company's new product will be launched in half a year, so she can take it easy for the next few months.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The spring collection design has been finalized, so she has time over the next two months.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just in time, he can spend some quality moments with her and deepen their relationship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, let's have a proper relationship, shall we? This time, I'll pursue you," Steven suddenly said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt surprised and shocked because this wasn't something the noble Steven would say.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the Steven she knew was emotionless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, she was angry and sad because Steven didn't love her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana even felt she couldn't hold on anymore. After all, it was Steven who didn't love her, and it wasn't her fault.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Love is free. If Steven didn't love her, she could forgive him. But he couldn't team up with others to hurt her. On this matter, she could never forgive him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her deeply. At this moment, seeing her expression change repeatedly, his usually calm heart was filled with tension.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana angrily said, "Steven, back then, I loved you madly and obsessively. No matter what you did to me, I always smiled when facing you. I understood your past, so I was willing to be your sun without needing you to borrow someone else's light."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At that time, I betrayed my grandfather and my three brothers. I even prepared for the worst in my heart. Although I couldn't stay with you till the end, I would accompany you through the hardest path."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't know if I've been hurt too much, but I'm also learning to heal myself. However, it's too hard."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the future, if a girl accidentally falls in love with you, please be more tolerant, because love is sometimes uncontrollable."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You might also be the light in someone else's eyes. When others are in pain, they may see you as their whole world. Show some tolerance, and perhaps their future will be better."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, before Diana passed away, they never gave her such freedom, and things even got worse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Steven was also a pawn of these people. He died too. He was also a poor soul.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled and said, "You said love is uncontrollable. I also told you, it's not that I don't like you, I just didn't dare. Now that things have turned around, I can't control my feelings for you anymore. You said there would always be a way, and you told me to move forward. But if you're not ahead, everything seems meaningless."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana froze, turning her head to look at him in shock. "Oh my God! Steven, since when did I become so important to you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words moved Diana deeply. She just felt her heart soften. After knowing he didn</span><span>'</span><span>t kill her and the child in their past life, her view of him changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled gently. Looking at her shocked face, he realized through the past two days together that her hatred for him was gradually fading. Time would erase the hatred, and some things would slowly grow in the heart with time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His voice was deep and pleasant. "Because you have become a ray of light in my life. Can life go on after the light goes out?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1069.html">« Prev</a><a href="1071.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
