Don't argue with an idiot!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After posting that, Diana watched videos while having night snacks. She took a sip of cold beer and then a bite of fish. She felt so good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah... I feel so good. It's a pity Olivia is not here. If she were here, she could join me in scolding that scumbag."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven returned to the old residence. The housekeeper pleaded for mercy, so he kept her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The housekeeper had taken care of his grandma for many years. He warned her to respect Diana in the future and that if it happened again, he would ask her to get out for real.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The housekeeper said timidly that she would not make the same mistake again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven then turned around and went upstairs to take a shower.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The moment he lay down on the bed, he heard a special prompt tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He picked up his phone, clicked on it, and saw that Diana had posted a tweet with nine pictures. When he saw the caption, he laughed out of anger. "So I was the idiot?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Damn Diana! I was doing that for your own good. Your design drawings are terrific, and if you continue your studies, you'll get better and better in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the thing is, you didn't want to go. Forget it, I'll tell Grandma about it tomorrow morning and have her persuade you. After all, it's dangerous for you to stay in the country.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Marshes are not good people," he wondered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He felt sorry for her taking care of him for two years at her best age, which delayed her studies, so he wanted to send her abroad to study, but she didn't appreciate it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After drinking two cans of beer, Diana felt dizzy, and the anger inside her subsided.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She squinted her eyes and walked unsteadily to the bathroom, brushing her teeth before going to bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was too full and wasn't feeling comfortable lying down, so she held the blanket in her arms and put one foot outside it, which made her feel much more comfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was a dreamless night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana woke up at eight o'clock the next morning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking that Mrs. Helen Gellar still had an acupuncture treatment today, she got up lazily, washed up, changed into an comfortable outfit, and drove to the Gellar family's old residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was already past 9 o'clock when she arrived there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She came in carrying a medicine box. Mrs. Helen Gellar sat on the sofa, looking around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Diana, she quickly stood up and asked with a smile, "Diana, didn't you say you wouldn't go back last night?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The housekeeper at the side looked at Diana nervously and thought, "If Mrs. Helen Gellar finds out, she'll kick me out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This old woman loves Diana the most. I cannot let my son's future be ruined because of Diana!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana glanced at the housekeeper calmly, then looked at Mrs. Helen Gellar and said, "Grandma, I forgot one medicine, so I went back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, okay, come and have breakfast first." Mrs. Helen Gellar took Diana to the dining room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Diana saw that Steven was there too, she walked to the opposite side of him and sat with Mrs. Helen Gellar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, this is the oatmeal you sent me the other day. It tastes really good. I haven't had much of an appetite lately, but I could eat some. You should drink more of this lemonade. It's good for your skin."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled and said, "Okay, Grandma. Your stomach problem is not serious. You just need to take care of it for a while."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana lowered her head to eat and didn't look at Steven at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven looked at Diana silently and wondered, "Didn't you have enough last night? Besides dinner, you had midnight snacks and some beer. And you even scolded me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mrs. Helen Gellar had half a bowl of porridge before she said, "Diana, Steven said that you didn't have time to go to college in the past two years because you took care of him. He wanted to send you abroad to study. I think that's a good idea. The best investment a woman can make is in herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your future will only be better if you become better yourself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana choked on her food and looked at Steven opposite him, thinking, "So you haven't given up yet?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="423.html">« Prev</a><a href="425.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
