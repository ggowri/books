Why would I hurt him? And why would I kill him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at the bodyguard behind him. "Throw her into the sea."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two bodyguards came over and held Queenie on the left and right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was shivering from the cold and had no strength to struggle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Queenie felt helpless and scared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head in fear. "Steven, no, I saved your life before, and please forgive me this time. I really didn't catch Evan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't say anything but looked at the bodyguard. "What are you standing there for? Throw her down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie instantly forgot to cry or struggle and just stared blankly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, she was thrown into the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The freezing cold sea water made her feel like </span><span>she</span><span> was on the verge of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spat out a mouthful of salty seawater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cold seawater left her with no strength to struggle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Steven's ruthless eyes, Queenie was afraid. So, she cried and shouted, "Steven, I...I asked someone to release Evan, and you should ask them to pull me out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven asked indifferently, "Are you sure you want to </span><span>do</span><span> it right away without any nonsense?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie didn't expect him to be so ruthless. "Okay! I won't talk nonsense. Save me, and I'll call them right away and ask them to release Evan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven did this because he had evidence in his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't understand Steven. Before, she seemed to have complete control over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, apart from getting money, she seemed to get nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was a very cunning person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had been working very hard and being very careful in order not to reveal her true colors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven asked the bodyguard to go down. "Pull her out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two bodyguards did not go down but took out the shrinking steel pipe in the car, stretched it, and put it into the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguard said, "Got it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie quickly grabbed the steel pipe, but she was so scared and nervous that her hands hit the pipe so hard that she almost failed to catch it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, her desire to survive made her forget the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact of the sea water was very strong, but Queenie still held on to the steel pipe tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two bodyguards worked together to pull her up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had never been treated like this since she was a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, she was in an extremely miserable state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Speak up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's indifferent voice came from above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook violently, and it was the first time she saw such a terrifying Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I...I want to call...Mario. He knows the other party's phone number."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven handed her the phone and warned her, "Queenie, you'd better tell me the truth. If Evan loses a hair, I will destroy the Marsh family tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie didn't dare anymore. She was very afraid of Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a man who even dared to beat his own father. His childhood was extremely miserable, and she had seen him at his most miserable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie took the phone and dialed Mario's number with trembling hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello! Mr. Gellar..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mario, it's me. Tell them to release Evan," Queenie said, crying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Marsh, what's wrong with you? Did Steven bully you?" Mario's voice was very anxious. "Ms. Marsh, where are you? Why can't I find you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mario, I'm fine. Hurry up and have Evan released, quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Mario heard this, he knew that Steven had discovered what they had done. He was very nervous and scared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was </span><span>ruthless</span><span>, and his methods were extremely cruel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Marsh, I'll call them and </span><span>check out</span><span> first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was praying that Evan had not been thrown into the sea yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But a few minutes passed, and there was still no news from Mario. She was very anxious. Without any news, Evan was most likely thrown into the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beach was 0.6 miles away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan, who was knocked unconscious, was thrown into the sea by two bodyguards.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="864.html">« Prev</a><a href="866.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
