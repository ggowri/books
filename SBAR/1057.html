"Of course. Why not? We can even help the company."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She would never miss any chance to make the company stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie thought only fools like Diana would prioritize family and love, only to end up utterly broken.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had long abandoned everything, and it made her feel even more liberated inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie had once longed for family, but her own parents had betrayed her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had loved, hated, lost, and won, but in the end, she completely surrendered to family and love.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, money was all that mattered. As long as she had it, she could have any man she wanted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From now on, she would focus on living seriously and making money.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had once deeply longed for love, but George had betrayed her too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maybe they didn&rsquo;t love each other enough. She had betrayed George too&mdash;she even carried another man&rsquo;s child.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the past, she had to please the Marsh family during the day and comfort Steven at night.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And then, she had to work overtime alone until dawn.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whether in love or family, Queenie had never received genuine affection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>T</span><span>o walk away unscathed, she stopped hoping for those hollow emotions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she was surrounded by fake love, she would only feel pathetic about herself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Still, she felt a deep sense of guilt and love for Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George pulled out his phone, "Queenie, I'll pick the perfect date. Let's aim for next month to hold the engagement party. With our reputation, we'll definitely grab enough attention."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie agreed. She felt she owed herself to a perfect ending, not wasting the obsession of the past decade.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright! I'll leave everything to you. You know my preferences, and you understand what I want."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Queenie suddenly put down her utensils and looked George straight in the eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"George, final warning. If you betray me, we're done. Completely."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I know you see me as your stepping stone, but love always comes with some self-interest. I get what you're thinking. If you keep messing around with other women after we're engaged, then we won't get married."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back then, she had schemed to snatch Steven away from Diana. After all, Steven was undeniably capable, ruthless in the business world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George stared at Queenie in silence, her words cutting into him like knives, leaving him unbearably uneasy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He decided that she was the only one he would ever marry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, is that really how low you think of me? You're my girlfriend, yet you betrayed me and got pregnant. I let that go. All this time, I've been with you and only you, but you're the one doubting me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He would never tolerate her betrayal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter who was using whom, they absolutely couldn&rsquo;t break up now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Deep down, he still had feelings for Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie gave a calm smile. "I understand. </span><span>N</span><span>ot talk about the past. Let&rsquo;s just live well together."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George finally smiled. "You're right. Go ahead and set up the smear campaign against Diana."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, when Queenie picked up her phone, she noticed the tide of public opinion had shifted. Her face turned ghostly pale in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula had actually recorded a video herself and posted it online to clear up the truth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm sorry to take up public attention, but I have to tell the truth. Dylan called the cops on me because he couldn&rsquo;t find me after I cut ties with him. If he wanted to kill me, why would I let him in?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And also, my daughter Diana never broke up our family. On the contrary, my ex-husband betrayed me. My son </span><span>said</span><span> his father just made the kind of mistake all men make and expected me to turn a blind eye."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm sorry I couldn't tolerate his betrayal, so we got divorced. At that time, my ex-husband chose to cut ties with our four sons, leaving only his illegitimate daughter, Queenie."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana's private life is clean, while Queenie lives recklessly. She had an abortion just last year. Dylan is twisting the truth&mdash;his intentions are malicious."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Also, thank you all for paying attention to this matter. Who's really the scheming girl? Who's the one with a messy private life? Who's the thief? Queenie's scandals were all over the news before. She even drugged me for the inheritance, but I have no proof..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula, with tears streaming down her face, accused herself as the victim, leaving Queenie completely caught off guard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie thought, "Paula actually exposed her own scandals, and now she's trying to drag me down with her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She's absolutely despicable."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Damn Dylan! That useless idiot can't even handle something this simple!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie immediately contacted Mario to handle the situation urgently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Use whatever it takes. Get that news deleted. Find some celebrity scandals to distract everyone. This cannot blow up!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario responded, "Ms. Marsh, the PR team is already on it. Don't worry."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This will turn around soon."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie let out a sigh of relief and said, "Alright. I trust you. Go quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hanging up, she continued to gracefully enjoy her breakfast.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In contrast, after watching Paula's personal clarification video, Dylan realized he had been cast as the abandoned son.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sat in front of his computer, feeling utterly disheartened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Has Dad already signed the disownment agreement?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How is that even possible?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">H</span><span style="font-style: italic;">e only want Queenie?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He grabbed his phone and dialed Gale's number, but it had been blocked. When he tried calling Eric, the call was rejected too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well..." Dylan let out a cold laugh. "She just doesn&rsquo;t want me, huh? Thinks I&rsquo;m stupid, does she? Fine, she can leave me, but did she have to be so ruthless?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan, seething with rage, shot to his feet, nearly knocking the table over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His thigh throbbed faintly with pain, and now everyone was accusing him of being ungrateful. All he wanted was to find his mother. What did he do wrong?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!" Hearing Paula announce the end of their relationship, he furiously smashed the computer to the ground.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You can give up on me! I can still live just fine without you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He grabbed the phone from the couch and called Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hello, Dylan." Queenie's voice sounded calm, almost indifferent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie!" Dylan exclaimed, his voice trembling. "Did you see </span><span>Paula</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s</span><span> </span><span>video? Why would she so reckless? She cares so much about her reputation, why would she air our dirty laundry? Was she threatened?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1056.html">« Prev</a><a href="1058.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
