Don't drag her down! If you want to target someone, come after me. I'm sure your family is completely disappointed in you. You're getting kicked out must not feel too good, does it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You were abandoned by your husband, so you turned to my son to soothe your broken heart." Zoey suddenly spoke out. After all, Queenie was her creditor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Only Queenie could ensure her comfortable life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But the moment she said it, she regretted it. In her panic, what had she just revealed?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana enjoyed watching their expressions change dramatically, feeling immensely satisfied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Oh..." Diana feigned surprise as she looked at the two of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You two know each other? So, you're ganging up on me, huh? First, you bully me, and now you try to twist the facts, saying I was abandoned by my family and my husband. Why don't you ask Queenie why I was abandoned?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Will she admit it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Do you think the police station is owned by your family? Do you really believe the reports on the official site can be faked by the police?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie was speechless. "What's wrong with this old hag? She's usually so sharp-tongued, but today she just can't keep her cool."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie quickly took advantage of the situation. "Diana, this has nothing to do with whether we know each other. It's about your actions and your attitude. You've done so many wrong things, yet you remain so defiant. How can you justify this to your parents who love you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana frowned at her. "Queenie, sorry, but I'm done playing along with your show. Do you even know what it looks like when someone quietly explodes?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With a smirk, Diana pulled out her phone and opened the livestream, grinning. "Today your follower count's about to skyrocket. Everyone loves gossip, right? Let's show them just how 'innocent' this pure little miss really is."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana gave Queenie a quick glance at the video. "Take a look. See how wild you all are? And by the way, I don't even know who Harry is. Me, his woman? With that face that looks like a car wreck? You really think he's worthy of someone as gorgeous as me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The crowd was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">You might be beautiful, but that's just shameless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie's face grew even paler as she realized there was really a video.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She trembled as she took a step back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that moment, the police arrived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"The police are here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The gossip-hungry reporters were stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The gossip-hungry crowd was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They even brought the police into this mess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie, however, oddly felt a sense of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The officer walked up to Zoey, his tone stern. "Mrs. Gall, the evidence against your son is undeniable. Are you really here trying to twist the facts? Do you want us to dig up more crimes your son's committed?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoey froze, feeling helpless because she knew everything her son had done.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But everything her son did, he did for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was disabled and needed expensive treatment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her son, being filial, had just taken a shortcut to make money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The money he made ensured they would live comfortably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">You can't clap with one hand. If those shameless girls hadn't been so cheap, how would they have fallen into her son's trap?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Officer, but wasn't the kidnapping something Diana framed my son for?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The officer frowned at her. "Mrs. Gall, there's video evidence of this. Your son, along with some thugs, cornered Ms. Bishop and her friends in an alley. The whole thing was reported online. Have you ever seen anyone ruin their own reputation to frame someone else?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The officer then turned to the seven reporters. "You've been reported for creating a disturbance. We're bringing you in for investigation. There's also a report that you accepted bribes to come here and slander Ms. Bishop."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The reporters were stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Who did they manage to offend?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">How did they get busted so fast?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie's face went ghostly pale. She had felt relieved when the police arrived,</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">but the officer's words pushed her into an even deeper abyss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It didn't matter, though. Gale was behind this. If anyone were investigated, it'd be him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The police took away the bodyguards and Zoey.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana looked at the video in her hand, realizing it was now useless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She felt a bit of regret. She hadn't yet had the chance to tear off Queenie's disgusting facade.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had to admit, Queenie always seemed to have good luck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, stop this." Steven said as he walked over, blurting out the words.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="144.html">« Prev</a><a href="146.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
