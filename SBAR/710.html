His expression was dark and unreadable.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew him well enough to sense his troubled mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd always been alone, like a child forgotten by the world, wandering in darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She saw through his loneliness, her soft heart deeply touched. She wanted to stay with him, to dispel the gloom and bring him warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't want that.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cold gaze cut through her like a knife, ruthlessly rejecting her efforts.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because she wasn't his angel, she wasn't the one he would open his heart to and willingly embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her deep affection seemed pathetic in the face of his indifference, her companionship worthless in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stubbornly clung to his obsession with his first love, pushing everyone else away, even those who genuinely cared like her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Steven, Diana suddenly broke down in tears, her vision blurring. She knew from the start that this love was doomed to be a tragedy, her devotion only adding to her heartache.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now that Queenie was back, he had grabbed onto his last lifeline, no longer trapped in the abyss of loneliness. Queenie would always be his salvation.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven nervously watched as tears rolled down her face. "Why are you crying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "It's nothing. I just realize how foolish I was back then. You never needed my company. I was just caught up in my own self-indulgent fantasy."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's grip on her wrist tightened slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, that's not true. Back then, I was so grateful to have you by my side. Without your support, I'd still be handicapped, Diana..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop. There's no point talking about this anymore. I'm tired. I need to rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing she was tired, Steven released her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana rushed upstairs, and after closing her bedroom door, she collapsed to the floor, sensing danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she stayed here any longer, she'd fall back into the same trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could control her actions, but she couldn't control her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, no, no. I absolutely can't let myself fall for him again."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Tobias' project had finished, she could leave this place.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until then, she'd avoid seeing Steven as much as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sat on the floor for a long while before finally getting up. She headed to the bathroom for a shower when her phone buzzed in her purse. She checked it, it was Queenie again.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does this woman get physically ill if she doesn't bug me for one day?" Diana thought irritably.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello?" she answered lazily.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie roared through the phone, "Diana, did you tell Steven I'm pregnant with his child?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana replied, "Sure did! Since you're carrying his baby, he should divorce me. I told him to take responsibility for the child.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, your tactics have gotten so amateur. Weren't you the one who had him wrapped around your finger before? Come on, step up your game! Make him divorce me for your unborn child! That would really show what you're capable of."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana grabbed a white nightgown and headed toward the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other end, Queenie was fuming. "Diana, do you really want to leave Steven? If you truly wanted to go, wouldn't you have done it already?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana took a deep breath. "Oh, I want to leave alright, but I literally can't. Even if you got him after I left, you wouldn't see a dime of his fortune. You must know about that agreement by now, right? I only found out recently myself. So right now, that baby is your biggest bargaining chip. Good luck with that, Queenie!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had thrown in the towel.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she entered the bathroom and closed the door, Queenie's voice came through, laced with malicious laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, the day after tomorrow, I've got quite a show planned for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana instantly went on high alert. "What kind of show?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="709.html">« Prev</a><a href="711.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
