She then took off her down jacket and went to her study to work.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before turning on her laptop, she checked the stocks she had bought. Seeing that they continued to soar, she smiled, thinking that she could make a fortune this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the next few years, these were the only few days when she could reap some benefits.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana calmed down, turned on her laptop, and talked about work with Nolan.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She worked until 5 p.m., and when she finished her day's work, she stood up and stretched quickly. Seeing that the snow outside stopped, she suddenly had the idea of making a snowman.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had had a lot at lunch and was not hungry now. After turning off her laptop, she got a pair of snow boots and put them on, went downstairs to put on her down jacket, hat and gloves, and went out to make a snowman.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The snow in the yard was thick, making the skin on her face as shiny as cream.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She found a spacious place and started making snowballs. She often made snowmen when she was a child. After quickly getting the snowballs ready, she found a place and started making a snowman.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, she was slightly dazed as she looked at the snowman she had built. It had a child in its arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even she herself was shocked that the snowman she had made in one breath turned out to be...</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She fell to the ground. "Am I missing my baby?" she wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her beautiful big eyes stared at the snowman blankly, her long eyelashes trembling slightly. The wind was strong. Her flawless skin was faintly pink, and her sexy lips were as delicate and tempting as rose petals.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the evening, the sun shone through the clouds, and rays of sunlight fell on the earth and also on her delicate face like a halo. She looked just amazing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat in the snow for a long time until night fell. She then got up and went back to cook, in a sorry state.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was alone tonight. She wanted to have spaghetti, so she took four shrimps out of the refrigerator, put them in water to thaw, washed some cabbage, cut them into shreds, and made herself a bowl of seafood spaghetti.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she still felt unhappy after the meal. It might be because the snowman she had made unintentionally reminded her of the unborn child she had in her previous life, and she felt uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back upstairs, she stared out the window in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven, on the other hand, was also absent-minded at the banquet.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He checked his phone and saw no message from Diana. He couldn't help but laugh at himself. He was actually expecting her to send him a message.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, he was certain that she couldn't live without him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, however, though she was living under the same roof with him, he felt that there was a great distance between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat alone by the window, looking out with a cold look, and no one would dare to approach him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Yvette walked up to him fearlessly and sat opposite him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was wearing a pink tight skirt. She really had a good figure, and her every move was full of charm. The other men looked at her and were completely mesmerized by her. Her slightly swaying waist looked so soft.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a sip of the red wine in her glass, then smiled and said, "Mr. Gellar, we meet again."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven remained unmoved. He just glanced at her calmly without saying anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just that indifferent glance from him that made Yvette suddenly stop breathing and her heart skipped a beat. "Steven is so charming," she thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled and apologized, "Mr. Gellar, I'm sorry. I was reckless about what happened at noon. Can you forgive me?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="752.html">« Prev</a><a href="754.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
