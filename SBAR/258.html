She despised having her life dissected by strangers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, there was nothing to be done about these bored souls.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana mumbled, "Is Frank taking out his anger on me for Queenie's sake?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank adored Queenie, yearning to shower her with every good thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her past life, Diana had envied their bond. Now, she awaited Frank's demise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank had perished at sea, a place he cherished. The woman he pursued was his death warrant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he returned, it would mean he had won her back, all orchestrated by Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking of the kind-hearted Paige, Diana felt a pang of helplessness. Why did kindness always invite pain?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, you've got issues," she muttered to herself. The timeline had shifted, but destiny remained unaltered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's path remained unaltered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Deciding to take a roundabout route home, Diana declined Alexander's offer to escort her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her troubles shouldn't drag him into this mess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The paparazzi, halted by Alexander's bodyguards, could only watch her leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A few steps later, her phone rang with an unfamiliar number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hesitated, not wanting to answer, fearing it might be someone she had blocked. But the insistent ringing persisted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hello?" she finally answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, where are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The voice on the other end was unmistakably Steven's. Diana was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He recalled she rarely called her; over the years, she had been the one to reach out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why should it matter to you where I am? Didn't I tell you before? Only contact me for divorce matters."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven fell silent for a moment before speaking, "Stay away from Alexander."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His tone held an emotion she couldn't place, and she didn't bother to guess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why the sudden concern for me, Steven? Are you just playing games? Enjoying what you have while eyeing more? Don't be so shameless. How long will it take to finalize our divorce?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana couldn't fathom why Steven resisted going to finalize their divorce.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She contemplated asking Leopold to send bodyguards to drag Steven there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, you're still my wife," Steven asserted with emotions she couldn't decipher.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Diana made the decision to move on, she stopped the endless game of trying to decipher the enigma that was Steven's mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whenever he furrowed his brow in the past, a pang of self-doubt would strike her. She would search for some misstep on her part that might have cast a shadow over his mood once more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Living a life tiptoeing around every possibility had draped her in a cloak of melancholy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana laughed. "Mr. Gellar, are you feeling alright? You were the one who threw a tantrum and publicly tossed the divorce papers at me. Now you're clinging to me like this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's call it quits, Steven. If we don't, things are just gonna get awkward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't cry or cause a scene. I even helped you and Queenie. That's more than enough face-saving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let me be clear: for work-related matters, speak to my assistant. Unless it's about the divorce, don't call me again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Diana blocked Steven's number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Steven tried to call back, he found himself blocked again and again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the dimly lit corridor, his gaze was as murky as his thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Entering the private room, he looked at Evan and ordered, "Find out who's behind this trending search."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="257.html">« Prev</a><a href="259.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
