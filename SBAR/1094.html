"Sir, we received a report," he said sternly. "You need to come with us to the station for questioning. Your actions have already violated the law. Stop resisting immediately and cooperate with the investigation."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan smirked and gestured toward the vast office space, his attitude dripping with arrogance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Officer, can't you see everything here belongs to my family?" he sneered. "How could taking my own stuff be illegal?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan was furious, convinced that Eric was behind all of this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had already taken photos of the trade secrets and planned to hand them over to Queenie tonight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I will be the CEO of the Barnes Group. No doubt about it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The officer said firmly, "Sir, please calm down. We're just doing our job according to the law. If there's been a misunderstanding, our investigation will clear your name."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan knew exactly what his actions meant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Eric was convinced he stole the trade secrets for Queenie, he</span><span>'</span><span>d definitely end up in jail.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan scoffed, "This company belongs to my family. I work overtime here, and you</span><span>'</span><span>re accusing me of stealing trade secrets? Where</span><span>'</span><span>s your proof?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The officer said, "We received a video report. It shows the entire process of you stealing the company's secrets."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan thought, "Damn it, Eric's been suspicious of me all along. He even set up surveillance in his office."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Impossible. I absolutely didn</span><span>'</span><span>t steal any trade secrets. I went to my brother</span><span>'</span><span>s office. He has the files I needed. I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t steal anything."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dylan, whether you stole company secrets or not, the police just need to check your phone," Eric's cold voice cut through. "Who did you send the confidential files to?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan snapped his head toward Eric. Eric seemed more composed, more calculating now, staring at him with an icy gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan wondered in confusion, "Is this still the Eric I remember?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric seemed to have grown up. He used to be frivolous, avoiding work, spending all day in his room doing whatever he liked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Eric had changed drastically. He stood tall, his gaze deep and sharp, exuding a calm confidence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Realizing it, Dylan thought bitterly, "Mom would rather invest in Eric than in me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Eric, you're shameless. You set me up."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric stood in front of him and said firmly, "Dylan, it was Queenie who set you up. You know everything she</span><span>'</span><span>s done, yet you let her. And now, you want your friends to hurt Diana."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie ruined our family, and yet you</span><span>'</span><span>re willing to help her. You</span><span>'</span><span>d even destroy the Barnes Group, handing over trade secrets to Queenie."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You</span><span>'</span><span>re not fit to inherit the Barnes family business. Mom</span><span>'</span><span>s here, but she doesn</span><span>'</span><span>t want to see you. She set up a trust fund for you. After you get out of prison, you</span><span>'</span><span>ll live off that."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?" Dylan couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t believe Paula would do this to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "No, no way. Mom loves me. I don</span><span>'</span><span>t believe she</span><span>'</span><span>d do this to me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Where</span><span>'</span><span>s Mom? I want to see her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric said painfully, "Dylan, you chose to trust Queenie, so now you have to face the consequences."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan shook his head in disbelief. "This is all Diana</span><span>'</span><span>s fault. She</span><span>'</span><span>s the one trying to take Steven</span><span>'</span><span>s company. I just wanted to get it back for them. I did nothing wrong."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric frowned at him and said, "Didn</span><span>'</span><span>t you watch the livestream earlier?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan asked, confused, "What livestream?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Last night was Dylan's friend's birthday party. He didn</span><span>'</span><span>t get home until late and slept in until just now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment he woke up, he got a call from Queenie. She said tonight was the perfect time for him to steal the company secrets.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric knew it was Dylan's friend's birthday last night and figured he must have had a lot to drink.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric said, "Dylan, Diana didn</span><span>'</span><span>t steal Steven</span><span>'</span><span>s company at all. If you</span><span>'</span><span>d watched today</span><span>'</span><span>s livestream, you</span><span>'</span><span>d know there</span><span>'</span><span>s a man who looks exactly like Steven. That</span><span>'</span><span>s Queenie</span><span>'</span><span>s husband, George."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, from the start, the ones trying to take over the Gellar Group were you guys."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Impossible." Dylan refused to believe his judgment was wrong.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 5.15pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A hush fell over the room.</span><span> </span><span>The air thickened with unspoken tension&mdash;every face a carefully schooled mask of calm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 5.15pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Except Dylan's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric pulled up the livestream recording and said, "Look. There are two Stevens who look exactly the same. Queenie</span><span>'</span><span>s husband, George, has already been arrested. You</span><span>'</span><span>ve been used by them all along. If I let you go tonight, you</span><span>'</span><span>ll end up dead."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dylan, the Barnes family was saved thanks to Diana</span><span>'</span><span>s warning. Deep down, you know everything. You just don</span><span>'</span><span>t want to face it because you once bullied her in the cruelest way."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You</span><span>'</span><span>d rather team up with Queenie than face the mistakes you made in the past."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric's words forced Dylan to confront the truth he least wanted to face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan could barely stand, his heart racing. He stared at Eric, trembling slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stared at Eric and said, "Eric, why didn</span><span>'</span><span>t you tell me the truth earlier? Why did you have to push me to this point? Isn</span><span>'</span><span>t it because you just want the company all to yourself?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric frowned at him, disappointment written all over his face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric said, "Dylan, don</span><span>'</span><span>t you get it? Survival of the fittest&mdash;that</span><span>'</span><span>s the law of the jungle. The strong control their fate, the weak just get trampled."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Have you closed a single deal while you</span><span>'</span><span>ve been out partying?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if we handed you the Barnes Group, how long could you keep it afloat? The Barnes Group barely survives in this brutal arena. Mom trained us to be strong, to push forward, so we could survive in this cutthroat business world."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In just a few short months, Eric had tasted the harshness of the business world and finally understood how much Paula had endured all these years.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was a businessman, always prioritizing profits and the livelihoods of his employees.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan felt like he was suffocating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking about what he had just done, his chest ached, and he struggled to breathe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After losing his family and home, driven by impulse and selfish desire, he chose to follow Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan shook his head. Though he regretted it, he still held his ground. "Eric, I</span><span>'</span><span>m trying too. I was just blinded, that</span><span>'</span><span>s all. Do you really want to see me go to prison?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1093.html">« Prev</a><a href="1095.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
