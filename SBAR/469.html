Can I take you to dinner tonight?" Joseph asked, his tone slightly cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana replied, "Joseph, I have plans tonight. How about tomorrow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure! Tomorrow night it is. What do you like to eat?" Joseph said, his tone shifting to excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought momentarily before replying, "Let's try Capitole's specialties. I know a restaurant near the hospital. I'll come find you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph beamed with </span><span>joy</span><span>. "Great! I'll text you the address tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sounds good!" Diana replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After ending the call, she felt Steven's intense gaze and heard him say coldly, "So it's the guy from the hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah! Mr. Gellar, after leaving you, I realized there are plenty of good guys out there," Diana said, deliberately provoking his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, Steven's expression darkened further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stifled a laugh, barely holding it in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, karma kicked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at Evan and barked, "Evan, pull over and let her out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan stopped the car but quickly remembered they were on the highway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were heading west for a meeting, so they had taken the highway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked around and realized Steven was serious about kicking her out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She scoffed, her tone bitter, "Mr. Gellar, this is the second time you've dumped me on the highway. I really hate you, and I don't want to see you again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's heart sank. He opened his mouth to respond, but Diana had already flung the door open and jumped out, slamming it shut behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recalled the last time Queenie had called him about a stomachache, and he had dropped Diana off halfway, not even paying attention to where they were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't gone back that night and had no idea how Diana managed to get home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven clenched his fists. He had been kind to Queenie because she had saved him many times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, they were all her lies. He should have treated Diana better, but every encounter seemed to end in conflict.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could say anything, Evan drove off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, Evan! Who told you to drive? Go back and get Diana!" Steven shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan replied, "Mr. Gellar, Ms. Bishop isn't walking forward; she's going the other way. She must have seen the highway exit. She'll catch a taxi soon enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Last time you left Ms. Bishop on the highway for Ms. Marsh, she had to walk for two hours to get home. Her phone was in the car, and she couldn't reach anyone. Meanwhile, you rushed off to the hospital with Ms. Marsh."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And it turned out Ms. Bishop just had menstrual cramps. If you had taken a little longer, she wouldn't have had to go to hospital," Evan teased lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan felt sympathy for Diana, thinking it was unfortunate she had to deal with a guy like Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's expression darkened. "So you didn't remind me earlier and just stopped on purpose?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan shook his head. "Mr. Gellar, I wouldn't dare. I'm just following your orders."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven narrowed his eyes and said, "Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced back at the highway, but the traffic was heavy, and he could no longer see Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Damn it. She really knows how to push my buttons. She brought this on herself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fuming, Steven closed his eyes to regain his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Diana got out of the car, she saw an exit not far ahead and felt a wave of relief. This time, she wouldn't have to walk </span><span>for </span><span>two hours; she could be off the highway in about 20 minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she walked, tears streamed down her face, and her heart still ached at memories of the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as she approached the bridge, she noticed a car behind her speeding up. Panic surged through her as she turned around and saw a car barreling toward her.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="468.html">« Prev</a><a href="470.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
