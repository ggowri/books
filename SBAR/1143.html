"Mr. Gellar, let's exchange contact info so we can discuss cooperation in the future."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at Zach's cheeky smile and said coldly, "Move!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zach trembled all over, breaking into a cold sweat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was even scarier than the legends.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He mustered up his courage and said with a smile, "Mr. Gellar, don't be mad. I've wanted to meet you for a long time. Let's sit over there; it's still early."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zach kept blocking Steven and Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt very hot and itchy inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This feeling was very off.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought she might have suddenly fallen ill.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, I'm so hot. Let's leave quickly. Take me to the hospital. I feel really uncomfortable," Diana said in a sweet voice, looking charming.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked down at her. Her forehead was covered in sweat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was very familiar with this scene. At some parties he had attended before, women who took aphrodisiacs seemed to be in a similar state.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at the three men in front and said coldly, "Move aside! Or your companies will all go bankrupt tomorrow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three men were startled. The legendary Steven, cold and ruthless, was indeed as rumored.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were a bit scared, but after exchanging glances, they all felt somewhat unwilling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another man saw that Diana could barely stand and reached out with a smile to support her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, who is this lady? She doesn't seem to be feeling well."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before his hand could touch Diana, Steven kicked him away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How dare you touch my wife."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven is very possessive of Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man kicked to the ground felt pain all over his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven almost took his life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man pointed at Steven with his finger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You... you're so cruel. I'm in so much pain." The man fainted in agony.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other two men, afraid to stop the furious Steven, quickly stepped back a few paces, watching him warily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven supported Diana as they walked downstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie saw that the three men didn't stop Steven and Diana, frowned angrily, quickly walked over, and gave Mario, who was not far away, a signal with her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven and Diana have both taken aphrodisiacs; separating them is a piece of cake.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario understood instantly and quickly walked over with two men.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie blocked Steven's path, pretending to look worriedly at the uncomfortable Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, what's going on? Diana looks uncomfortable. Need help? Let me take you to the hotel to rest first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said unhappily, "It's you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie had no idea why he would think it was her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie pretended to be puzzled and said, "Steven, what do you mean? What about me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "Queenie, did you drug Diana?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie didn't dare to admit it; the consequences would be unimaginable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She sneered and said, "Steven, there are hundreds of people here. Why do you say it was me? Do you have any evidence?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You have no evidence, so don't accuse me recklessly. I wouldn't do such a thing. Maybe Diana was trying to seduce someone."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie looked mockingly at the distressed Diana, feeling delighted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stood straight, holding Diana tightly in his arms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Those three men didn't stop me earlier, and now you're taking action yourself. Queenie, I originally planned to let you stay a bit longer. Since you started this, I won't forgive you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was about to explain when Steven suddenly lifted his foot and kicked her hard in the abdomen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The intense pain made Queenie scream, drawing everyone's attention.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not far away, Alexander felt helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was truly glad he hadn't collaborated with Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie." Mario quickly walked over and held the unconscious Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was knocked unconscious by Steven's kick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, what did you do?" Mario nervously picked Queenie up, glaring angrily at Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said coldly, "You two are really bold."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at Diana in pain, held her, and left. At this moment, no one dared to stop him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan had already brought bodyguards up to block those people.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander could only watch helplessly as Steven took the unconscious Diana away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was rushed to the hospital by Mario.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After getting in the car, Steven looked at Evan and said, "Take us home first, then investigate the mastermind behind tonight's events."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Investigate Queenie first, and then the banquet staff."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tonight's events were clearly planned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They knew Diana liked cake and put the drug in it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The cake was strawberry-flavored, so Diana couldn't notice anything unusual.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan said, "Alright, Mr. Gellar. I'll take you home first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan looked at the drowsy Diana and softly asked, "Mr. Gellar, you should be gentle."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven held Diana protectively and said, "Shut up!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan laughed. They could finally be a real couple tonight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan hoped they could be happy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt very hot. Steven just had a couple of bites of cake and also felt unwell.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was clear-headed at this moment. She gazed at Steven with a dazed look.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said in a seductive voice, "Steven, how much longer until we get to the hospital? I feel so uncomfortable."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She started taking off her clothes, tearing at them nonstop. She just wanted to find a cool place, but Steven beside her was also very hot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven held her tightly, softly comforting her, "Diana, hold on a little longer. We'll be home soon. You won't feel hot in a bit."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan said, "Mr. Gellar, Mrs. Gellar is not conscious. How about we go to the hospital? I'm afraid she'll be angry when she wakes up tomorrow morning."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said coldly, "She went to the hospital last time. Now she has me, and you want me to go to the hospital?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, he was going to exercise his rights as Diana's husband.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1142.html">« Prev</a><a href="1144.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
