She said she had an important person to take care of and would not accept any invitation from any company for the time being.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've always admired her talent. So I did what she asked. But there was something wrong back then. Ms. Bishop used a pen name, not her real name. Aside from me and her teachers, not many people knew about it. When you came to me, I didn't realize who you were referring to."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven frowned and thought, "What a lousy excuse!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The principal smiled and continued to explain, "Mr. Gellar, I only found out some time ago that the best student that year was Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I learned the truth because her works appeared."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's expression looked much better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you, Mr. Wilson!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven hung up the phone with mixed feelings. "Diana had to take care of an important person back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That person was me, who had a car accident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The fire didn't kill me, and a terrible car accident followed, which almost left me disabled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana took care of me for two years, while Queenie did nothing for me and received a monthly allowance of 5 million dollars from me instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How on earth had I managed to ignore the sincerity of Diana who had taken care of me 24 hours a day for the past two years?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I credited Queenie with an illusory life-saving grace while humiliating Diana and making things difficult for her in every way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The fire was suspicious, and Queenie was nearby. Why did Queenie and her father insist that it was Queenie who saved me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that time, Diana had not yet returned to the Marsh family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From another perspective, Jeff seems to have known who Diana was all along.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But later, Diana was suddenly brought home. What's the purpose of that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Marsh family seems to have some secret I don't know about.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What is it?" Steven wondered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He frowned, and his face clouded over with anger. He never expected that one day he would be fooled by a scheming woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The man behind Queenie is indeed powerful, and no clues can be found," Steven thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stood near the window, his deep eyes reflected the distant light.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He lowered his eyelids, his thick eyelashes hiding all his expressions. With a high nose bridge, he pursed his lips tightly, as if thinking about something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was giving Mrs. Helen Gellar an acupuncture treatment in a private room on the second floor. After inserting the needles, she whispered, "Grandma, I want to tell you something. Don't be too shocked."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mrs. Helen Gellar cooperated with Diana and laughed softly. "Diana, I've been through a lot of ups and downs, and I can handle anything at my age, you know. Just say it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana took out her phone and played a recording.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mrs. Helen Gellar's face changed drastically at the recording.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="425.html">« Prev</a><a href="427.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
