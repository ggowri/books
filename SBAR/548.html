Without money, she couldn't even afford to give birth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since she met Gale, her life had been quite affluent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale gave her expensive gifts, and the allowance he provided was more than she could spend. Because of his doting, she became quite extravagant with her spending.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every month after receiving the money, she would go to the bar and spend wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few thousand </span><span>dollars</span><span> per night, 50,000 dollars actually didn't last very long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for Gale's misfortune, she could have spent at least 200,000 </span><span>dollars</span><span> a month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" She gritted her teeth, but without money from Queenie, she didn't dare to do anything because she really killed that woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want to go to jail, but...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Althea, she prayed that it was best if what she carried wasn't Gale's child; she needed to clear all obstacles for her son on his path to becoming the Marsh family heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the Marsh family could tolerate Queenie without any limits, Paula could also tolerate Penelope to the same degree for the sake of the child in her womb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie couldn't stop her either. She didn't need money, but she wanted to return to the Marsh family to carry out her pregnancy. As long as she colluded with Queenie, she could still get through the current crisis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze was fierce. Gale is a perfect shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That idiot Paula should at least care about her grandson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope had an idea and was just waiting for the right moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Diana came over with baby formula, it indicated that the child in Althea's womb was about to be born.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that Althea's child was very likely to be Gale's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, she had plotted to have sex with Gale, but instead, Althea was pulled in by Gale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale, out of guilt towards Penelope, spoke ill of Althea, leading Althea to leave him completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Althea regarded that fool, Gale, as a treasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope gave a cold smile, turned around, and left, planning to blackmail Althea, whom she considered both wealthy and foolish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana and Althea were completely unaware of what had happened outside. When they returned to the room, Althea had already prepared lunch, waiting for Diana to come and eat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, Diana, let's eat the fish. This fish has no bones at all and is super fresh. And these conch meats, the ones you picked up from the seabed last time, I processed them on the same day and put them in the refrigerator; they are still very fresh," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sat opposite her and nodded happily. "Okay! I'm so hungry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was eating the tender and fragrant fish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's so tasty." She smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea was also very glad, but her lower back was sore and swollen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew her baby was about to be born.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, my baby is about to be born, I'm so excited, really looking forward to it." The joy in her voice was uncontrollable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter who the father was, this was her child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana watched her with excitement, knowing that no matter who the father was, Althea truly loved this child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her previous life, Althea never ended up with Gale. She raised the child alone, and when the child was five years old, she met someone who truly loved her. Diana did not know who that man was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea lived a happy life later, but Diana never saw her again in her previous life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm also looking forward to it. A new life is a symbol of hope, Althea, you will be happier." In this life, she would watch over Althea's happiness. Althea is a wonderful girl; Gale didn't deserve her.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="547.html">« Prev</a><a href="549.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
