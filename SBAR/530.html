"Mario, say something! Didn't you say you had everything set up?" She was on the verge of breaking down. She couldn't understand why her every single plan was unraveling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling deeply guilty, Mario looked at the enraged Queenie and mumbled, "Ms. Marsh, I did arrange everything. Could Cecil somehow catch wind of the report against him and switch out the suppliers in advance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way. This was done in complete secrecy. How could he possibly know?" Queenie refused to believe Cecil could have known. She had only made the arrangements the night before. Even Wyatt had been in the dark about her plans. So, it was impossible for Cecil to get wind of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario lowered his eyes, trying to figure out where things had gone wrong. Every step had been so careful that nothing should have slipped out. He thought, "That cocky Cecil, for a pampered playboy, he sure is hard to take down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario said, "Ms. Marsh, I'll contact the CEO of Henson Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie raised her hand, stopping Mario. Her gaze was cold and calculating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on. We can't risk exposing ourselves or inviting trouble. The Farley Group is under investigation, and the Henson Group will certainly be under the spotlight for a while. Let's wait. Wyatt should have his son back by now, and then we can find out what really happened."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario said, "But, Ms. Marsh, we've invested in Mr. Wyatt Farley's project. Now that it's turned into a mess, our whole investment might just go up in smoke." He thought, "This really backfired. Karma came around fast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie froze, nearly forgetting about the investment herself. She thought, "No, I can't let this happen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold off on the 200 million dollars for Paula," Queenie commanded. "We need to keep our cash flow safe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, Mario struggled to speak. "Ms. Marsh, that money was already transferred this morning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Queenie's gaze turned icy. Only then did she remember that she'd been in a good mood earlier and had told Mario to send the money to Paula, hoping it would keep her quiet and prevent her from causing any more trouble that could damage Queenie's reputation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Transferring two hundred million dollars out of the company was risky. Queenie knew she'd be looking at serious jail time if Paula got serious about pressing charges. After all, she wasn't Paula's biological daughter, and if Paula's company went under, this transfer would certainly come to light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! All this fuss over a mere two hundred million dollars. Paula really had to push it." But what infuriated Queenie even more was the failure of today's plan. She couldn't find a single excuse to justify why it had gone wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie stared coldly at the computer screen for a long moment, then said in a raspy voice, "Mario, have Felicity and the others start the acquisition of Paula's company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to leave Paula with nothing. She wanted Diana to spend her life in misery, unloved and uncared for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario frowned, a cold glint flashing in his eyes. "Felicity and her team are planning to continue the acquisition talks today. I'll immediately investigate this matter with Cecil and see what went wrong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine. Get to the bottom of it so we can put our minds at ease." Queenie wearily waved Mario off. She sat on the sofa, and for once, her usual proud demeanor showed a hint of exhaustion. Since Diana had woken up at her party, things had gone downhill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the past, everything Queenie touched went smoothly. Even Steven used to come running at her slightest beck and call.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="529.html">« Prev</a><a href="531.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
