Looking at his son's little red face, which looked very much like him when he was a child, he smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was this the feeling of being connected by blood? Sam felt so warm and happy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at him with a silly smile and teased him, "Your wife doesn't even let you hold the child, where does your current sense of happiness come from? A man without a sense of boundaries really doesn't deserve happiness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, his smile froze. He pressed his lips, and after a while, Sam explained, "Carolyn misunderstood. I'm not that kind of person, and I didn't have any ambiguity with Janet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought of the evidence Carolyn had given him and reminded him, "Since you believe so much in your innocence, why don't you check your wife's phone? Maybe someone is secretly trying to sow discord between you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like a woman like Queenie, she had no bottom line and would do anything to achieve her goals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She kept provoking Diana, so Diana was quite experienced in this kind of thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam thought about it and looked for Carolyn's cell phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to look for it, the car door opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet's voice suddenly came. "Sam, the car in front is moving, and we can take Carolyn to the hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam </span><span>stopped to check the phone</span><span> </span><span>and</span><span> looked at Janet. "You go back first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, Sam, I want to go to the hospital with you, and I want to take care of her." She must not let Carolyn talk nonsense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't be driven away, and she wanted the entire Young family to be hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam's eyes were indifferent. "Janet, Carolyn wants to divorce me because of you, and I will investigate this matter. Don't disturb her, and she needs to rest now. If you still have some feelings for the Young family, then </span><span>just </span><span>go back</span><span> now</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... Sam, don't listen to what Carolyn said. I didn't do anything, and it was Carolyn who framed me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She argued anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam closed the car door and ignored her nonsense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He got back in the cab and drove to the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car in front moved, so Diana breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet stomped her feet in anger, and only when the driver behind her honked did she reluctantly leave the road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Carolyn woke up, Janet would be in danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She must not let her have the chance to tell those things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stopped a car on the roadside and went to the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana took out his cell phone and called Nolan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, Paige is fine, and her hands are gradually regaining feeling. How are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said, "</span><span>That</span><span>'</span><span>s great</span><span>. I'm fine here, too. Both of them are safe. Please take care of Paige, and I'll accompany this lady to the hospital</span><span> first</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, Luna </span><span>is gone</span><span>. Ask someone to look for her. Something might have happened to her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan explained, "Diana, Luna </span><span>just </span><span>called me and said she was fine, but Evan was in trouble. He seemed to have been taken away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was surprised. "Was Evan taken away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan continued, "Luna said so, and I have sent someone to help her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana replied, "Okay! Keep an eye on the situation over there and call me if anything happens."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hung up the phone, very surprised. How could Evan be taken away?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's car had already reached the beach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened the car door and pulled Queenie out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the winter, by the sea, the wind was roaring like a wild horse, and the cold wind was like sharp needles piercing people's cheeks, bringing them pain like a knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was shivering with cold, and she was very scared as she saw Steven's ruthless handsome face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven...Steven, what are you going to do? Are you really going to throw me into the sea?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven glanced sideways; his eyes were bloodthirsty, and he sneered, "Queenie, I'll give you two minutes to </span><span>tell them to</span><span> release Evan. Otherwise, you will be buried with him in the sea."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cold voice was like a sharp knife, piercing her body deeply. Not sure if it was because of the cold or the real pain, Queenie couldn't stop shaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Evan had already been killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could only deny it and not let Steven know that it was her </span><span>plan to</span><span> </span><span>take</span><span> Evan away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, please believe me. Why would I kidnap Evan? He and I have no grudges against each other, so why would I kidnap him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie tried to make Steven believe her words.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="863.html">« Prev</a><a href="865.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
