"No, Grandpa, I just miss you! Hehe... No one dares to bully me. I'm quite capable, you know. And don't worry about anything happening here. I've got it all under control. I won't let you down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Besides, I'm really rich now," she added with a playful grin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She silently vowed never to disappoint her grandfather again. This time, she would also ensure her three brothers were safe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She understood that Queenie would surely retaliate like a cornered animal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula's recent actions had driven her to desperation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana also knew this was a race against time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She couldn't give Queenie any chance to regroup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the moment, Queenie's main adversary was Zion. And Zion was no pushover.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was going to be a fierce battle between the two. Diana found herself looking forward to seeing who would emerge victorious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Leopold chuckled warmly. "Alright, sweet pea. But remember to stay safe. I'll finish up my business here as quickly as I can and come back to you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No one will ever dare lay a finger on my granddaughter."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled. "Well... Thanks, Grandpa. Bye!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After hanging up, she felt a lot better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She realized that family was the greatest comfort of all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking back on Queenie's accusations, she began to suspect that she had wronged Steven over the stolen designs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It hadn't occurred to her before that Queenie might have stolen the designs from her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven had vehemently denied the accusation back then, but she hadn't believed him. Now, she realized she had made him experience the bitterness of not being trusted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Still, she didn't dwell on Steven. He was probably somewhere receiving treatment by now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Turning her attention to her computer, she focused on analyzing the stock market. The recent market trends weren't great, and after some time, she closed the laptop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She picked up her phone and started scrolling through the day's news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The headlines were filled with stories about Queenie, accompanied by a deluge of criticism.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One glance at the box office numbers for Queenie's movie told her everything she needed to know. It had already been pulled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She chuckled softly. This was exactly the outcome she had hoped for.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That man had lost everything Steven had built. Back in the country, his hands were tied, and nothing came as easily as it had abroad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His plan to elevate Queenie's stardom for a quick rise to power had completely collapsed after Paula's public stunt. Their dreams had shattered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a thoughtful pause, Diana sent a message to Luna.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Luna, last March, I did a paternity test at Curave Hospital. I need you to investigate the doctors there and find out if anyone received a large sum of money around that time.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna, seeing the message, walked straight into Diana's office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, what are you trying to investigate? Why were you doing a paternity test?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a brief hesitation, Diana decided to reveal the truth. "Luna, Jeff isn't my biological father."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna's eyes widened. Then, a moment later, she broke into a grin. "Diana, that's amazing news! I hope your real father turns out to be someone who loves you deeply."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana let out a bitter laugh. "I've been stressing about this all morning. Someone tampered with the results to keep me from finding out the truth. I need to know who. Help me investigate. I've sent you the hospital address and the date of the test."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna nodded firmly. "Alright, Diana. There's nothing pressing this afternoon, so I'll head out to investigate now. I'll have Joseph bring up your lunch."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana gave a small nod. "Thanks! Go ahead."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With Nolan already back at the main office, it was just the two of them here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Luna left, Diana immersed herself in her work once more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Queenie had returned to her company, but an even bigger problem awaited her. Zion was there, waiting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew her acting career was over. The inevitable clash with Zion was about to happen. But she had prepared for this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she stepped into the office, she was greeted by Zion's furious glare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes were icy cold, his frustration palpable. He had thought he had discovered a rare gem, but Queenie had brought him nothing but disappointment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despair gripped him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, the production was set to start in just a few days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, at this critical juncture, Queenie's scandal had exploded, leading to her universal rejection online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie, just look at the mess you've created! You haven't even started shooting your first drama under our contract, and you're already embroiled in these scandals. How am I supposed to salvage this? You'll have to pay an enormous penalty for breaching the contract."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The oppressive atmosphere in the office felt suffocating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie, already fuming and heartbroken, responded with a mocking smile as she faced Zion's anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Zion, I know I'm finished. There's no point hiding anything from you now. You're not exactly a saint yourself. I've done my research. Quite a few actresses under your name have mysteriously disappeared, not to mention some children tied to you who've gone missing. I won't be paying a dime in penalties. Dream on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Zion's face darkened, shock flickering across his features. He hadn't expected her to uncover these secrets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't fathom how she had found out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Striding forward, he revealed his true, sinister nature, his gaze sharp and menacing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He slapped Queenie hard across the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Zion had never been a good man. Once their relationship soured, his cruelty quickly surfaced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The slap left Queenie dizzy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mario, standing nearby, immediately intervened, kicking Zion to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though Zion fell, he wasn't hurt. Looking up at Mario, he gave a cold, dismissive smirk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie, you're done for. Those accusations of yours are baseless. If you dare spread any lies, you'd better watch your back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie smirked coldly, her eyes flashing with murderous intent. At this moment, she appeared more demonic than Zion himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Zion, do you really think you can outmatch me? Even if I leave the entertainment industry, I have significant influence and power in the business world. You may be a successful agent, but it's easy to pull someone like you off their pedestal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I wasn't coming after you, but now that you've come to me, I'll make sure everything you've done is exposed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Zion froze, momentarily speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her laughter was chilling, like something straight from the depths of hell, sending shivers down his spine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though Zion was known for his ruthlessness, he faltered at the sound of Queenie's voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing the flicker of fear and disbelief in his eyes, Queenie felt triumphant. Against someone like Zion, she needed to be even more vicious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Zion, I've already called the police. The moment you contacted me, I knew what you were planning. You wanted me to pay a massive penalty. Well, I'll make sure your entire company becomes mine instead."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This had been her plan for months.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had gathered plenty of dirt on Zion and prepared meticulously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Zion's eyes widened in disbelief. "Queenie, how did you find out all of this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was terrified. No one had ever uncovered his secrets before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The evidence lay in his office, locked away in a safe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The safe-held records of his organ trafficking operations and illicit earnings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie, seeing the shock in his eyes, chuckled softly. Tilting her head, she teased, "Mr. Swift, why don't you take a wild guess?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="986.html">« Prev</a><a href="988.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
