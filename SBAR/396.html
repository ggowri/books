Wearing a floral shirt, beach pants, and flip-flops, he looked like a scoundrel.&#8203;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He tilted his head and grinned at Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man said in a frivolous tone, "You have no right to refuse. You are as gorgeous as angels. There have never been beauties like you on our island. The sea behind you is very pretty. Come and play with us. The beach is very soft."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, he reached out to pull Diana, and his gaze disgusted her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#8203;She seized his hand and dragged him violently forward, causing him to lose his balance and fall awkwardly to the ground.&#8203;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had been holding back her rage. At that moment, her eyes were icy, fierce, and sharp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She growled, "You're courting death!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man banged his teeth against a stone. In an instant, the blood gushed from his mouth. He couldn't help but scream and roll in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#8203;Paige sensed a cold aura emanating from Diana and found her strange yet amazing and strong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shot a hostile glare at the other three men. "Do you still want to play with us?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her calm tone sent chills down their backs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They stepped back and stared at their leader lying in agony on the ground and then at Diana, not daring to act rashly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her movements showed her great fighting skills.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though striking, she was so cruel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man in the white T-shirt fixed his eyes on Diana and Paige and felt reluctant to give up such beautiful girls.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He licked his lips obscenely, squinted his eyes, and shook his hair. "Miss, I think I still want to play with you. I haven't slept with women as striking as you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at the other two men beside him and said, "Let's catch them. They are just two women. We are grown men and can definitely handle them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana asked Paige to move back. "Paige, stand under the tree and wait for me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#8203;She was afraid Paige would get hurt when the fight broke out.&#8203;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She would defeat them in two minutes at most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige didn't know how to fight. She was just an innocent girl. Even a one-mile walk could leave her sore for three days.&#8203;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She took a step back obediently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other three men besieged Diana together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was well-trained. Each of her attacks was ferocious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She punched the man on the left in the face, and he touched his cheek and wailed in agony.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man in front of her was hit in the crotch. He covered it with his hands, in too much pain even to scream.&#8203;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Diana could make a move, the other man was kicked from behind and collapsed in front of her in the most embarrassed posture.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She glanced up and saw Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stood tall and straight and appeared even more remarkable in the moonlight. He exuded a frightening aura and gazed deeply at Diana.&#8203;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It turned out that she was also good at fighting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven glared at the man beside her, who was still in so much pain that he couldn't make a sound. His gasps were disgusting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a frown, Steven approached Diana, locked eyes with her, and warned, "Next time you get into a fight with a man, don't kick him in the crotch. It's dirty!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought, "You are dirty, too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She blinked and wondered why Steven was here.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="395.html">« Prev</a><a href="397.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
