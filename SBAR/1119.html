If I</span><span>'</span><span>d known he didn</span><span>'</span><span>t care about living, I shouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t have saved him back then."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's thoughts were written all over her face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven chuckled and asked, "Diana, are you regretting saving me back then?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at him, thinking, "How does he always know what I'm thinking? It</span><span>'</span><span>s just a thought. When it comes down to it, I could never just stand by and watch someone die."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Let</span><span>'</span><span>s head inside. I want to know the truth."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana and Steven walked into the house together.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, Steven, you're back," Helen said. She had just returned from a trip, looking much more refreshed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They knew the dangers at Capitole, so to keep Steven from being threatened, they all left the country.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had personally mentored Steven and were well aware of his capabilities.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was far from useless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whatever he set his mind to, he would accomplish.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And when faced with rivals, he showed no mercy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled and called out, "We're back!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two walked in and greeted the elders warmly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven still held a grudge against Andrew and Jenny, so he ignored them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew and Jenny felt a bit hurt, but seeing the family in such a good place now, they were already content.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone enjoyed dinner, chatting and laughing together.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After dinner, everyone moved to the living room. The servants brought out fruit and coffee, then quietly left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold glanced at Diana beside him. She had gained some weight recently, thanks to Steven's care. This made Leopold genuinely happy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana noticed Leopold smiling nonstop and teased, "Grandpa, you</span><span>'</span><span>ve already got so many wrinkles. Stop smiling so much!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold huffed, "That</span><span>'</span><span>s all your fault. Back then, you only cared about Steven, leaving me to run the company. No wonder I aged so fast!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sighed helplessly as Leopold brought up her past actions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grandpa, I</span><span>'</span><span>m sorry! I promise I</span><span>'</span><span>ll be good and listen from now on."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She truly felt regretful about it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold was quite pleased with her current attitude.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glanced around at everyone before breaking the silence. "Grandpa, how do you know Edward and Helen? I never knew you were acquainted!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edward, Helen, and Leopold exchanged knowing smiles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edward chuckled and said, "Leopold, why don't you explain what</span><span>'</span><span>s been going on all these years? Let them rest early and give us great-grandchildren sooner."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt utterly helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold looked at her, smiling as he pulled out a document. Handing it to Diana, he said, "Diana, this is a paternity test report for you and your father."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stared at Leopold in shock. "Grandpa, do you even know what you're saying? My father!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Could Grandpa know who my biological father is?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana tensed up, her entire body rigid as she silently watched Leopold.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold spoke firmly, "Diana, have you never considered that I might be your real grandfather?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was equally shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana turned to Tobias, who sat there calmly. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tobias, why aren't you shocked?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias chuckled, "Diana, we've always known who you are. You're Grandpa's biological granddaughter."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at Leopold, her eyes red with emotion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Grandpa, then why didn't you tell me the truth all these years?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold replied, "If I told you the truth, would we still be sitting here chatting like this? Do you remember how you grew up? You and your siblings were raised in secret on that island. If I revealed your identity, you wouldn't have had the carefree life you do now. I just wanted you to enjoy a few more years of freedom."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold had hoped to find him an ally, but Steven turned out to be completely unreliable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For a moment, he truly considered replacing Steven with Alexander, but something about Alexander just felt off.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana scoffed, "I still grew up under the same sun on that island, didn</span><span>'</span><span>t I?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana understood exactly what Leopold meant, but the revelation left her completely stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold explained, "Your father was drugged back then, left with no choice, and crossed paths with Paula. At the time, she was being set up over a business deal until she met your father. She became the antidote he needed. Afterward, he gave her a sum of money to resolve her business crisis."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He never thought she'd get pregnant, but she did. Your dad happened to run into Paula at the hospital, and sure enough, she was expecting."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then you were born. Your dad suspected you might be his daughter. He couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t step forward himself, so he sent me to handle it. I took his sample and ran a paternity test with yours."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I was shocked, overwhelmed with excitement. You</span><span>'</span><span>re my granddaughter."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I ran the paternity test multiple times. You are, without a doubt, my granddaughter."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I planned to find Paula, negotiate terms, and take you away."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But something unexpected happened. When I went to see Paula, I caught Jeff secretly swapping the two babies."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I followed him myself. He took you to the countryside. I pretended to run into him by chance and convinced him to let me raise you. That</span><span>'</span><span>s how, to the Marsh family, you became the girl who grew up in the countryside."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Later, to keep Paula from suspecting anything, I bought land there and built a house."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I secretly sent you to the island and hired top-notch tutors to teach you various skills."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jeff's actions played right into my hands, so I never went back to Paula."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I truly believed that growing up by my side would make you happier than any other girl."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But I was wrong. Growing up by my side, you had no mom or dad."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then Edward suddenly came to me. He knew what happened back then. We've been close friends since we were young, so I didn't hide it from him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I wanted to bring you home then, but Steven was at his lowest, burying himself in work and taking care of the Marsh family. He was such a disappointment to me."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1118.html">« Prev</a><a href="1120.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
