Leopold noticed her gifts and found different teachers to educate her in various disciplines.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven, still curious, asked, "And your medical skills? When did you start learning those?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled confidently, "Around the age of six. I was more interested in medicine and research. When I was six, there was a heavy snowfall like this, and I got really sick. The doctor gave me medicine, and I felt much better the next day. It seemed almost magical to me, so I told my grandfather I wanted to learn medicine, and he found the best doctors to teach me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she talked about her past, Diana's face shone with pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven asked again, "But when Gale came to get you, why were you in the countryside?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana explained, "Isn't it obvious? I bought a mountain there specifically to grow the medicinal herbs I needed. Did you think the unusual remedies for your leg injury could just be bought at the market?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your eyes were able to recover because of the herbs from that mountain&mdash;they were all rare plants."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was slightly taken aback. "So, the cool and strong-smelling medicine you applied to my eyes every day came from there? But you said..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back then, because I was young and nobody believed me, not even you&mdash;you all thought I was stealing the happiness Queenie deserved. So, I told your grandmother I had found a doctor to treat you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana calmly explained while driving. In this life, she chose to keep nothing hidden.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want to continue suppressing her true self or allowing others to take credit for what she had done.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt she could not stay silent about her achievements while letting Queenie take the credit.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sometimes, I think all of you were really foolish. You were biased from the start, and I was always the passive one, yet all the blame fell on me. That's why I insist on getting a divorce. The rift between us is filled with too many unhealed wounds."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was trying to communicate openly with Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had no intention of getting revenge on him; that would only happen if she had a death wish.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven couldn't find any justification to refute what she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him fall silent, Diana spoke with a casual air, "Steven, from now on, I refuse to let myself be betrayed again.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you should just step back gracefully and live happily ever after with Queenie."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven saw how genuinely happy and carefree she appeared, and it made him feel she had truly moved on.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remained silent, his expression darkening.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as the car pulled up to the Farley Manor, his face took on an even darker shade. "Diana, did you really rush out in the middle of the night just to see Cecil?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded. "Yes! Madam Farley told me Cecil had a nightmare and was terrified, so she asked me to come check on him."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was left speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were filled with anger as he thought, "Cecil, a grown man, is scared of a nightmare?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How can I believe that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana opened the car door and got out, with Steven quickly following her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they entered the villa, Cecil's frantic shouting filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was startled by the intensity of his voice. She had no idea what was going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madam Farley, what's wrong with Cecil?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rita, her face wet with tears, shook her head. "Diana, I don't know what's happening. He suddenly woke up in the middle of the night, screaming and shouting. I begged him to open the door, but he wouldn't, and he kept demanding to see you."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="666.html">« Prev</a><a href="668.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
