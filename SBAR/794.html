She&#x27;s just using me. If we get back together, it would definitely drive her crazy, don&#x27;t you think?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana&#x27;s eyes widened in surprise. &quot;Steven, when did you figure this out?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The revelation caught her off guard.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She couldn&#x27;t believe that he had seen through Queenie&#x27;s schemes.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Although she didn&#x27;t fully trust him, the idea of getting under Queenie&#x27;s skin was enticing.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Getting back at her does sound satisfying, but I&#x27;m not keen on stepping into your mess. For my own sake, I think I&#x27;ll pass on the partnership.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She was wary of teaming up with him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">If he decided to side with Queenie again, she could end up in serious trouble.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You don&#x27;t trust me?&quot; His voice turned serious, frustration evident.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana held his gaze firmly. &quot;Why should I? If you&#x27;re looking for revenge against Queenie, just say so. No need to beat around the bush.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;And if Amelie finds out what happened tonight, it&#x27;ll look like you sold me out.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven was exasperated. It seemed she would never let her guard down.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Trust me this time. I&#x27;ll stand by you, no more disappointments. As your husband, I&#x27;m committed to believing in you.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana felt a jolt of unease at his words. Something felt off.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;No, that&#x27;s not necessary. I can handle my own issues. If you want something, just say it directly. I&#x27;m not playing your games anymore. You&#x27;ve used those tricks too often, forcing me to apologize or taking things I care about. If you want something, just ask. No more schemes.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her expression turned pale, the anxiety clear in her eyes.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She was genuinely afraid of Steven&#x27;s intentions and knew she wasn&#x27;t ready to confront him just yet.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Waiting for a better moment felt safer.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He studied her, recognizing her reluctance to trust him. It hurt more than he expected to see her so distant.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After a moment of silence, he took a deep breath, feeling an ache in his chest.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I&#x27;m going to the restroom. Think over my proposal while I&#x27;m gone. I hope you&#x27;ll give me a clear answer when I get back.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He rose, his posture tall, and headed toward the restroom, leaving Diana lost in thought.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She couldn&#x27;t muster the energy to consider his offer. The longer it took, the more she sensed he would become relentless. Anyone who crossed his path didn&#x27;t end up well.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It puzzled her how he had transformed so completely.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In her last life, he was already married to Queenie. Why was he still being so malicious?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie was a master manipulator, fooling everyone to become the richest woman in Capitole.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But this time, luck wasn&#x27;t on her side. She had parents who dragged her down.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Despite her cruel nature, Queenie was truly devoted to her parents. She was willing to sacrifice having a loving mother like Paula just to ensure her mother could be recognized as Jeff&#x27;s legitimate wife and to avoid being labeled as an illegitimate child.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was tragic that she had never known the warmth of a mother, never experienced the love that came with it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Returning to Paula, she had always been deprived of maternal affection.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="793.html">« Prev</a><a href="795.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
