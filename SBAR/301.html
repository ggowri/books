In less than six months, the Foliot family would surely fall into Queenie&#x27;s hands.</p><p>Queenie reached her current status, all because Steven had gradually nurtured her rise.</p><p>Diana wrapped her arms around herself. She had only herself. When she felt sad, she could only hug herself for comfort.</p><p>She couldn&#x27;t drag her grandfather and brother into this filthy mess.</p><p>The Azure Group was her ultimate fallback.</p><p>Diana lay on her desk, feeling miserable.</p><p>&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Diana was lost in her thoughts and hadn&#x27;t noticed someone entering.</p><p>She muttered, &quot;I&#x27;m thinking about how to get a divorce.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Diana, do you really want a divorce that badly?&quot; a cold voice sounded, making Diana sit up straight abruptly.</p><p>Seeing it was Steven, standing tall with a deep, cold gaze, Diana scoffed. &quot;Steven, aren&#x27;t you the one who wants the divorce? Doesn&#x27;t it feel hypocritical to question me like this?&quot;</p><p>&quot;We won&#x27;t divorce. I&#x27;ll wait for you to calm down. Once you&#x27;re over it, you&#x27;ll come back,&quot; Steven said coolly, his voice devoid of warmth.</p><p>Diana finally asked, &quot;How did you get in here?&quot;</p><p>Steven sat on the nearby sofa, elegantly crossing his long legs. &quot;Luna let me in. I told her I was here to discuss the divorce, so she didn&#x27;t stop me.&quot;</p><p>The bastard knew how to use people to his advantage.</p><p>Diana thought for a moment. &quot;Isn&#x27;t that exactly how scumbags operate? Use everything to their advantage.&quot;</p><p>As Diana was thinking, her phone on the desk rang.</p><p>She picked it up and saw it was Alexander.</p><p>&quot;Alexander,&quot; she answered.</p><p>As soon as she called him &quot;Alexander,&quot; Steven&#x27;s face darkened.</p><p>Since she left, there were new men around her.</p><p>Each one came from a better family background and was more handsome than the last.</p><p>&quot;Diana, I just had someone check. Jace offered Frank some projects as a peace offering. He&#x27;s got a few promising artists under his wing, and Frank managed to secure those investments, keeping the company afloat.&quot;</p><p>Diana was a bit surprised that Jace would go to such lengths for Queenie.</p><p>&quot;Alexander, don&#x27;t worry. I&#x27;m fine. You don&#x27;t need to be concerned about me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Alright! Just letting you know. If you need any help, call me,&quot; Alexander replied.</p><p>&quot;Okay, if I need anything, I won&#x27;t hesitate to ask. Thank you!&quot; Diana said, smiling as she ended the call.</p><p>Steven frowned and asked, &quot;Diana, you&#x27;d rather seek help from other men than from me?&quot;</p><p>Diana laughed bitterly at his words. &quot;Steven, don&#x27;t you feel ashamed? Have you ever helped me once in all these years I was with you?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="300.html">« Prev</a><a href="302.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
