Their relationship had grown more distant.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He looked down at the bowl in his hand and smiled as he cleaned the dishes.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Washing dishes was not a difficult task for him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Ten minutes later, he had cleaned all the bowls and utensils. He even wiped the stove until it was spotless.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Looking around the kitchen, he felt satisfied with his work.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven didn&#x27;t like strangers in his home. Even his friends rarely entered his personal space. But in Diana&#x27;s home, he felt happy.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After drying his hands, Steven prepared to go upstairs to find Diana.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Just as he reached the stairs, his phone rang.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He glanced at the screen. It was his irresponsible father calling.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A mocking smile appeared at the corner of his lips.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He had bottled up his anger for a while, but now he couldn&#x27;t keep it in.</p><p style="text-align:left;">To Andrew, his illegitimate child was always more important.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Hello?&quot; Steven answered the phone.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Steven, the woman you love most is Queenie. She&#x27;s in the hospital. Why aren&#x27;t you there with her?&quot; Andrew demanded.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven remained calm. &quot;If you care so much, you can go take care of her. Even if she saved my life back then, I&#x27;ve already repaid that debt over the years. I&#x27;m not interested in her anymore.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;What do you mean by that? How can you be so ungrateful? Queenie saved your life. How can you say such heartless words? Get to the hospital and take care of her right now,&quot; Andrew snapped.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven moved the phone away from his ear, waiting for Andrew&#x27;s tirade to end.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Then he brought the phone back to his ear.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He said, &quot;Queenie just aborted Levi&#x27;s child. You should go find Levi. After all, those two are in love.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;What?&quot; Andrew was shocked.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven sneered the hung up the phone.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He couldn&#x27;t let himself be the one suffering and being taken advantage of all the time.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was time for them to fight among themselves.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie had been too impatient. She couldn&#x27;t control herself, and her plan to manipulate him had failed.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her companionship with him wasn&#x27;t genuine.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her real goal was to kill him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven had tolerated Queenie for his own purposes.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Now that he knew the truth, he wouldn&#x27;t waste any more time on her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven looked upstairs. The woman up there was the one he should cherish.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He sent a message to his bodyguard, instructing the latter to keep an eye on Queenie. Then, with graceful steps, he walked upstairs.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana had gone upstairs earlier to take a bath. After her shower, she quickly dried her hair and lay down on the bed to sleep.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Having stayed awake all night, she was so tired that her steps were unsteady.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As soon as she lay on the bed, hugging a pillow, she fell asleep almost instantly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">When Steven came out of another bathroom, he quietly pushed the door open.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Hearing her steady breathing, he smiled. He slipped under the blanket, held her in his arms, and closed his eyes to sleep.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He wasn&#x27;t afraid of being caught. After all, they were legally married.</p><p style="text-align:left;">*****</p><p style="text-align:left;">At the hospital, Queenie was lost in her thoughts.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She was plotting how to use Steven again.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She was so focused that she didn&#x27;t notice Andrew storming in.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He barked, &quot;Queenie!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie was startled and frowned at him, not knowing what was going on.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Andrew, why are you here?&quot; Queenie asked.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Andrew walked up to her and slapped her across the face.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie was enraged. &quot;Andrew, why did you hit me? I haven&#x27;t bothered you recently.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You shameless woman! Queenie, have you fallen so low? Will you die without a man? How dare you betray George and get pregnant with Levi&#x27;s child?&quot; Andrew trembled with rage.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie was shocked that he had found out.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Who told you that?&quot; she demanded.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Steven,&quot; Andrew said, his face filled with disappointment.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;What? How could it be him?&quot; Queenie couldn&#x27;t believe it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven didn&#x27;t want her anymore.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She didn&#x27;t know how to fix it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">If Steven discovered her involvement in the fire and the car accident, he would make her suffer.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Andrew snapped, &quot;Queenie, you&#x27;ve ruined everything. I told you to seduce Steven and kill him quietly so that George could take his place without anyone knowing.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;But look at what you&#x27;ve done. You&#x27;ve wasted all your chances. You didn&#x27;t even gain anything from Paula&#x27;s company.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I warned you before to live as you used to. Paula and your brothers would ensure Steven cherished you.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Even as an illegitimate daughter, you could have had a good life. But you had to mess everything up. You&#x27;ve ruined my plans of more than ten years.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie laughed, &quot;I&#x27;ve endured everything for you and George for over ten years. But has anyone ever cared about me?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I&#x27;ve sacrificed so much for your plans, but I have my own life too. I don&#x27;t want to be an illegitimate daughter. I want to be the rightful daughter of the Marsh family.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;What&#x27;s wrong with wanting my own life? What&#x27;s wrong with having my dreams? You and George have always hidden in the shadows while I fought at the forefront. And now you dare to blame me?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She felt helpless.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She wanted success. She wanted to rise above others.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She wanted to be admired by everyone as a powerful woman. She had worked so hard and had no reason to give up.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You...&quot; Andrew was furious. &quot;Queenie, don&#x27;t forget where your company came from. George truly loves you. Why would you betray him and have another man&#x27;s child?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Andrew could accept George&#x27;s indulgent lifestyle, but his daughter-in-law had to be a proper and virtuous wife.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie had always seemed gentle and well-behaved, at least on the surface. He hadn&#x27;t opposed George&#x27;s relationship with her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She had even agreed to sacrifice herself and get close to Steven to help George.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But her actions were infuriating.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie sulked, &quot;Levi raped me. That night, he was drunk and overpowered me. We were filming together at the time. I didn&#x27;t tell anyone about it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Andrew, you know how things are in this industry. Some things are beyond my control.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie shed tears of grievance. Everything had gone according to her plan, and it seemed like she had gotten what she wanted, but in reality, she had gained nothing at all.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Andrew frowned. &quot;He forced you?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="879.html">« Prev</a><a href="881.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
