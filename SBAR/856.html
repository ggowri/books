Queenie was extremely embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly explained, "Steven, I don't want to expose our relationship. Don't forget that the movie you invested in hasn't been released yet. If you say we have nothing to do with each other, you will definitely lose money after the movie is on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven sneered, "Do you think I care about that little money?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie shuddered. She heard that he had made a lot of money in the stock market some time ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never been short of money, but now, he was unwilling to spend a penny on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven suddenly took a step back and said coldly, "Queenie, I told you before that I have never been a good man. I'll get back at you in the same way you tricked me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You locked Paige here for forty minutes, and you should stay here for that long."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Queenie was horrified. How could he know? "No. Steven, I didn't. I really didn't."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was very scared. Staying here for 40 minutes would cause her to freeze to death.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, I will die of frost. Please let me off. Paige's kidnapping has nothing to do with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was frightened because she couldn't fight against nature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being at 50 degrees Fahrenheit below zero for 40 minutes would really kill her.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, Paige must have frozen to death. Queenie even arranged for someone to stop the ambulance, believing that a good-for-nothing like Paige deserved to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was upset at the sight of Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Steven was going too far, leaving her here to freeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gazing at him, who was indifferent, Queenie crawled over to beg him in fright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was dressed in heavy stockings, but the uneven floor still hurt her knees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The extremely low temperature made her shiver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was so chilly. Paige should have been dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie tugged at Steven's trouser leg, glanced up at him, and pleaded pitifully, "Steven, you can't be so cruel to me. I am your beloved one. Can you bear to let me suffer in the cold here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a quick step back and gazed down at her. "Queenie, I warned you, but you didn't listen. Paige stayed here for forty minutes, and so should you. It is tit for tat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven pivoted around and locked the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took out his cell phone and called Evan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna's voice came from the other end, which stunned Steven slightly. "Luna, why is it you? Where is Evan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She replied anxiously, "Evan is in trouble. I'm chasing after him. Don't call me if there is nothing important. Don't bother me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned. Luna had a hot temper, but he could also tell from her tone that she didn't trust him from the bottom of her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Evan is my assistant. Something happened to him. I should go to save him. Where are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna was furious. "I'm going to hang up. It's too late for you to come over now. Goodbye."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She ended the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at his cell phone. No wonder he couldn't get through to Evan. It turned out that he was in danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly opened Evan's dialog box. Something happened to Evan after he sent him a message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given his personality, Evan would have come to find him by then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he texted him probably because he had noticed something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Evan could only tell him the truth of the matter by sending a message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was discovered and then taken away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's grip on the phone tightened slightly. He pivoted around abruptly and heard Queenie knocking on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, please let me out. I did nothing wrong. I didn't do anything. You can't lock me here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a strong murderous intent in Steven's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Queenie's men who had caught Evan.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="855.html">« Prev</a><a href="857.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
