Bang! Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, loud, aggressive banging erupted at the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Queenie and George flinched, startled by the sudden noise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's gut told her it had to be Jace Foliot's goons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That old fox must've woken up, and she knew exactly how he'd play his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's eyes glinted with a dangerous determination as she grabbed her phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd done her homework on Jace. Every secret, every ally&mdash;she had it all mapped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew he had shady connections, and if cornered, he'd lash out like a wounded animal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, here they were, right on cue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After rattling off her address to the dispatcher, she ended the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she dialed Jace directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected, the line barely rang before he picked up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You conniving witch, Queenie! You tricked me, gave me that filthy disease, and now you think you can steal my company? Over my dead body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calling me now to beg? Ha! You're too late. I'll make sure you wish you were never born!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jace's voice was thick with rage and overconfidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought this was a call of plea from Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pff!" Queenie couldn't hold it in and let out a chuckle, light and sharp like a knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell are you laughing at?" Jace's tone turned suspicious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, Jace, you sad, sad man," she purred, her voice dripping with mock pity. "Did you really think I'd let you get the upper hand? Your eldest son? He's going to jail. And guess who turned him in? Your own darling daughter-in-law.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've burned every bridge, Jace. Your nephews? They'd rather see your company in pieces than lift a finger to save it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You never planted a single seed, but now you want shade? Pathetic. Sending a pack of meatheads to scare me? That's your grand plan?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All you're doing is digging your own grave faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And let's not forget your youngest son&mdash;he's next. Both your boys locked up, your illegitimate brats useless as ever. When the dust settles, guess who'll be holding all the cards?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From the moment I saved your granddaughter to get closer to you, I had you in the palm of my hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even sweet little Novia, who's the least useful, probably skipped town by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Surprised, Jace? Oh, I bet you are." Her voice was like honey laced with arsenic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jace sputtered, his fury almost choking him. "You... Queenie, you&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't get too worked up," Queenie cut in smoothly. "Wouldn't want you stroking out before the main event. Stick around. You're about to hear your youngest boy get hauled off in cuffs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her laugh was low and full of menace, like a wolf savoring its prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You wouldn't dare!" Jace roared, his voice cracking under the weight of his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie glanced at the door and said into the phone, her tone mockingly fearful, "Jace, don't hang up just yet. I want you to hear your son getting arrested with your own ears. Hear that banging? Oh no, I'm so scared!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, if you dare&mdash;" Jace's voice cracked with fury. "I'll make you wish you were never born!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His breathing grew ragged, and each inhale labored as he fought to keep his rage from overwhelming him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smirked, a spark of satisfaction in her eyes. Turning to George, she said with calm assurance, "George, head to the bedroom and wait for me. I'll handle the rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George hesitated, concern etched across his face. "Queenie..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trust me. A few bruises? Small price to pay," she said with a wink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George gave the door one last wary glance, its hinges rattling under the relentless pounding, then nodded. "Be careful," he murmured before retreating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie turned back to the door, placing her phone strategically on the windowsill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jace, pay close attention. You're about to lose your son and everything you hold dear. And remember all those lessons about patience and timing you taught me? They're coming back to bite you. And it will be painful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jace's voice exploded on the other end. "Queenie, you're a damn snake!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She ignored him and she saw the message: [the police were seconds away.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her grin was small but razor-sharp. Jace's little underworld empire was about to crumble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she was about to be rewarded for helping root it out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang! Bang! Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The apartment door groaned, hanging on by a thread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's expression tightened, her gaze fixed on the entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Crack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door splintered open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dozen men poured in, leather jackets gleaming and faces set in sneers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading them was Liam Foliot, Jace's youngest son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want? Who are you?" Queenie shrieked, her voice high and panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam's eyes burned with hatred. "You destroyed my family, Queenie! Tonight, it's your turn to pay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie stumbled back, her eyes wide and filled with fear. "No, stay back! I don't know who you are!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam paused, his brows knitting together as doubt flickered across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cut the crap!" he snapped, motioning to his men. "End this now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gestured to his men, about to end this as quick as they could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You all, get in there and strip her down. I'm going to make her wish she was never born," Liam snarled, his voice thick with venom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dozen men moved forward, their physiques towering and muscular, each one more imposing than the last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie pressed her lips together, her eyes cold. These men were all from the underworld&mdash;broad-shouldered, with strength that could break walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was mentally keeping track of the time; the cops should be on this floor any minute now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't... don't come any closer!" she shouted, her voice quivering with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She kept stepping back, not daring to retreat into the room, standing her ground at the doorway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help... somebody, please help!" Queenie screamed, her voice breaking with desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men froze for a second, clearly unnerved by her terrified wails.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But their anger flared, and the two men in front moved in fast, grabbing her with force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They yanked her clothes off without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah... help, please someone save me!" Queenie cried out, her struggles growing frantic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Smack!" One of the men fed up with her shrieks and slapped her across the face with a resounding crack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bright red handprint instantly appeared on her cheek, swelling up quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..." Queenie cried out, the sting from the slap shooting through her head. She knew things would get rough, but she hadn't imagined it would be this violent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her ears rang, and the taste of blood in her mouth made her stomach turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahem... Ahem..." The pain was so intense that tears welled up in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These bastards were brutal&mdash;there was no mercy here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sudden chill ran through her body as one of the men leaned in, kissing her with no restraint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn, she's soft and smells good," he muttered, marveling at her smooth, glowing skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, two other men held her arms tightly, pinning her in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie writhed, her body straining against their grip. She hissed, "Get off me! Don't touch me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the men loosened his belt, a wicked grin spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lifted Queenie and spread her legs, ready to thrust himself in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then&mdash; "Bang!" A gunshot shattered the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Freeze! Police! Hands where I can see them!" a commanding voice boomed.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="928.html">« Prev</a><a href="930.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
