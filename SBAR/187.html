He bent down, carefully wrapping her up, and directed the officers to carry Cecil back to the city.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">On the way back, Steven drove Diana and Cecil to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna and Evan accompanied them to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil slumped weakly, angrily grumbling, "Diana, the drug's effect is too strong. I still don't have any strength left."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was just as drained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It won't wear off until tomorrow morning. I'm sorry I dragged you into this tonight. I was prepared, but I still ended up putting you through this," she apologized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil let out a bitter laugh, his charming face softened by a hint of warmth. "Diana, why are you apologizing? You got targeted because you came to save me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana chuckled. "I promised Grandma that I'd get you out safely. I knew you'd be set up, so I had someone follow you. That's how I got the evidence I needed. I hope you're not mad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I care about Grandma. She's lived an honorable life. If anything happened to you, she'd be devastated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Last time, her trust in me kept Queenie from succeeding in her scheme. I did what I did out of gratitude, and I hope you won't be upset."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Silly, I'm not mad. I'm grateful," Cecil tried to reach out to her but lacked the strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven sat in the driver's seat, listening to their conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His eyes were filled with anger. No wonder the surveillance at his bar was destroyed, yet Diana presented video evidence proving Cecil's innocence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">So, she had someone secretly tailing Cecil.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven glanced at Diana through the rearview mirror, meeting her cold stare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven furrowed his brows. Her gaze was colder than he'd ever seen before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What she had said earlier was clearly meant for him to hear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There's a saying, 'stirring the grass to scare the snake.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven shook his head. His past distrust of her was rooted in what he had seen himself, combined with his dislike for her, which had allowed him to let Queenie bully her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had hurt her deeply, and he couldn't understand why he had been so foolish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">On the way, both Diana and Cecil couldn't hold on and fell asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie had been waiting for news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She loved standing by the window, gazing at the bustling villa district. It was the only way she could feel a sense of superiority.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, her phone vibrated. Queenie quickly picked it up, her eyes lighting up with delight when she saw the caller ID.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"How did it go?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Ms. Marsh, it didn't go as planned. Diana was rescued and taken to the hospital. Our people got caught, and the video shows Cecil was there too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie was furious. "What? Who told you to mess with that lunatic?" Fear flickered in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil was a relentless bastard who never let things slide.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Ms. Marsh, they didn't recognize Cecil. Diana had dinner with him tonight, and both were drugged as soon as they stepped out. They were kidnapped together. Don't worry, Chaos League won't betray a client, and even if Diana suspects us, she has no evidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"While Cecil was detained, we managed to steal one of his deals. Ms. Marsh, can we make up for our failure with this?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="186.html">« Prev</a><a href="188.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
