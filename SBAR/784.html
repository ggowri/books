Even when angry, he spoke to her in a cold, distant tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had rarely seen him this upset.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I truly don't understand you," she said, observing his darkened features. "You told me not to cling to you, so I didn't. I followed your wishes and divorced you. Now you suddenly don't want the divorce? I've never met someone so fickle."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eyes flickered, caught off guard by her question. He wanted to admit he had misjudged Queenie and that he had loved the wrong person.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't understand love and thought that being nice to Queenie was love.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Diana's leaving that made him understand what love was.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn't just walk away, leaving him ensnared in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're silent again," she pressed. "What does my life plan have to do with you? Why are you so angry?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was angry too; he had ruined her good mood yesterday, and now today.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt so unfair!</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, I'm just out to unwind and spend time with friends. Why do you always have to show up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was clearly annoyed, deeply frustrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, if I didn't appear, you'd be happy mingling with those guys?" Steven's gaze bore into her, serious and intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought there was nothing wrong with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meeting like-minded people could lead to exchanges and learning. Why did he see it as something sinister?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not as pathetic as you think! Did I ever interfere when you were with Queenie? You even let her send you those photos to annoy me&mdash;did I ever scold you for it?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because you don't love me, I didn't tell you about those photos or Queenie's taunts. You two have become increasingly outrageous, and I had to bring it into the open."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, she turned her back on him, deciding that the best punishment was to ignore him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven sighed helplessly. He had explained the photos with Queenie countless times, but she refused to believe him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never been intimate with her!</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling helpless, he stated firmly, "I've already answered that question. I've never touched her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven felt that he was wronged.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Diana didn't trust his words; to her, Steven was simply a scoundrel who denied responsibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh!" she sighed deeply. "Steven, this is exhausting. Aren't you tired of living like this? Poor Queenie, how did she end up with such a terrible man like you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clenched his fists, unsure of how to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While she was tired of love, his feelings were just beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled her to her feet. Startled by his roughness, Diana looked up at him, wide-eyed. "What are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the fear in her eyes, he suddenly felt playful.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What am I doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was low and teasing, dripping with ambiguity.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you're my wife." His intense gaze held hers, commanding and assertive.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes flashed with panic. "S-So what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you've never sleep with me. How about tonight?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="783.html">« Prev</a><a href="785.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
