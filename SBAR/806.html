I&#x27;ve admitted my mistakes and said I want to make it right, but you never give me a chance...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I don&#x27;t want anything from you. All I want is a divorce. I&#x27;ve told you countless times that my future won&#x27;t include you, so please let me go.&quot; Diana met his bloodshot gaze, genuinely frightened that he might act on his anger.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She wasn&#x27;t trying to save herself for anyone in particular, but she wanted to be with someone she truly connected with. Only then would she willingly give herself to him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Seeing her fear tugged at Steven&#x27;s heart, but he didn&#x27;t want to let her off the hook so easily.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He gently traced the delicate lines of her face with his fingers.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He couldn&#x27;t understand how he had once been so indifferent to such beauty.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Diana, you&#x27;re so beautiful. Did you know that? I find it adorable when you get angry and lash out.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">His warm fingers grazed her cheek, and she swallowed nervously, finding it odd to hear such words from him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Y-You... please move your hand away. This is making me uncomfortable.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He was pressing too hard, making it difficult for her to breathe.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven eased back slightly, giving her some space.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Then, without hesitation, he leaned down and kissed her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The kiss quickly deepened. Her soft lips ignited a desire in him that he couldn&#x27;t resist.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana struggled, turning her head away to escape him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven, worried about hurting her, reluctantly released her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">With tears brimming in her eyes, Diana looked at him and asked, &quot;Steven, do you even know what it means to respect someone?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He flinched slightly at her words.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She pressed on, &quot;You&#x27;ve always acted without regard for me. You never respected my feelings or asked whether I was okay with any of this.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Why do you always assume everything? Why do you do whatever you want?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana was furious. Just thinking about him kissing Queenie made her feel sick.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She knew she was being unreasonable, but it hurt her to know he had kissed another woman before coming to her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Seeing him step back slightly, she pushed him forcefully and glared at him. &quot;Steven, wasn&#x27;t Queenie enough for you? You&#x27;re such a jerk!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She wiped her mouth, disgust written all over her face.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven felt a mix of anger and helplessness. He realized he needed to confront that man to clear his name.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Standing up, he declared, &quot;You should go take a shower. I&#x27;ll sleep here tonight.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Absolutely not!&quot; Diana vehemently opposed it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven turned to face her. &quot;Diana, you are my wife. Don&#x27;t forget your role, and I am your husband. From now on, I will fulfill my responsibilities.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana opened her mouth, confusion filling her eyes.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His words startled her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It felt like he had changed completely in just a few days, making her even more anxious.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Taking a deep breath, she sat on the bed, summoning her courage. &quot;Steven, if you have some grand plan, just say it outright. There&#x27;s no need for all this. Just tell me what you&#x27;re really after.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven frowned, incredulous. He chuckled lightly, shrugging off his suit jacket and tossing it aside. &quot;Diana, what are you thinking? I just want to be a good husband. I&#x27;ve been narrow-minded, thinking of you as just a girl from the countryside, overlooking your brilliance. I kept you by my side for two years, letting disappointment build until you wanted to leave. Now I realize my mistakes and just want to make things right.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Don&#x27;t think of me that way.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He turned and walked toward the bathroom, a crack forming in his previously composed facade.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As Diana watched him leave, her voice was eerily calm. &quot;Steven, I don&#x27;t want your compensation. Those two years were spent willingly by your side. You don&#x27;t need to do anything for me because I know exactly what I want. You can never trap me unless I choose to stay.&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="805.html">« Prev</a><a href="807.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
