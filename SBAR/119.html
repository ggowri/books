They will never betray you because you are not their real master.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Also, these men are trafficking children and women to work as prostitutes in underground casinos. If these things are discovered, they will all be blamed on you after the competition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Someone had a plan."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale was confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He thought, "What the hell is she talking about?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Was she scared out of her mind?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although Harry was a playboy, he knew his limits when doing things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana walked a few steps and then said, "Also, don't say I am your biological sister in the future. The Marsh family is not worthy of that. They call me their adopted daughter. Queenie is your dear sister. You should treat her as a treasure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What happened half a year ago was not Althea and I who plotted against you. It was Penelope who plotted against you. As for the reason, someone will tell you after the competition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Althea is right. Everyone in the Marsh family is cruel and ruthless. She should not love you for so many years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Don't harm Althea."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Diana finished speaking, she got into the car without giving Gale a chance to speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale was angry. When he heard Diana's words, the guilt in his heart disappeared in an instant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He said, "Diana, you are not allowed to slander Penelope. It is you who plotted against me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana sneered, "So stupid."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale glanced at the gate of the police station. He could say nothing when he went in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale had to get Diana to drop the case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He watched Diana's car leave and drove to chase Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Nolan glanced at Gale's car from the rearview mirror with sharp eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, Gale is chasing us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana sneered, "Never mind. With the evidence we provided, within two hours, what those people did will be posted on the Internet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Of course, Queenie must see this. At least she would be so angry that she wouldn't be able to sleep tonight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Nolan smiled, "Diana, I understand."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana said, "Well! There's a shopping mall. Take us there to buy clothes first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this time, her cell phone rang. It was an unfamiliar phone number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana guessed it was Gale, so she didn't answer it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But the other party kept calling her, which made her annoyed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What?" She said in a bad tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, are you okay?" Diana was stunned. It turned out to be Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She thought she had misheard, but Steven's voice sounded again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, are you okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana sneered, "I'm fine. Your childhood sweetheart didn't frame me successfully. Are you happy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven stood in front of the French window, looking at the scenery outside the window with cold eyes. "Diana, what are you talking about?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana's eyes became even colder. "Steven, do you know Harry, Queenie's pursuer? I know you are vicious, but I didn't expect this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's indeed good for you to let him destroy me. But, Steven, you have forgotten what I told you. I will not tolerate it anymore. I will fight back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven was furious. "Diana, you think I did this?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="118.html">« Prev</a><a href="120.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
