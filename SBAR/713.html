I'll go, I'll go! Diana, I'll definitely go. I'll wait for you to pick me up tomorrow morning."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Satisfied, Diana finally hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened the stock market app and checked, and yes, this was it. Cera Group's stock would surge in three days.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was confident about the three-day timeline. After confirming this, she didn't give it another thought and went to bed. The winter always made her extra sleepy, and the perfect temperature in her room assured her a deep slumber.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of making another killing in the market in a few days had her grinning from ear to ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She even forgot about the milk Steven had prepared for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The true sign of moving on from someone was that no matter how shocking their actions, you no longer feel surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana drifted off to sleep while Steven stood outside her door, having overheard her entire conversation with Cecil.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression was filled with resignation. The misunderstandings were piling up. Diana had completely moved on from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, she would never have gone to sleep before him. She would've made sure he drank his health tonic or waited until he was in bed before allowing herself to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All those little things he'd taken for granted were actually signs of Diana's special care for him, precious moments that had become an irreplaceable part of his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized he had once been the man she cherished most, but now that love was gone entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp pain pierced Steven's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, he turned and walked back to his room.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The following day, Diana got up early to make breakfast for Steven. By the time she finished, he had come downstairs. Steven seemed like his usual self today, though oddly in a better mood than usual.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had been incredibly busy lately, with meetings running from dawn till dusk, leaving little time to spend with Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat down and noticed Diana had made his favorite pasta. He watched her back as she stood at the stove making eggs.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A gentle smile played across his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned around and caught Steven's tender gaze. She froze for a moment. It was the first time he'd ever looked at her with such gentleness.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once upon a time, she had envied Queenie for being the recipient of Steven's softest looks.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, receiving such a look herself made her feel oddly uncomfortable, even awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She brought the fried eggs over and set them in front of him without a word, then took her seat across the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking down at her pasta, Diana took a bite, and her face lit up with satisfaction. "Delicious."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled proudly. After two years, her cooking skills had improved dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven watched her happy expression, unable to suppress his smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't dare speak, knowing it would probably just spoil Diana's good mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They ate their breakfast in comfortable silence, and he finished his large bowl of pasta feeling completely satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He elegantly dabbed his mouth with a napkin before asking Diana, "Are you heading to the office today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "No, I have other plans."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven narrowed his eyes slightly. So, she was going to pick up Cecil and accompany him to the stock market.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She really didn't give him a second thought anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven remembered how Diana used to wait up for him no matter how late he was out entertaining clients.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he wasn't home by midnight, she'd call to urge him back, and there'd always be his favorite soup waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd have his bath ready, too. He'd always taken these little gestures for granted.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after she left, no one did these things for him anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did he realize that these thoughtful details came from Diana's genuine care for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven watched Diana bustling around the kitchen in her light purple sweater, her hair tied back in a ponytail. He smiled, "Diana, I'm heading to the office."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="712.html">« Prev</a><a href="714.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
