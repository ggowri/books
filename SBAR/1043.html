"Eric's your real son, isn't he? </span><span>Y</span><span>ou gave </span><span>him the</span><span> </span><span>company. Did you ever think about me and Gale?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie said you didn&rsquo;t go bankrupt, and you even made billions this year. Yet, while I was abroad, you only gave me $20,000 a month. My allowance dropped from $100,000 to $20,000, and I didn&rsquo;t even complain."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula cut him off coldly, "You're in your twenties. </span><span>A</span><span>ny obligation to support</span><span> </span><span>you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>My money is mine, no need to give it to you.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you're so capable, go make your own money. Why are you eyeing my wealth?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula didn&rsquo;t spare Dylan any dignity. He was still too immature. The outside world would make him grow up fast.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he didn&rsquo;t grow up quickly, he&rsquo;d end up dead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan was stunned. He had always thought that no matter how old he was, he&rsquo;d always be a child in Paula&rsquo;s eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he left, they were a happy family. But after he came back, their home fell apart, and his world was no longer the same.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn&rsquo;t understand how Paula had become so heartless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Paula , I..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you're willing to listen to Queenie, even siding against me for </span><span>such</span><span> </span><span>illegitimate child, fine by me.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>Y</span><span>ou're an adult now, </span><span>you can make</span><span> your own decisions. But when you do, don't drag me into your mess. If you want to take my assets, go ahead and try.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But make one thing clear&mdash;if you die, I won't care."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula pointed toward Gale's room.</span><span> "</span><span>Gale&rsquo;s crippled 'cause she rigged his car. Frank? Gone, thanks to some woman she sent. Eric barely made it&mdash;Diana had to pull him out. And you? Please. You won&rsquo;t last a month. She&rsquo;s not keeping you around 'cause you matter. You&rsquo;re just bait&mdash;for me and Diana.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan found it utterly ridiculous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He let out a bitter laugh. "</span><span>S</span><span>o this is how you see Queenie. No wonder she took the family assets. If it were me, I&rsquo;d be even harsher. Diana? She&rsquo;s just a bastard. And yyou let her tear our whole family apart."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In families like ours, conflict is normal. The winner takes it all. Even if my dad caused your death, it&rsquo;s only because you couldn&rsquo;t beat him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dylan, enough. From today on, you're no longer my brother. Get out!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When you're no longer useful, do you think Queenie will still be this close to you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric was furious, completely losing it. He pointed at the door and shouted, "Get out, Dylan!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan actually dared to say Paula deserved to die. He was just as selfish as Jeff and Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They only cared about their own gain, never about family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan was on the verge of breaking down too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at Paula, "I&rsquo;m definitely taking legal action. I&rsquo;ll find out every asset under your name. You have to give </span><span>them back to me</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was furious, his tone sharp and full of hostility.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula was trembling with rage. This was her son. She wished she had never given birth to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She opened her eyes, her gaze filled with sorrow. "Dylan, since you&rsquo;ve </span><span>made your choice</span><span>, sign </span><span>the</span><span> </span><span>agreement </span><span>and</span><span> </span><span>cut ties with me. </span><span>We</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>re not related anymore</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My assets will only go to Eric and Gale, not you. Frank was already killed by Queenie. Since you're about to die, money shouldn't matter that much to you. Besides, it's my money, my decision."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula laughed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan felt scared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Paula , n-no, it&rsquo;s not that serious. I just want my share. Why would you want to cut ties with me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula sneered, </span><span>"Your share? </span><span>You&rsquo;ve never given me a dime. Never earned one either. I give you money every month like you&rsquo;re still a kid. Look around&mdash;your peers work, they stand on their own. But you? You throw tantrums when the money stops, then let someone egg you on to stab your own family</span><span>.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I won&rsquo;t </span><span>stop you from running to Queenie. Printer&rsquo;s in Gale&rsquo;s room. Sign the disownment papers. After that? You&rsquo;re on your own. Live or die&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan was stunned. Paula was serious!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was an adult. But in wealthy families, everyone lived off family money.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at Paula. He didn&rsquo;t want to cut ties with her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had some trouble abroad and needed her help. "</span><span>Come on</span><span>, don&rsquo;t be rash. I was just trying to reason with you, not wishing you dead!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula yelled, "Dylan, I&rsquo;m not being rash. You&rsquo;re fighting me over the inheritance for a </span><span>bitch</span><span>. A cruel son like you? I don&rsquo;t need."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She turned to Eric. "Eric, go print a disownment agreement. I have plenty of children. Even if one dies, I won&rsquo;t care."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He added, "I still have a sister. I can live without a brother."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes widened. Paula and Eric's conversation was driving him insane.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fine! Mom, Eric, don&rsquo;t you dare regret this."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric sneered, "The one who shouldn't regret is you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He went into Gale's room to print something. Hearing their argument, Gale woke up but stayed in bed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His leg was injured now, making it really inconvenient for him to get around.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dylan's back?" he asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah! </span><span>F</span><span>ight for the inheritance. Paula</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s </span><span>cutting ties with him." Eric said coldly, heading off to print the disownment agreement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale gave a cold smile. "Let him suffer a bit first. Otherwise, he'll never turn back, always shielding Queenie."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric thought the same.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the living room, Dylan looked at Paula's serious expression and let out a bitter laugh. "Paula, I'm your son. </span><span>R</span><span>eally bear to disown me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She nodded. "I'm old now, I can't fight you all. Just like you said earlier, I couldn't fight your father, and if I died, I deserved it. If that's how you see it, why would I need you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you think he's so great, then go to him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I-I never said he was great. I just mentioned the fights in wealthy families. Paula, you know what I mean."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula let out a cold laugh. "So, because I understand the rules, I deserve to die?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're discarded. At least I won, but you didn&rsquo;t even get a chance to fight&mdash;you were dismissed outright. I don&rsquo;t want a fool like you as my son either."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1042.html">« Prev</a><a href="1044.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
