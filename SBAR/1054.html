He lied to you. You two aren&rsquo;t even divorced yet, and you&rsquo;re talking about dating another man right in front of him. No wonder he passed out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana heard Luna's voice and asked in surprise, "When did you get here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna looked a bit surprised, "Diana, you still love him. I've been standing at the door for a while. I came up to call you both for dinner, but when I saw you talking, I didn&rsquo;t interrupt."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana didn&rsquo;t believe Luna and said, "Luna, I can even talk to him about finding a boyfriend. I don&rsquo;t love him anymore."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna knew Diana all too well. "Diana, you only say</span><span> </span><span>that to spite Mr. Gellar. When you mentioned Queenie, your tone was full of jealousy. Forget about Alexander. Just stay with Mr. Gellar already."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Impossible. You&rsquo;re underestimating me..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna said, "You should hurry up and wake Mr. Gellar. Could he be in danger?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was Diana's first love. She loved him deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked down at him. He had actually fainted from sheer emotion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at Luna, puzzled. "Luna, do you think he fainted because he cares about me and got upset by what I said?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna glanced at her silently, thinking Diana was emotionally clueless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But back then, Diana had actually pursued Steven for years.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna said, "How did you even realize you liked Mr. Gellar? I still remember the professor at the international medical center kept inviting you to study abroad. You turned him down</span><span>,</span><span> you wouldn&rsquo;t leave Mr. Gellar. How could you not notice that Mr. Gellar cared about you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sighed helplessly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought for a moment and said, "That professor looked at me differently. He seemed composed, and refined, something strange in the way he looked at me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna chuckled and teased, "</span><span>B</span><span>ecause he liked you. He probably thought someone as talented as you shouldn&rsquo;t stop here. If you went abroad, you&rsquo;d achieve so much more."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana scoffed, "Luna, he thought I was dumb. He saw me wearing designer clothes, driving a fancy car, and wanted me to invest in him. He had a girlfriend&mdash;a really pretty one. I&rsquo;ve seen her. No way I&rsquo;d follow someone like that abroad."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I had a good school, better professors than him, and in the end, I became a professor myself. I&rsquo;d never stay connected with someone like that."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That professor believed women were emotional fools, easy to manipulate. Later, he ruined his reputation for dating too many girlfriends."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna didn&rsquo;t pay attention to that professor&rsquo;s situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana laid Steven flat, "The year I met Steven and fell for him, because I was tired of studying. I wanted a break. Meeting Steven and letting go of my dreams wasn&rsquo;t really about him&mdash;it was because I&rsquo;d been pushing myself too hard."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"These three years, I&rsquo;ll just treat it as giving myself a break."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna knew Diana had been exhausted since she was a kid. Luna felt the same, but all the knowledge she learned had faded away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Diana picked up everything so quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The first time she touched a computer and keyboard, she mastered it on the very first day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back then, Diana had a huge appetite.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna and Nolan used to think Diana got smarter from eating so much. Later, they realized she was so intensely focused that she burned energy fast.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking back now, Luna thought they were so naive back then.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Luna remembered what happened online and felt uneasy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching Diana take care of Steven, she stayed silent and quietly walked away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana gave Steven a pill.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A few minutes later, he slowly opened his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Diana's worried gaze, he asked, confused, "Diana, what happened to me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana didn&rsquo;t know how to respond. He had fainted because he got too emotional.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hesitated and said, "You passed out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was surprised, unsure why he had passed out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Diana say she wanted to date another man, he felt a cold chill run through his body, and then everything went black.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now he realized it was Diana's words that made him pass out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven grabbed Diana's hand tightly, "Diana, you're not allowed to date other men."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stared at him, stunned</span><span>.</span><span> </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Did my words really make him pass out? How can he be this fragile?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "I was just talking casually. I meant in the future, not now. Right now, you've tricked me again, and I haven't even gotten mad at you yet. And now you're telling me I can't even talk to other men."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shot him an angry glare and said, "Other women get married and live happily ever after. But marrying you? I almost lost my life."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She truly didn&rsquo;t want to have anything to do with Steven anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven knew she had endured a lot. He said sincerely, "Diana, just give me some time. Once I sort everything out, I&rsquo;ll make you happy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes were red, his voice hoarse, and he stared at her intently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had never seen Steven this gentle before, and it left her a little flustered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Stop. Just take care of yourself. </span><span>Any idea</span><span> </span><span>about </span><span>your leg and eyesight? I </span><span>found</span><span> the herbs myself, nearly died. Please, don&rsquo;t get hurt again. I know Evan secretly gave you medicine, but I switched it with something </span><span>even helpful</span><span>. Your body is slowly healing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled proudly. "Steven, I&rsquo;ve saved you so many times. If </span><span>I didn</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>t</span><span> love you, you&rsquo;d be dead by now."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1053.html">« Prev</a><a href="1055.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
