After sending Steven back, he went to investigate. The video in the hotel was the biggest clue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As long as the man was in Capitole, Evan would always find him if he tried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie returned home and immediately sat on the couch, crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Both Jeff and Gale felt heartbroken seeing her cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula simply watched Queenie indifferently, wondering how she would slander Diana this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale had always spoiled Queenie since they were young. He sat next to her and asked, "Queenie, weren't you out shopping? Who upset you? Tell me, and I'll help you deal with it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie knew Gale still cared about her as always, so she took the chance to badmouth Diana. "Gale, today I took Penelope shopping, and we ran into Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"We also saw Steven, and Diana accused me of sending her taunting photos daily. She even showed the photos to Steven! He was furious and cut off my allowance. He used to give me millions every month! Diana's just jealous of me and deliberately scheming against me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I... I feel so wronged. Steven and I are the ones truly in love! Why does Diana have to treat me like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale was furious. Ever since Diana had returned, she'd brought nothing but chaos to their family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This woman was truly detestable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He angrily said, "Mom, say something about Diana! Now even Harry is in jail because of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"She's causing trouble with Steven again, cutting off Queenie's allowance. This woman is awful."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula sneered as she watched her son's arrogance. "She's getting worse, isn't she? Queenie, if Steven cuts off your allowance, that's as good as losing your lifeline. We can't afford to give you millions in allowance. The company is in worse shape than ever. I've been trying to find new partnerships, but we haven't secured anything without new products. At this rate, the Barnes family will go bankrupt. From this month forward, everyone's allowance is cut in half."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">By saying this, Paula knew Queenie would get anxious and go find Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She needed to keep those two locked together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She wouldn't let Queenie ruin her daughter's life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"And Gale, Harry is in jail because of you. One phone call from you almost ruined two lives. How did I end up with such a malicious son?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale was stunned. "Mom, how is this my fault? And is our family really in such bad shape?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula looked at him helplessly, feeling exhausted. What a fool.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was right. This family deserved its fate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What kind of people were they?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They were clearly in the wrong, yet they showed no sign of remorse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"As for the company, I've already laid off some staff and cut down on expenses. Your company has never contributed anything. You've wasted everything on race cars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Your dad's company hasn't been doing well for the past two years, either. Who knows where the money he makes goes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Honey, I checked the books. You made over ten million last year, but I haven't touched a cent of it. Why are your expenses getting bigger and bigger?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="135.html">« Prev</a><a href="137.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
