She couldn't understand why she was saying these things to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grandma..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, let me finish. Queenie has always been loyal to Andrew. If Steven treats you well, you won't be safe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana froze, still trying to process her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Helen continued, her tone steady, "You're smart, Diana. You should understand what I mean. When someone has someone they care about, it makes them vulnerable. You've been by his side for two years, and during his darkest moments, you helped him find his way out. How could he forget that? I raised my grandson. I know his nature better than anyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It took a moment, but Diana finally understood the meaning behind Helen's words. She was implying that Steven had treated her so harshly in the past to protect her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she didn't need him to protect her this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was too painful, and she could never forgive him for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, I know the damage has already been done, and nothing can undo the hurt. But until the truth is revealed, no one will know how it will all turn out. Maybe we're all just pawns in someone else's game."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Pawns?" Diana was shocked. Helen's words were cryptic, leaving her even more confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Jeff's hands, she had indeed been a pawn, her role only to keep Steven away from Queenie. Now that Queenie had returned, Diana had stepped aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in the eyes of others, who was she really a pawn for? The thought nagged at her, but she couldn't figure it out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, actually..." Helen leaned in, revealing something even more surprising.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Diana heard it, she was left speechless, utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grandma, is that true?" she gasped, her eyes wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was a secret she wasn't supposed to know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Helen's eyes filled with unshed tears, and her voice was filled with sorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, it's true. And we've also been scheming against Andrew. Diana, this is a high-stakes game, and it all comes down to who wins in the end. Steven has no idea. Your grandfather has spent years abroad, nearly half the time, just to investigate this. But the other side is so well-hidden. Your grandfather has been digging into this for decades, and he's just starting to uncover the truth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt like the ground had been pulled out from under her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She never imagined that this was all part of a deeper, more complex plot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But Grandma, they..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana couldn't bring herself to finish the sentence. Steven and Andrew looked so alike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Helen let out a bitter laugh. "That's their brilliance. Once Queenie's situation is settled, I'll tell you everything. Diana, you've never been innocent in all of this. Maybe you're the most important piece in this puzzle. When you learn the truth, you'll be even more shocked than I am."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grandmother, what do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's mind was racing, unable to process everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Helen smiled knowingly. "Diana, you should work with Steven. I know you hate him, but deep down, you can't bring yourself to hurt him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She understood Diana's capabilities. No one knew Diana's true identity, not even Paula.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Helen knew that Diana had hidden herself well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana met Helen's gaze, realizing that this wasn't about her reluctance to hurt Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was that she knew what would happen to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was just respecting his fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The shock of it all hit Diana like a freight train. She never imagined things could have gotten so out of hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She only wished she had never come here today. If this secret were to get out, she would be in grave danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sat there, her mind a whirlwind of confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Helen watched her anxiously. "Diana, did my words scare you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Snapping out of her daze, Diana quickly shook her head and forced a smile. "Grandma, no. I've been through things much more shocking than this. This doesn't scare me. What Jeff did was far more shocking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's a relief! The reason I'm telling you all this is that Steven has done some terrible things in order to take control of the Gellar family. But if he hadn't, it would've been Edward and me, you, and even his uncles who would've ended up dead. To protect his uncles and aunt, he had no choice but to maintain ties with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're a kind girl, Diana. It hurts me to see you caught up in all of this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana could tell Helen genuinely cared about her. If not, she wouldn't have bothered to visit again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grandma, why not tell Steven all of this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Helen sighed deeply. "It's not the right time yet. We don't even know how many illegitimate children Andrew has. A while ago, one of them attacked Steven's branch company. Steven went to deal with it, and it ended badly for both sides. He was hurt in the process."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's thoughts immediately went to the scar on Steven's arm. That must have been from that incident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hadn't paid much attention to him since, but she knew that wound still pained him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, Queenie isn't as innocent as she seems. I know you've been through a lot, and I also know that Steven's mother has suffered too. But she's the one who has suffered the most. She gave up her whole life for the family. I feel so sorry for her. But even after everything she did, it only saved her relatives' lives. In the end, it was all taken away by Andrew's scheming."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana couldn't help but think of Jenny, always carrying that look of sadness. Her heart tightened in sympathy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't know Jenny very well, but every time she saw her, the woman's eyes seemed full of sorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jenny clearly loved Steven deeply, but she could only watch him from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's breath caught in her chest. Even in her past life, she hadn't known any of this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had always been calm, living by Steven's side as though she had already resigned herself to a quiet life. She ignored so many things, always keeping her distance or quietly observing from afar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, she couldn't help but regret it. She should have stayed closer to Steven. Maybe then she'd have known more of the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grandma, Diana, I'm back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's voice came from the doorway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Helen beamed. "Come in, sweetheart. It's too cold outside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Diana heard all the revelations, her expression softened as she turned to look at Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He met her gaze and froze for a moment, only to find her watching him with an amused smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The tips of his ears flushed bright red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana couldn't help but laugh quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grandma, this is for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you! I've been feeling better lately, so I'll have a little."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Helen smiled, taking the cup and sipping it, savoring the familiar taste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven handed a cup to Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't hesitate, accepting it and taking a sip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven watched her intently. "Is it good?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="895.html">« Prev</a><a href="897.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
