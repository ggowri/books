"You'll find out the day after tomorrow. Just try not to cry your eyes out when you do."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana fought to keep her calm. "Fine! I'll wait and see. Whatever you're planning, your reputation is already shot to hell."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana hung up in fury, then examined her reflection in the mirror with narrowed eyes. Well, still the gorgeous Diana she knew and loved!</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She flipped her long hair and flashed herself a dazzling smile before turning on the shower.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had a pretty good guess what Queenie was up to.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She recalled the online news claiming that Queenie was carrying Levi's baby.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Queenie also claimed she was carrying Steven's child. So, one of these had to be a lie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie didn't love either man; Diana wondered what her game was.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven walked in just then, hearing the shower running and catching a whiff of the subtle body wash fragrance. His mind immediately went to dangerous places.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart raced as he stared at her silhouette through the shower door. He couldn't deny his desire for Diana anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Queenie cuddled up to him, he felt nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Diana had him completely spellbound.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven took a deep breath before heading downstairs to make Diana some milk.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana always had a glass of milk before bed. It was her nightly ritual.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unaware of Steven's presence, Diana was blow-drying her hair after her shower. Her long hair took quite a while to dry completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After putting away the hair dryer, she grabbed a tissue and crouched down to clean up the fallen strands of hair, then mopped up any water on the bathroom floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She made sure the sink area was spotless before leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her pink bathrobe complemented her freshly washed skin, making it appear even smoother, and her delicate features looked incredibly soft.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lost in thought, Diana walked forward while running her fingers through her hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hair was still warm, and she enjoyed massaging her acupressure points, believing in the holistic benefits of the practice.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep in thought, she suddenly bumped into Steven's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was startled and quickly looked up at Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As fate would have it, Steven had looked down at the exact moment, and their lips met unexpectedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana froze in surprise. "What is he doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tried to step back, but Steven held her close.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven smiled at her startled expression. It was the Diana he knew, with her wide, beautiful eyes full of surprise when caught off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not the guarded, defensive Diana she had become lately.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had just bathed, and her fresh scent was captivating.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His breath caught as his hands found her waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes grew intense with desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven couldn't help but lean down to kiss her lips, overcome by her presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mmph..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana pushed against Steven's chest with both hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare he! The absolute jerk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's kisses were intense, leaving Diana breathless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His passion was evident, his eyes filled with desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana pushed against him with all her might, but he didn't budge.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking quickly, she tried to bite his lip, but Steven seemed to anticipate it, pulling back only to resume the kiss, catching her by surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never knew kissing Diana could feel like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her resistance only fueled his determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven lifted her swiftly onto the bed, one hand behind her head, his legs restraining her movements while the gentle fragrance of her hair surrounded him.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="710.html">« Prev</a><a href="712.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
