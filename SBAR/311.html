Haven't you seen yourself bowing and scraping to others?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But Frank, I won't let you push me around anymore. You think I'm not good enough? How much ability do you have yourself?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I'm not good enough, why would Alexander sign a contract with our company? If I'm not good enough, why would your brother snatch my designs and give them to Steven, leading to Steven working with me?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Frank, what exactly do you mean by 'not good enough'?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank laughed bitterly, looking her up and down mockingly. "I bet you just ripped off someone else's work. Diana, you were a housewife for two years and didn't even go to college. I know exactly what you're capable of."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Marsh, what's wrong with being a housewife? Do you think housewives contribute less than you? Without their dedication, where would your polished image be?" Alexander's calm voice cut through the air like ice.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank had been back for a few days. He'd done his homework on Capitole's new elite and knew who Alexander was. Seeing him in the flesh, Frank softened his tone. "Mr. Powell, I'm just telling it like it is. Diana really can't do anything, can she?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He gazed at Alexander's stunningly handsome features, mesmerized at first glance.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That aura of elite sophistication completely overshadowed him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander knew Diana was exceptional; the Marsh family was just blind to it.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana turned to Alexander with a radiant smile. "Alexander, what brings you here?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's figure approached her, his presence enveloping her. "Didn't I say I'd pick you up from work? Come on, let's have dinner at my restaurant tonight. The chef's prepared all that seafood you sent over last time."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana chuckled, "Sounds great! Grandpa's out, so I'd be eating alone otherwise."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander grinned. His grandfather had just called, asking him to take Diana out for dinner. He would've done it anyway.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He led Diana to the car parked nearby.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana didn't spare Frank a single glance.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank felt a twinge of irritation, watching Diana's retreating figure with mounting frustration.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wasn't even divorced yet, and she was already so close to Alexander!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As expected, with a face like a vixen, she was always seducing men.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank stormed off, fuming.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's restaurant wasn't far from the office, just around the corner. Business was booming.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The second floor was reserved for guests with reservations.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander led Diana to a table by the window.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No need to order - they just had to wait.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander poured her some water.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thanks!" Diana smiled, gazing out the window at the gorgeous sunset.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander gave her a warm smile. "Come on, Diana. We're close enough now. No need to be so formal."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright! I'll loosen up then!" Diana actually wanted to be less formal. She hoped to become friends with Alexander.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander pulled out a gift and handed it to Diana. "This is a bracelet my grandfather bought at an auction overseas. He wanted me to give it to you."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was taken aback. She'd never even met Roy.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she couldn't refuse his gesture. "Please thank your grandfather for me!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana accepted it with both hands. Opening it, she gasped, "The Crystal Dream!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander was surprised she recognized it. "Wow, I didn't expect you to know about it."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's expression stiffened slightly. Her grip on the box tightened as she joked, "What, you think being a housewife for a few years means I don't know anything?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="310.html">« Prev</a><a href="312.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
