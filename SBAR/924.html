His voice was cold as he said, "My company is already gone. How can I help you get yours back?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've been abroad for years. Aside from acting foolish, wasting money, and indulging in pleasures, how many deals have you closed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How many projects have you completed? Did your time studying abroad go straight into the gutter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah froze, staring at the cold and ruthless man before him. He thought, "This can't be right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isn't Steven incredibly doting on my sister?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hasn't he always granted her every wish?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even while living abroad, I had heard about how Steven was willing to do anything for her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, Steven, I'm Queenie's brother. My company is in trouble. If you won't help me, what should I do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was on the verge of losing his mind. His company was completely finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Noah, he has no obligation to help you. Your company was shorted and acquired because you're incompetent. Let me ask you, instead of staying at your company during this critical time, why did you suddenly come back here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie knew his personality too well. The only reason he'd return was if something had gone terribly wrong with his business abroad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had any money left, he wouldn't have come back at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah realized he couldn't hide the truth anymore and explained in a low voice, "Queenie, I know I am useless. Earlier, a friend introduced me to a project that seemed highly profitable. But after I invested all my money, he ran off with it. Now, my company has no cash flow. I came back hoping Dad could lend me some money. That's when I found out Mom had already divorced him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom was so stupid. He used to give me thirty million dollars every year. In recent years, he has given even more. It was more than enough for my lifestyle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing his complaints, Queenie was so furious she nearly lost her footing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "This idiot! All that money could have been used for serious business, yet he squandered it all on his indulgences."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out!" Queenie shouted, her voice filled with frustration. She could not believe this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Noah's company couldn't be saved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't accept it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought this shouldn't happen at all. For weeks, she'd been having strange dreams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These fragmented dreams brought her moments of joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Noah stared at her with surprise. "Queenie, I'm your brother. You want me to get out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie felt a sharp pain in her head, thinking, "How could my life turn out this way?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her plans, her life was supposed to be smooth and effortless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lately, she had been having recurring dreams. Years later, she stood as the most revered businesswoman in Capitole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Steven, who loved her to the point of obsession, was eliminated by her after she had dealt with Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Together with George, she had seized everything the Gellar family owned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, even George had died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood alone on the most prestigious stage for business elites, admired and celebrated by countless people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in her dreams, the glow of that moment filled her with happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In those dreams, she was sharp, wise, and every bit a queen who controlled the grand chessboard of life. She rescued herself countless times and ultimately achieved the life she desired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially in last night's dream, she saw herself tormenting Paula's family, driving them to utter despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula ended up in a mental institution, and Queenie's mother finally succeeded in helping her take everything Paula had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula's parents, devastated by the loss of their family fortune and the deaths of their four grandchildren, couldn't bear the blow and committed suicide together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie then took possession of all their properties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Diana was also dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those dreams were a mix of chaos and clarity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They felt like dreams, yet disturbingly real, as if they had truly happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those dreams had troubled her this morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, are you okay?" George asked, steadying her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie shook her head. "I'm fine. Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah wouldn't let them leave. "Queenie, Mr. Gellar, you can't just walk away. You have to help me get my company back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Annoyed, Queenie yelled, "Noah, if you want your company back, go find your real father. I can't help you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring him, Queenie and George quickly walked out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah was dumbfounded. Queenie just... left?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't going to help her own brother?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, are you really going to abandon me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie turned back, her gaze icy. "Noah, you're not cut out to run a company. All you do is throw money into bottomless pits. You only know how to indulge in food, drink, and pleasure, clinging to two women every night. That's your life. No matter how much money I give you, you'll always be a worthless pile of mud that can't be shaped into anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah broke down in tears. "How could you look down on me like this, Queenie? I'm your brother!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie didn't even acknowledge him and walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the hospital, Paula was chatting with Gale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was aware of what had happened at Gellar Group and had just learned today that Edward had made Steven sign the agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven, in his desperation to be with Queenie, had given everything to Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never could have imagined this outcome, not even in her wildest dreams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, do you think Diana can handle the role of CEO at Gellar Group?" Gale asked, feeling much better after his surgery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula nodded confidently. "Gale, believe in your sister! She's incredibly capable. We've simply overlooked her talents. I've placed trusted people by her side, and they've reported back that your sister is working with Tom to develop a smart medical system. This project will shock the world. Let's just wait for the good news."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula kept another secret about Diana in her heart. She planned to reveal it to her when Diana became strong enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale also hoped Diana could uphold the Gellar Group's legacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven is a disgrace. For Queenie, he abandoned the entire Gellar Group!" Gale thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I really don't understand Steven. Queenie is so vicious, but he would rather give up all his property to be with her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula sneered, "Steven doesn't deserve Diana. But Queenie? She's more than a match for him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Paula received a call from Eric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was very happy. "Eric."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, Noah's company has been acquired," Eric reported.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula's eyes lit up. "That's wonderful, Eric. Stay with Ave for now and make sure the company is properly managed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Noah may be a fool, but his company was well-managed by professional executives. It has a solid foundation. Within a year, it should be ready to go public."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric was deeply moved. "Mom, thank you for giving me this opportunity and for allowing me the time to grow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice choked with emotion. If he hadn't fallen into despair once, he might never have matured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula's eyes glistened with tears. "Eric, we owe this to your sister. At Queenie's birthday party, she revealed the truth to me. That's why we were able to turn the tide. But remember, now is not the time to expose ourselves. You and your brothers must be patient and follow my plan."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="923.html">« Prev</a><a href="925.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
