The room wasn't exactly soundproof, and every word was making her more embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't have much knowledge about sex, and Diana's sudden question was enough to make her heart race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I... I've never tried it, so I don't know if he's any good. Ten minutes doesn't seem like much, but he's got some strength. Yvette sounded like she was suffering."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana blinked, curious if George was maybe the violent type.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right, we've never been through this, so I asked the wrong person," Diana said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I think we can rule him out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yvette belongs to him. Let's look into her connections and check her family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna nodded, her face still red. "Okay! Diana, let's go find Mr. Turner. After we say goodbye, we'll head back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's voice was sharp and clear. "Right. Let's go. We'll get home early, sleep well, and enjoy Christmas tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the other room, Steven and Evan listened as the sound of the two women's voices faded away, their conversation filled with lighthearted amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's expression darkened. He had never been with a woman, so why did Diana think he was lacking in that department?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One day, she'll see whether I'm capable or not," he thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What angered him, though, was that George had somehow allowed his wife to overhear such disgusting talk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven clenched his jaw. He hated himself for not knowing how to love someone until Diana had already left, for not valuing her when he had the chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had once said that late love was worthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this world, no one truly couldn't live without another person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only reason Diana hadn't divorced him sooner was that she wanted to completely heal his eyes. Once that task was finished, she left without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan, watching him carefully, now understood why Steven looked so upset. It was all </span><span>because Diana had </span><span>implied</span><span> he was impotent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was stunned and couldn't help but ask, "Mr. Gellar, you've been married for years. You really have saved yourself for Queenie? I mean, Mrs. Gellar has got a perfect figure. You've never felt anything for her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's face grew dark. He wasn't faithful to Queenie, not at all. He gave Evan a cold look and said, "I'm disabled. I may want to, but I can't. It's not about Queenie. The truth is, I didn't feel anything for Diana before. I'm not a man driven by looks or desire. I've always been indifferent, with no need for that sort of thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And back then, I was just trying to stay alive. Anyone I cared about would have died long before me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't some heartless person. He had been moved before, but his life had always been in danger, and he didn't dare to love anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only after realizing his feelings for Diana that he understood love, but by then, the gap between them had become too wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan almost laughed. He could tell that Steven was just brushing it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had been convincing enough. Even Evan had thought his heart belonged to Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Steven's mind worked differently. He treated Queenie well because she had been placed in his life by Andrew. As for Diana, since he didn't care about her, Andrew didn't need to act against her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, if you knew about Queenie's plan back then, why didn't you just deal with her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's chest tightened. If he had killed Queenie, he would have been finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He longed to see Diana, but he knew that seeing her would only make him feel worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because my mother was poisoned. I suspected it was Queenie, and now I'm sure she was behind it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She framed Diana once. At the time, I didn't believe it, but I found out the truth. I knew it was her. But I didn't do anything. I just waited for George to make his move."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven closed his eyes, his heart heavy with pain as he thought about what his mother had gone through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan lowered his gaze and shook his head. He felt sorry for Steven, but at least he was here, supporting him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aside from his grandparents and Diana, Steven didn't trust anyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, since Yvette is working for George, should we let Queenie in on this? Let them go at each other."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan couldn't help but start missing Luna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven shook his head slightly. "Not yet. Save the video from earlier. Wait until they're more deeply involved, then expose it. Queenie loves George. Let her feel the sting of betrayal from the one she loves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan nodded. "Got it. I've already asked Dalton to investigate Yvette."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven gave a simple nod. "Good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven glanced at the video on his phone. The club was under his name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dalton had set everything up in advance, and every detail of the break room was in </span><span>his control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He replayed the video and watched Diana's playful, innocent smile. It made his lips curve up involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing her meal, Diana found Joshua. "Mr. Turner, I'll leave the rest to you. I'm heading back to rest. Merry Christmas!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua, standing next to Dalton, seemed even more impressive. "Ms. Bishop, you head back and rest. Merry Christmas!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana flashed him a dazzling smile. "See you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna pushed Diana out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the elevator, as they waited, the doors opened to reveal a girl rushing out, looking flustered and barely clothed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She froze when she saw Diana clutching her scanty clothes to her chest. She ran up to Diana, her voice shaky. "Miss, please help me. They forced me to drink, stripped me, and pressured me into signing an unfair contract. Please, I need your help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana recognized her immediately. It was Kara Black, the once-prominent jewelry designer in her past life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was the one Queenie had signed after she won her first competition in school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for seeing her tonight, Diana might have forgotten she even existed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned to Luna. "Luna, take her to my break room. Tell Nick to bring up a set of clothes from my car. Quick!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna looked worried. "Diana, I can't leave you alone here. It's not safe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, reassuring her. "It's fine. I'm safe here. I'll wait for Nick. Once he's back, we'll head to the break room together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reluctantly, Luna helped Kara toward the break room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after they left, another elevator arrived. Two men stepped out, fuming. "Dammit, Kara got away!" one growled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other man sneered, "It's fine. She won't get far. Her family's drowning in debt. Her dad's a gambler. She'll have no choice but to sign with us. Even if she tries to run, she won't make it past the school gates. We'll talk to Mr. Gillespie upstairs, and I'll track her down tomorrow. She'll sign, one way or another."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither man noticed Diana as they got on the elevator and headed upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes narrowed. She wondered if the man they were talking about was Mario.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="952.html">« Prev</a><a href="954.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
