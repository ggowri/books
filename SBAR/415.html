She warned, "Watch your language. If you can't speak respectfully, keep silent. Becoming Joseph's classmate and reaching this point shows you've put in a lot of effort. Don't always speak in such a snide manner."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You dare to hit me? Aren't you afraid of what I might do to you? I'm a high-level hacker..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana interrupted him with a cold laugh, "Your skills are not even worth my attention. Try to be a decent human being."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You... Just you wait. I won't forget this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jacob stormed off in anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph looked at Diana. "Diana, you should have let me hit him just now. Your hand must be hurting, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shook her head with a gentle smile. "No! Joseph, remember, from now on, I am your backing. Don't let anyone bully you. Your tolerance and concession will only make you angry and encourage them to be more aggressive. Remember, if kindness isn't met with respect, the best way is to turn the tables."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the tender night, Diana's cold voice echoed in Joseph's ears, deafening and soul-stirring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She appeared gentle with a soft voice, yet the force of her slap was significant. This stark contrast held Joseph's attention captive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, I understand. I won't let anyone bully me anymore." His eyes were clear and bright, like twinkling stars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled casually, "Alright, you go back in. I'll wait for the car here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph insisted, "I want to make sure you get in the car safely."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana laughed. "Alright."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Watching her tender smile, Joseph suddenly blushed, slightly lowering his head with a hint of awkwardness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She turned only to see Evan stepping out of a luxury car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She frowned slightly as Evan reached her side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She asked, "Evan, why are you here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan replied, "Ms. Bishop. Mr. Gellar wants to see you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's gaze turned cold. "I don't want to see him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Bishop, it's Madam Gellar. She's ill and wants to see you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Helen is sick?" Her eyes showed some concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Putting aside everything else, Helen had always been very kind to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There weren't many people in this world who were kind to her, and she would cherish everyone who was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes. Mr. Gellar is here to pick you up. Ms. Bishop, please get in the car."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Evan caught sight of Joseph standing nearby. He thought in shock, "Oh my God! Another incredibly handsome man. Diana is surrounded by handsome men after leaving Mr. Gellar. This man's looks are on par with Cecil's. Too charming!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked at Joseph. "Joseph, I have to go now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph said reluctantly, "Diana, take care. Goodbye."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana responded, "Okay, goodbye!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She walked towards the multi-million-dollar luxury car by the roadside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The door opened, revealing the man inside, exuding arrogance and dominance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph looked at Steven, his eyes hostile, his fists clenched. He thought, "Who is he?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven also looked at him. In the brief moment their eyes met, Joseph felt a chill run down his spine. Such a cold gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Inside the car, Steven looked at Diana with displeasure and said sarcastically, "Diana, so you've replaced me with another man? But this one seems a bit young. Do you have a thing for young boys?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="414.html">« Prev</a><a href="416.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
