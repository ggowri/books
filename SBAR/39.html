Queenie was the first to spot Diana and couldn't help but question her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What right did she have to be at tonight's banquet?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And she was wearing the latest dress from the magazine cover, one that Queenie couldn't even get her hands on. How could Diana have bought it?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven also noticed Diana&mdash;tonight, she looked dazzling.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wore only a black strapless gown, with a ring of diamonds around the neckline that accentuated her delicate skin. Her long hair was pinned up, giving her an air of cool elegance, understated yet exuding a breathtaking luxury.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A flash of awe crossed Steven's eyes. She really had changed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Steven's gaze land on Diana's face, Queenie was consumed with jealousy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ever since the incident with Cecil had fallen through, she'd been feeling down these past few days.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now the Farley family was investigating what happened that day. She was genuinely scared that the issue with the bodyguards might lead back to her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana raised her eyebrows and smiled brightly at Queenie. "If you can be here, why can't I?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Contempt filled Queenie's eyes. "Diana, do you even know where you are? This is a banquet held by old Mr. Powell for his grandson who just returned from abroad. It's also a business networking event.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I know you want to cling to Steven like before, but you should pick the right occasion. Steven has an important deal tonight. Don't mess it up. Even if you don't know better, at least have some decency."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven thought of how Diana used to cling to him, and a trace of disgust flickered in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana caught that look, and felt a sharp pang inside!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All the care she'd shown Steven in the past was nothing but an annoyance in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Pfft..." Diana couldn't help but laugh. Her eyes sparkled with amusement. "Queenie, I haven't even looked at Steven once. Who are you performing for? I've always believed that anything taken from me was garbage. If you like picking up trash, go right ahead.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If Steven loves groveling at your feet, you can bask in his affection all you want. Why drag me into it? We're divorced now. If you ever try to tie me to him again, I'll expose all your dirty little secrets."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled as she warned her, knowing that her smile alone could make Queenie sick with rage.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stared at her, fixed in place. She was smiling so brightly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stood under the lights, exuding an air of wealth and power.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana didn't even want to spare him a glance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie furrowed her brow and looked at Steven with a pitiful expression. "Steven, Diana's trying to frame me again."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana blinked her big eyes, her gaze playful and lively&mdash;this side of her, Steven had never seen before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Frame you? You sure think highly of yourself. Why would I need to do that? Your face is a disaster all on its own."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana walked over with a cheerful smile, watching Queenie's anxious expression, and sweetly grinned at her. "Queenie, we're just getting started. Why are you so scared already?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You and your dad know full well all the things you wrongfully accused me of. Just because I haven't said anything, don't think I'm a fool."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled, "Do you need me to publicly recount your past actions?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Like&hellip;stealing my husband, staging a drama to frame me, and taking credit for saving Mrs. Farley..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When did Diana become so lively?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie stomped her foot in exasperation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In truth, that was Diana's nature.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was spoiled since she was a child, so she was active by nature.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, when she came back to the Marsh family, those rules constrained her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana made herself a different person for these ungrateful guys, and it was one of the things she regretted doing the most.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now that she was going to be herself, she could laugh, say what she wanted to say and do what she wanted to do without any fear. She didn't have to pretend to be silent, so she felt truly at home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>" look, God is everywhere. l had never hurt Queenie, but you guys framed me every time. I won't give you a chance like this again from now on."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven couldn't stand it and yelled in a low voice, "Diana, that's enough!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="38.html">« Prev</a><a href="40.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
