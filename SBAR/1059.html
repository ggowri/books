"Diana, what if you get hurt again? You can't take that risk. Your leg injury hasn't even healed yet</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>can't afford to push yourself. As for Dylan, just have him taken care of directly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His deep voice was filled with concern.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head, "No. I </span><span>have to on board</span><span>. When have I ever won without risking? I want to beat Dylan fair and square, crush Queenie. She wants to be some business queen? Well, I'll make sure she falls flat on this path."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>R</span><span>emember the beginning?" Her gaze turned sharp. "To expose Queenie's schemes, I took two slaps from Cecil and one from you. My ears rang for days. If I weren&rsquo;t in good shape, those three slaps would&rsquo;ve landed me in the hospital."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From that day on, I swore&mdash;no one gets to hurt me again, not unless it&rsquo;s me.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I can take the pain, the bruises, the scars.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But my heart? My soul?</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span>&mdash;</span><span> </span><span>Off-limits.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So what if it's dangerous? I have to survive. Only by staying alive can I see hope."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I won't get into trouble, and I don't need you to do anything for me. Taking down Dylan and sending him to jail is a piece of cake for me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No one can understand my will to survive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not</span><span> just to live&mdash;I want to live brilliantly, to shine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If I&rsquo;m not ruthless, the enemy will keep pushing, trampling over my boundaries step by step.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If I make it through this year, what about next year?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I still want to play cards and laugh with my family and friends like I did this year. Even if I lose, I&rsquo;d still feel happy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She would never forget that she once died on Christmas Eve. While others were celebrating with family, fireworks lighting up the night sky, she lay disfigured in the freezing snow with the unborn child she never got to meet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven clenched his fists, saying nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The air froze instantly, heavy and suffocating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna, Evan, and the others felt the tension between the two. They quickly found excuses and left one by one.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only the two were left in the living room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana casually picked up her coffee cup and took a sip, soothing her throat. She was exhausted from working tirelessly for the company every single day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though she wasn&rsquo;t going to the office today, Dylan was bound to throw a fit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maybe she could take this chance to dig up some dirt on him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She sent Nolan a message: [Nolan, anything about Dylan&rsquo;s overseas activities?]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Dylan's reckless nature, he must have been spending lavishly before Paula went bankrupt.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now that Paula's declared bankruptcy, his allowance is bound to be cut.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His life can't be as extravagant as before, those fair-weather friends are bound to ditch him. To save face, he's definitely going to do something shady.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana knew it was always an advantage to understand her opponent. Only by grasping his weaknesses could she smoothly execute her plans.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nolan replied, [Diana, got the information. </span><span>S</span><span>end it to you in a bit.]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana: [Alright!]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then she put down her phone. Catching Steven's guilty look, she couldn&rsquo;t help but smile. "Steven, don&rsquo;t give me that look, like I&rsquo;m bullying you or something."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had to give it her all to handle what was coming next.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn&rsquo;t want to let flirting with him get in the way of serious business.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven took a deep breath, "I know I hurt you. Every single moment now reminds me of how awful I was back then."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm fine. I'll get my revenge for the pain I went through myself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I intentionally lost to Queenie to make her overconfident, but Ms. Barnes saw through it and exposed everything."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Only by letting her believe everything comes easy can we bring her down. But it's not too late now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Next, I'm launching the hot spring resort project, and Queenie will definitely try to mess it up."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If she can't get this project, she'll rush into emerging industries, falling right into our trap."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching her speak with such confidence, Steven felt a pang of bitterness in his heart. For the past three years, she had been by his side, and her talent had been completely overlooked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gave a helpless smile. "Diana, these past three years, I&rsquo;ve let you down. I buried your talent. If </span><span>not for </span><span>me, you&rsquo;d be much further ahead by now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his sincere words, Diana suddenly laughed. "Further ahead? Where could I go? Isn't this how everyone lives? You can live without me, and so can I."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as I can be happy, it doesn&rsquo;t matter where I am. Those years by your side weren&rsquo;t all sadness. Before Queenie came back, I lived with you every day. Just looking at your face made me happy. Even when you ignored me, I found my own joy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is good now. I thought you two would team up, and I&rsquo;d have to deal with both of you. But since you&rsquo;re on my side now, got a lot better."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All in all, Diana hadn&rsquo;t lost a thing, so she thought this ending wasn&rsquo;t too bad.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for the future, she figured their paths wouldn&rsquo;t cross again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everything would just take its course.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If time could prove Steven's sincerity, maybe she&rsquo;d let go of her grudge and reconcile with him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Love is an unpredictable journey&mdash;either filled with thorns or smooth sailing, full of sweetness and stability.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, it&rsquo;s these challenges that help people see their own hearts clearly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana suddenly said, "Steven, thinking about the good times we had, I feel like anything&rsquo;s possible. Good luck!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all, you were my first love, I&rsquo;ve never been able to forget all these years. My first knot is untied now, and as for everything else, wait for you to explain it slowly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Steven&rsquo;s dejected and insecure look, Diana felt she had to throw him a little sweetness to lift his spirits.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the previous life, Steven didn&rsquo;t personally harm Diana or her child. He even protected them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie admitted herself, and Diana had experienced it firsthand, so there was no doubt about it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Diana felt as calm as still water, an unprecedented sense of ease washing over her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, the joy brought by money played no small part.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had already won effortlessly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's words reignited a spark of hope in Steven's dim eyes. "Diana, you really mean it?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1058.html">« Prev</a><a href="1060.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
