She's trying to sow discord and make you confess to your crime."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe broke down and screamed, "Mario, I just want to know one thing. Have you ever loved me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Mario had never loved her, everything would be meaningless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario stared at her firmly and angrily said, "Shut up, don't say anything from now on."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as they stay silent, Diana and Steven can't do anything to them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario believed Queenie would definitely save him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario smiled at Diana and said, "Diana, so what if you caught me on the spot? I'll just return the computer to you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at him helplessly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you ignorant of the law?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You used love as an excuse to deceive Chloe into stealing research results for you. Mario, this is a serious crime. Combined with your previous murder, your life is ruined."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie used you to do many heinous things. Do you think you can easily get away with it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She is the mastermind. If you're willing to take all the blame for her, she'll make even bigger mistakes. As long as I'm alive, she'll find a way to kill me. If I give her a chance, she'll also be sentenced."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario gave a bitter smile because what Diana said was true. The desperate Queenie would drag Diana down with her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, you have everything. Why won't you let Queenie go?" Mario shouted emotionally.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana now has Steven protecting her, and the Marsh family cares about her. But Queenie only has Mario.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario said, "Diana, no matter what kind of hurt you suffered before, everyone loves you now. Why are you still targeting Queenie?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana angrily said, "Mario, how dare you say that. It&rsquo;s you who never let me go. If you didn&rsquo;t trouble me, would you have ended up a prisoner?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"All of this was your underhanded manipulation. You've brought this upon yourselves. Why are you blaming me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Does this make you feel any better?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario sat on the ground in despair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's computer was smashed by him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario sneered and said, "Diana, I smashed the computer. If I can't have it, neither can you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Joseph was amused by his words. "Are you out of your mind? It's just a computer you smashed. You'll figure it out soon enough."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario was about to ask a question when several police officers suddenly came in and restrained the three of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The buyer was stunned upon seeing this scene.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He just wanted to enjoy the profits of artificial intelligence in advance. He had heard about this patent long ago. After buying it, he planned to sell it abroad, but he didn't expect to fall into a trap.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew Steven. "Mr. Gellar, this has nothing to do with me. I didn't know their AI system was stolen. Queenie called me, saying she had something good to sell, so I came over. I really didn't know it was stolen."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said coldly, "The police will investigate this."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe was desperate; she no longer wanted to argue for herself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn't escape the punishment for her crime.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She dropped her facade, returning to her former innocent and adorable self. Looking at Tom, she cried and said, "Professor Cullen, I'm sorry I let you down. If I had worked diligently and not been tempted by money, I could have become an excellent professor like you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I ruined my own life. Honestly, I&rsquo;ve felt regret and confusion, but I had already started. At night, I was tormented by shame, yet I just couldn&rsquo;t let go of the benefits and the temptation Mario brought me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Professor Cullen, thank you for being willing to help me back then."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Chloe had nothing, someone was willing to help her, yet she still ran toward the abyss in the end.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tom said nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe's crimes will not change.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Three people were taken away by the police.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After thanking his friends, Steven took Diana home. The rest was left to Joseph and Evan to handle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Joseph and Evan cooperated seamlessly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the way back, Diana was in a bad mood. Whether someone died or went to jail, she felt no joy from revenge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She just felt that what they did wasn't worth it. They ruined their lives for momentary gain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana remained sullen until she got home.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at Diana with concern and said, "Diana, Mario was right. The harm we caused you in the past was real."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana heard his words, gently shook her head, and said, "I don't mind, Steven. If you truly feel guilty, then love me well from now on."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana cried.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven held her tightly and kissed her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a long time, Steven let her go and said, "Diana, I really love you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana knew he loved her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was very happy!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She smiled and asked, "Steven, do you want to watch my game?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven frowned and asked, "Diana, are you really going to help Elroy with the game?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled and nodded, saying, "I already promised him, I can't go back on my word. Steven, you haven't seen me race before, now you have the chance."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her and said, "Alright! I'll go with you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven took out his phone, booked a ticket to Raventia, and left that night.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan and Joseph working together will make Queenie lose everything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After receiving the news of Mario's arrest, Queenie collapsed to the ground. She could no longer smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "Am I really going to end like this?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1161.html">« Prev</a><a href="1163.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
