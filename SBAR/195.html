They grabbed a quick bite to eat, changed clothes, and headed straight to Jace's banquet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Before getting into the car, Luna handed Diana a report on Queenie's recent movements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana's expression changed dramatically after reading it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie always liked to scheme against Diana in crowded settings, and she never held back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana looked at Luna and asked, "Who from the Marsh family is attending tonight?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna replied, "Besides Gale, Queenie, and Paula would go. I heard Mr. Foliot's assistant personally deliver the invitation. Their whole family is well-regarded and will be honored guests tonight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A thoughtful look flashed in Diana's eyes. This was Queenie's usual tactic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tonight, Queenie would surely use Jace to teach her a lesson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The only thing that could destroy her and force Steven to divorce her would be...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Only Cecil could help her now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After thinking for a moment, Diana sent Cecil a video call and explained her plan to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After finishing, Diana also explained the plan to Luna.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana pointed to a photo and showed it to Luna. "Luna, if what I suspect happens, you must find this woman first. Do you understand? Tonight, have our people work as waitstaff at the banquet. If I'm right, all surveillance at the event will be sabotaged."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna nodded. "Diana, I've already made the necessary arrangements."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Good," Diana said, feeling reassured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Foliot family was also one of Capitole's noble families, comparable to the Farley family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Capitole's elite families were deeply intertwined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Daughters of such families often married into other familiar noble families to solidify status and interests.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana had grown up in this world, but she was lucky. Her grandfather never forced her into an arranged marriage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In her family, they relied solely on their abilities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But for the noble daughters, love wasn't always a choice. If they met the right person, it was fine; if not, they might suffer a lifetime of misery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's parents were a tragic result of such an arranged marriage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Andrew was a complete scoundrel, with many illegitimate children outside the family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rumor had it that he had returned. Andrew had never liked her because she couldn't be controlled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had always wanted Queenie to marry Steven because Queenie followed his every word, and he treated her like his own daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If Queenie could manipulate Steven, then Andrew could control Steven too, keeping tabs on his every move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven was the biggest victim in this marriage; he was withdrawn and brooding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If it weren't for his grandfather's protection, Steven wouldn't have survived in this world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana suddenly wondered if Andrew also knew about Queenie's relationship with that man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana thought deeply until she reached Jace's residence's front gate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, we're here," Luna reminded her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana snapped back to reality. She lifted her dress, got out of the car, handed the invitation to the butler for confirmation, and waited for Luna to park. Luna returned quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana!" Cecil called out as he spotted her from a distance and jogged over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil was dressed formally tonight, wearing a black suit that highlighted his striking, almost bewitching features. He looked more beautiful than any woman, with his styled long bangs adding a hint of allure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana nodded slightly toward him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil flashed a mischievous smile, his gaze reassuring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana still trusted him; Cecil was quite reliable when it came to serious matters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Luna, let's go inside," Diana said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just as Diana was about to walk forward, she noticed two people approaching from the opposite direction, her eyes darkening.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="194.html">« Prev</a><a href="196.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
