Her voice was soon lost in the wind and snow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled sweetly, looking at her all bundled up like a little seal, and waved her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Althea, I'll be right up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Diana went to the trunk and took out some nutritional supplements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had prepared medicine for Althea. Because she was very happy, she walked a bit hastily and didn't notice Penelope behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope was visiting relatives on the island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly saw Diana and then noticed Althea upstairs. She was slightly taken aback, not understanding why Althea would be there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "This bitch has been gone for several months. Why did she suddenly show up here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Penelope secretly followed Diana upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The houses on the island were all four stories tall, and Althea lived in an apartment on the third floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was warm with the heater on. Although the wind was strong at night, she had already gotten used to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana quickly went up to the third floor, and Althea had already opened the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, come on in. It's cold outside," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here, here, I've brought milk powder for your child," Diana said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You brought so many things last time you came, and the baby hasn't even been born yet. Can it really eat that much?" Althea was very happy. Paige and Diana were the best to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing on the second floor, Penelope saw Althea's prominently bulging belly, and her face instantly contorted with a grim expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea was pregnant, and based on her due date, it seemed she had sex with Gale in a hotel a few months ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How... How could this be possible?" Penelope, touching her own slightly bulging belly, wished she could tear Althea to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the child in her womb was not Gale's, the child had now been acknowledged by the Song family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale still sent her money every month for prenatal care. Speaking of money, Queenie should have sent her the monthly payment by now; it had already been several days past due.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope, after watching Diana follow Althea inside, went downstairs to call Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey! Penelope, I'm filming. What do you want?" &#8203;Queenie, on the other side sounded a little impatient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope was very angry and did not notice her impatience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, why hasn't the money been transferred to my account yet? It's already several days late, and I'm running out of money. Please transfer the money to me first," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie said with a cold smile, "Penelope, my elder brother is already disabled. Are you really still thinking about marrying him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope was slightly taken aback and suddenly understood what she meant. In fact, she was also very anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale no longer cared for her as he did before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, what do you mean? Are you not going to give me money anymore? Don't forget that it was you who asked me to frame Gale. If I tell him and your mother about this, do you think they would still trust you?" she shouted at the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because Penelope has a hold over Queenie, she dared to be so unscrupulous in causing her trouble and asking for money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Penelope, you are threatening me," Queenie said in a cold tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Penelope sneered. "Queenie, I don't want to threaten you. I just want myself and the child in my belly to be safe and sound. I just want my child to live in a good environment after being born."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="545.html">« Prev</a><a href="547.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
