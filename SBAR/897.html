"It's really good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She liked drinking milk too. One cup before bed always helped her sleep soundly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was just a habit of hers and maybe also the reason why her breasts were full.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Steven heard her compliment, he smiled faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He grabbed his own cup, inserted a straw, and took a sip. It wasn't too sweet, but the flavor was rich and thick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three of them sat there, enjoying their hot chocolate in a relaxed, pleasant atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After finishing her drink, Helen grew drowsy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana helped her back to bed, making sure she was settled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once she was asleep, Diana went downstairs, only to find Steven and Andrew still sitting in the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hesitated, not wanting to face that old scoundrel, so she lingered at the top of the stairs, waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew narrowed his eyes, a dangerous gleam flickering as he turned his gaze toward Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, let me clear something up about what Queenie said. Back then, I was worried you'd fall into autism, so I had her stay with you. It wasn't for any other reason. Don't overthink it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You've always loved her, and I hope you'll give her the recognition she deserves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all, she's been by your side for so many years. Without her, you could've very easily ended up isolated, maybe even with autism."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's gaze shifted slightly, and he gave a cold, almost mocking smile. "If you really want to give her recognition, why not just do it yourself?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides, isn't my autism exactly what you've always wanted?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew froze, staring at Steven. The young man was so composed and collected, having grown up in a stifling environment and still turned out so successful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew couldn't understand it. It didn't add up in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It reminded him of those kids abandoned by their parents, who, through sheer will, achieved things others could only dream of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was one of those.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anger surged through Andrew. "What the hell are you saying? Steven, how did I raise you? Don't you know how to be grateful?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he saw the rebellious look on Steven's face, fury bubbled up inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You know better than anyone what happened on Queenie's 18th birthday."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew paused, then slammed his hand down on the table. "What the hell are you getting at?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph!" Steven's voice was cold, unfeeling. "It's disgusting even to say it. You know exactly what happened. Now get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wasn't about to let Andrew ruin his evening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a good day, and he had plans to enjoy dinner with Diana before heading home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, something clicked in Andrew's mind. He remembered that night. He'd been drunk and walked into the wrong room, but it seemed like Queenie didn't know about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How do you know?" Andrew was stunned. His eyes widened, and he glared at Steven, his expression suddenly turning lethal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's smile was icy, and his eyes darkened as he replied, "I saw it with my own eyes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You..." Andrew's face twisted with rage. "That was an accident. I thought she was the woman I brought back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Leave!" Steven's voice was sharp, dismissive. He couldn't stand another second of this conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew was seething. "You brat. Don't push me. I'm your father! Why do you always act like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Some things happen when you're drunk, and they can't be avoided. You'd better keep this to yourself and make sure Queenie never finds out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew's words were cold as he issued his final warning, then stormed off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven shut his eyes, pushing the rising anger deep down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana perched on the stairs, watching as Andrew stormed out in a fit of anger. Only after the door slammed behind him did she make her way down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hadn't caught a word of their conversation. Between the distance to the living room and the howling wind outside, it was impossible to hear anything clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she descended, Steven opened his eyes, his usually impenetrable gaze softening the moment he saw her. His voice was low and rough, tinged with exhaustion. "Grandma's asleep?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah," Diana replied, her tone even. "She's resting now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She took a seat across from him, mentally bracing herself for the remaining hours. Dinner with Helen was still ahead, and only after that could she leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Pulling out her phone, she dove into work. Nolan had messaged her with some questions, and she handled them efficiently, her fingers flying across the screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven leaned back, his eyes lingering on her as she worked. The woman who used to hang on his every word and look at him with unshakable devotion seemed like a distant memory now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They sat in silence, the quiet stretching between them until dinnertime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dinner was lavish. Helen had gone all out, bringing in two chefs to prepare the meal. Diana enjoyed the spread thoroughly, savoring the dishes with unreserved delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After dinner, Helen walked them to the door, her warmth evident as she fussed over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, Diana, be careful on your way home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry, Grandma," Steven assured her with a faint smile. "We'll be fine. Go back inside and rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a wave, Helen retreated indoors, leaving them to the quiet of the snowy evening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they got into the car, Diana reached for her seatbelt, but before she could click it in place, Steven leaned over to help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His movement brought him so close that his face brushed against her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The soft, warm sensation froze him in place for a fraction of a second, and the faint fragrance clinging to her skin wrapped around him like a spell. His grip on the seatbelt tightened as he forced himself to focus, his entire body taut with restraint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana blinked, caught off guard, feeling he did that on purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He clicked the seatbelt into place and leaned back, his gaze inadvertently meeting hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her cheeks were flushed a delicate red, her eyes darting away shyly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's heart pounded in her chest, but she quickly masked her embarrassment with annoyance. His overwhelming presence was making it impossible to think straight. Gritting her teeth, she snapped, "I can buckle my own seatbelt, you know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He chuckled softly, his voice low and teasing. "You don't have to. I'm here, so I'll handle the little things."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her expression darkened. "Spare me the chivalry. Back when Queenie was around, you'd always put her in the passenger seat and shove me to the back. I felt like a complete outsider. Honestly, I didn't even want to ride in the same car as you two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're so overbearing. If I refused to get in, you'd call me difficult. But if I agreed, I'd have to sit there and watch the two of you play out your little drama right in front of me. It was disgusting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A shadow crossed Steven's face. The air between them grew heavy with unspoken tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go," he said tersely, his tone clipped. The past was a wound he had no desire to reopen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Satisfied that she'd struck a nerve, Diana fell silent, turning her attention back to her phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The car eased out of the driveway and onto the road, but neither of them noticed the black SUV following a short distance behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The tension in the car was palpable. Steven gripped the wheel tightly, his jaw clenched, while Diana stayed glued to her screen, completely ignoring him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they exited the villa neighborhood, Steven cast her a sideways glance. "You should put your phone away. You'll get carsick."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana, engrossed in her chat with Cecil, barely heard him. Cecil had asked if she had any upcoming plans and mentioned wanting to visit her soon. She said absentmindedly, looking up, "Huh? Did you say something?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="896.html">« Prev</a><a href="898.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
