"Grandpa, I promise you. They forced me to sign divorce papers and a letter of severance. I signed the divorce papers, and he signed them first. We are really divorced."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh! That's a relief. If you were still involved with that bastard, I might have had the urge to kill him," Leopold said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven felt helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold appeared frightened. "Anyway, you've divorced. Let's go and meet that guy. He's really handsome. I'm very satisfied with him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana knew that Leopold had a good eye, so maybe she could really meet him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that thought in mind, Diana smiled and said, "Okay, Grandpa, let's go and meet him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, you can't leave," Paula rushed after her, blocking her path once again. "Diana, Queenie is in a really tough spot right now. I'm begging you, please ask the old lady for help. If you do, she'll keep her hands. With the piano competition coming up&mdash;she can't lose her hands."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Diana heard these words, sadness filled her eyes. Why should she sacrifice herself for Queenie?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Paula, I will never forgive you. You never treat me like family, so why should I care about you?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Didn't you hear Queenie's conversation with Megan at her birthday party? They've schemed against me so many times&mdash;not just once or twice. Last time, she rolled down the stairs herself intentionally when Steven was around, just so she can watch him beat me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And you, you hit me too. There was no camera at the stairs, so she could slander me however she wanted. She played the victim, so I was beaten and scolded!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Paula, I'll never let go of the hurt and humiliation you've brought me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tears slid down Diana's cheek, and she continued. "Queenie has framed me so many times. But I will pay back, little by little."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh, Diana, you've suffered so much. Why didn't you come home? You stubborn girl, come on, let's go. From now on, we'll have nothing to do with these people." Leopold tightened his grip on Diana's hand as they entered the elevator.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia shot a cold glance at Paula. "Madam, you'll regret losing Diana, your real daughter, for the rest of your life."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven furrowed his brows, thinking back to when Queenie fell down the stairs. He had acted impulsively and hit Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't help but get mad when he saw Queenie lying there, covered in blood</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had accompanied him for some time, but that wasn't enough for him to fall in love with her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she hadn't come back, he would've married Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Queenie left for treatment abroad after he lost his sight in that car accident. He couldn't blame Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven tried to convince himself of this, but inside, he felt suffocated and miserable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie had repeatedly crossed the line. Could he still trust her?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's gaze grew even more intense.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula stood there in a daze for a long time before convincing herself. She believed what she saw&mdash;Diana was the liar.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She turned and headed back to help Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Inside the banquet hall, Queenie kept trying to explain to Cecil. "Mr. Farley, I really didn't know it was Diana who saved her. When I got there, I was shocked. But I immediately called for help!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie had a good reputation, and some people stood up for her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Farley, Ms. Marsh is right. Even though she didn't know Diana saved the old lady, she did call for help. Let her off just this once."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil's face was already swollen and burning painfully.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, you were just using me to go after Diana. Don't try to sound so noble. Now make a choice. Your hand or your leg?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fear flickered in Queenie's eyes. She had seen this coming.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She clutched the hem of her dress tightly. Her plan had failed, and she was both furious and terrified, her breath quickening as a murderous look filled her gaze.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="30.html">« Prev</a><a href="32.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
