Mrs. Foliot was in trouble. I saved her this morning. I suspect that Amelie and Mr. Foliot did it. I don't rule out the possibility that they teamed up to kill Mrs. Foliot."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had wanted to remind Lily last night, but Lily had been very busy.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna thought of what had happened at the banquet last night and was shocked. "Diana, aren't they afraid of suspicion if they do this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, "If there is no evidence, even if others suspect them, they can't do anything to them. People like Queenie and Jeff are thick-skinned. As long as there is no evidence, no one can do anything to them."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna knew that people like Queenie would do anything as long as there was profit in it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She drove to catch up with Amelie's car. Jeff and Amelie left together.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna said, "Diana, they're going back home."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew that it was useless to follow them.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "There's no need to follow them."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cell phone rang at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana picked it up and saw that it was Cecil.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, Cecil."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil said, "Diana, read the news. Everyone says that you killed Mrs. Foliot. What's going on? These people are so terrible for spreading rumors."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was shocked. "What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you were in my room last night. How could you kill Mrs. Foliot? Someone wanted to frame you." Cecil's voice was full of worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana tightened her grip on the phone. "Cecil, don't worry. Take care of your company first. I'm afraid they will take advantage of the chaos to do something bad. Please keep an eye on Samuel for me until I have dealt with Mrs. Foliot's affairs."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil said, "Okay! Don't worry. I'll help you keep an eye on that brat."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana then hung up the phone and looked at the news in Capitole.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were two hashtags "Diana killed Mrs. Foliot at night to vent her anger" and "Diana was kicked out of the Marsh family and deliberately took revenge on Queenie by defaming her reputation".</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Below it was Jasmine's self-narration video.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt speechless. She thought, "How could such a reason be tenable?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine said in the video, "Dear netizens, I want to speak up for Queenie today. Diana was born bad. Since the Marsh family found her, she has plotted against Queenie many times. Diana also planned what happened last night. Queenie was a child at the time, and she was innocent.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Instead, Diana targeted Queenie everywhere. Diana had been driven out of the Marsh family because she did something wrong. She lost her status as the Marsh family's adopted daughter, and she couldn't even find a job. Diana was vindictive. She slandered Queenie. Queenie was talented, excellent, and kind. She won various national awards in piano competitions. Now, Queenie plays the leading role in a movie. Diana couldn't bear to see Queenie being better than her, so she wanted to destroy Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was at the scene last night. Those things were done by Queenie's mother and had nothing to do with her. Queenie was still an infant at the time and could not decide her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please support Queenie's movie and support a kind girl."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine then stood up and bowed deeply to the screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Below it were all insults to Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Diana was not a celebrity. Public opinion did not have much impact on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Queenie was Steven's fianc&eacute;e. This identity was enough to make those netizens trample Diana to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Diana, get out of Capitole and pay for Mrs. Foliot's life.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[I know Diana. She is the adopted daughter of the Marsh family. She is vicious. Even her biological mother is unwilling to acknowledge her.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Diana was born bad. Queenie is the princess in my heart. How could a bad woman like Diana target her?]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Diana, if you kill someone, you must pay with your life!]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana coldly looked at the comments insulting her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna also saw the news. She was outraged. "They are going too far."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana narrowed her eyes. She thought, "Queenie did it to clear herself and make her movie a successful release."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Diana dialed Queenie's number.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="685.html">« Prev</a><a href="687.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
