Should I be polite to you?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am killing you? You were the one who first made things difficult for me. Why are you accusing me of killing you? Given your courage to provoke, you should have the nerve to accept the challenge, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How brainless you are!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scolding made Jasmine ignore her pain and stare blankly at Diana.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glared at Queenie and warned icily, "Queenie, dogs can't be fed too much. Otherwise, they will become too ambitious.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I won't endure for anyone. Once I make a compromise, you will become more aggressive. I have reminded you not to mess with me again. I have already stayed away from you. If you provoke me again, your movie really won't be released."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie bit her lip, and her eyes were fierce. She was well aware of what Diana meant.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, why do you speak so harshly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh! Your fart never smells good," Diana smiled coldly. She had never been an elegant lady, and she could never be as weak and helpless as Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you... I just want to advise you to be polite. After all, this is not the kind of remote and poor place in the countryside where you lived before." Queenie deliberately raised her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sneered and glared at her. "If your father hadn't been so heartless as to snatch me away and abandon me secretly, would I have grown up in the countryside? You have taken over my place and become the talented lady of the Marsh family, praised by everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you are really proud of your stolen life and think highly of yourself.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember that your mother was born in the countryside. If I hadn't been replaced by Jeff, your mother would have had to bring you back to the countryside to farm.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, Queenie, let me tell you one last thing. There is no shame in growing up in the countryside. We all earn our living by our own labor and our own hands. It is shameful for arrogant ladies like you to eat the fruits of other people's labor and look down upon others."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie and the crowd were speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They felt that they had all been scolded by Diana, but they had no proof.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily stood up, clapped her hands, and gazed at Diana with a smile. "Diana, you are right. Everyone's ancestors once farmed. Some shameless people disdain others, yet they are bitches."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had a sense of foreboding when Lily defended Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, "Mrs. Foliot, you are right."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily grinned wickedly at Amelie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie noticed it and instantly regretted coming in. She was now eager to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want to be taken revenge on by Lily, who had been arrogant and domineering in her youth. How could she overlook Amelie's affair with Mark?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, before the banquet begins, I would like to show you a video. Please be a witness, so when I divorce my husband, he won't get anything."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="646.html">« Prev</a><a href="648.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
