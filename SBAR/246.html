"Penelope, you're here," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After seeing through the facade, he felt nothing but disgust for this woman. Looking at her over-the-top appearance, he realized how blind he had been.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Penelope had planned to visit Gale earlier, but she ran into a friend who invited her to a hotel. She couldn't indulge often due to her pregnancy, but today she had, and it left her quite satisfied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Pretending to be concerned, Penelope looked at Gale and said, "Gale, I'm sorry for not coming sooner. I was devastated when I heard about your accident, but I was too scared to visit."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's fine. I know my legs are paralyzed now, and I'll be a cripple from now on. But for you and the baby, I've given my shares to Queenie. That was the condition for her to take them. From now on, she'll support you both, and on the 15th of each month, you can collect half the money from her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Penelope, I may be foolish, but I have always been sincere towards you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I have done right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But you should never have made me a scapegoat. I will get my revenge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie, Penelope, and Jeff will all face the consequences."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Penelope was deeply moved by his words, her eyes welling up with tears. She thought she had found the perfect fool, knowing he would take full responsibility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Gale, you're too good to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale's eyes flashed with hatred. "Penelope, just wait. Let's see who has the last laugh."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Penelope, you're carrying my child. Who else would I be good to if not you?" His eyes showed a hint of mockery. "Penelope, just wait. The real show is yet to come."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Overcome with emotion, Penelope leaned against Gale's chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale felt utterly disgusted. His investigation had revealed that Penelope had been with another man at a hotel before coming here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The thought of having been with this woman repulsed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale pushed Penelope away gently but firmly. "Penelope, I'm leaving the country in a couple of days. Remember to collect the money from Queenie on the 15th of each month."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing this, Penelope was relieved. She wouldn't have to take care of a cripple after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thankfully, he was leaving on his own, sparing her the trouble of coming up with an excuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Gale, take care of yourself abroad. The baby and I will be waiting for you. Remember to think of me every day, okay?" Penelope said with a feigned look of longing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Penelope put on a show of reluctant farewell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure! Penelope, I'll miss you. You take good care of yourself too." Gale's smile was warm, but his eyes were icy. Blinded by money, Penelope didn't notice the coldness in his gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale nodded slightly, saying nothing more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Disgusted by the smell in the room, Penelope said, "Gale, being pregnant makes me sensitive to smells... I can't handle this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I understand. Go back then. I'm leaving tomorrow, so take good care of yourself," Gale said with a faint smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright! I'll see you off at the airport tomorrow," Penelope replied, keeping up appearances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need. My mom will send someone with me. Don't worry. Just focus on the baby. Make sure to give me a healthy son. My future depends on him," Gale said seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale's tone was firm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Penelope was relieved. This fool would raise her son for her. What a joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright then, Gale. I'll be waiting for you." Penelope left after saying this, pleased with the idea that this fool would raise her child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Penelope left beaming with happiness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale's eyes were cruel as he watched her leave.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="245.html">« Prev</a><a href="247.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
