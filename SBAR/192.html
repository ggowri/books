The woman looked familiar, as if she had seen her before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had seen her in her past life, but she was sure she hadn't met her in this one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna said, "Ms. Bishop, her name is Felicity Aniston. She's the CEO of Simmons Group, one of Cecil's business partners. You've met her before and even signed a contract with her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana closed her eyes. That name seemed familiar, too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Where had she heard it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She couldn't remember for the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana closed her eyes in pain, the agony of her past life resurfacing in vivid flashes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She frowned and said, "Luna, I need an hour of sleep. Make sure to wake me up on time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Once her mind was clear, she would think again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna felt sorry for her. Seeing Diana's pale face, she tried to persuade her, "Ms. Bishop, don't go out today. You're pale. If you keep this up, your body won't hold out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana smiled faintly and shook her head indifferently. "Luna, you don't understand. The best way to respect life is to spend each day doing meaningful things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Time is too short, the gaps between our fingers too wide. Don't waste your prime years and let your best self down."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna thought Diana was hurting over Steven, so she said, "Diana, there's a cure in life called forgetting. Just forget all the sorrows and pain, and only remember the happy moments."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven was just one man, after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There were countless good men in the world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There was really no need to be sad over one Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna didn't know that Diana wasn't sad over Steven anymore; she just wanted to live peacefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana knew Luna didn't understand her feelings. She took a deep breath and smiled lightly. "Luna, I don't ask for much now. I want peace, a stable life, and things to go smoothly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But life seems far from smooth. Even without any wind, the waves are three feet high. Even if I divorce and leave the Marsh family, those people still won't let me go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After saying this, Diana closed her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna clenched her fists. "Queenie is such a vicious woman. She deserves to pay!" she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">An hour later, Diana woke up on her own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After taking her medicine, she slept again and felt much better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana went to the bathroom, then headed downstairs to the first floor with Luna.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil was already waiting in the first-floor lobby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After returning, Cecil had changed into a casual suit. His hair was thick, and his alluring eyes radiated charm enough to make anyone fall for him at a glance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana walked over with a smile. "Mr. Farley, you're quite punctual."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil's mischievous smile faded, replaced by a meaningful one. "If you invited me, how could I not be on time?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana didn't waste words and handed him Felicity's information. "This woman leads one of the companies that took your collaboration. We're going to investigate her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Use every method possible to dig into her background. We need to find out if Queenie is the one behind her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil had seen the woman before. "Felicity? I saw her at a banquet once. She's just the company's CEO. No one knows who the real boss behind the scenes is."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana frowned, still trying to recall where she had heard that name before.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="191.html">« Prev</a><a href="193.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
