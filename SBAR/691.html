What's wrong?" asked Queenie, pretending to be aggrieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine was still at a loss when she heard Queenie's confident voice. "Queenie, please help me. I want to see Cecil and Steven. How could they suppress my family's company for Diana and make my family bankrupt?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I like Cecil so much, and I even proposed to my parents to marry him. Why did he suppress the Staggs family for Diana and bankrupt our family? Queenie, my family went bankrupt because of me helping you. Do you know that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was shocked. "Your family went bankrupt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine cried and said, "Yes. My family went bankrupt. We have to mortgage our house. My parents think I am vicious because it is me that caused our family to go bankrupt. It is because I helped you to clarify yourself.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, you need to produce evidence to incriminate Diana. You have to prove that you are innocent and that I am not wrong. Only in this way can my family be revived, Queenie."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie sneered, "Jasmine, since it's the Farley family who did it, bear with it. I can't help you. Diana and Cecil have always had a good relationship. I can't do anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine was startled. Her beautiful eyes gradually widened. "Queenie, you have been using me, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was speechless. "Jasmine, I didn't use you. I just spoke out my grievances in front of you. You were willing to clarify for me. I didn't do those things. Everything was done by Diana. I am not wrong."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine suddenly came to her senses. She thought, "Queenie is extremely shameless."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only now did Jasmine realize that Queenie had never asked her to do anything, and she was the one who wanted to help Queenie clarify things unilaterally.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just did it on her own initiative.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If something went wrong, Queenie could clear herself of all the blame. But Jasmine would go to hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine couldn't hear clearly what Queenie said. She fell to the ground, motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Brad and Moira heard the noise, they ran over and saw Jasmine fainted on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad looked at Moira and asked, "Is it too cruel for our daughter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moira shook her head, her face full of tears. She whispered, "Cruel? If we don't treat her cruelly once, she will never grow up. Queenie's matter is evident to everyone. Queenie used Jasmine, but Queenie could clear herself of all charges. The Staggs family will die even more miserably. The current situation is pretty good. Although the company has stabilized, it is bankrupt in Jasmine's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what, she is my daughter. No matter how bad she is, she is still my daughter. It is my fault that I did not teach her well. I will leave the company's affairs to you and help her grow up. This time, I will personally help her grow up, supervise her, and let her be a good person."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad expressed his approval of Moira's approach. "I see. Let's leave here and live in another city, away from Jasmine's friends. They only know how to have fun. Our daughter will get better."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "No amount of money is as important as my daughter's life."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad immediately made a decision and thought that they might live a better life if they left this city.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moira was worried about Lily. She said tearfully, "Lily and I are good friends. She called me last night to remind me to be careful of Queenie. But I had no time to prepare, and something indeed happened today.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, Lily exposed the affair between Jeff, Amelie, and Mark. I didn't expect her to get into trouble so soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad was shocked, saying, "The murderer is Diana. Hasn't she been caught?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Could it have been someone else?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="690.html">« Prev</a><a href="692.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
