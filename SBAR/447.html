Even I'm not senile yet, so how could you have dementia?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There's nothing there at all. How could your grandfather be here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracey smacked Jeff on the head, trying to snap him out of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Jeff kept backing away, his eyes filled with terror. "Grandpa, don't come any closer! Stop wearing that creepy long robe. If you want to visit me, at least put on something less frightening. You're scaring me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He continued retreating in panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracey was stunned!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric froze. "What happened to Dad?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grandma, what's wrong with Dad? Why is he acting so unstable?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric stared at his father in horror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracey spoke with heartbreak. "Eric, the doctors say your father has dementia. With his high blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar, he's been fainting frequently and forgetting what he's doing. These past couple days, he can't even control his bladder and bowels. He just turned fifty - how could he have dementia already?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, my poor son, what are we going to do?" Tracey wailed, beating her chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric was left speechless, his jaw hanging open.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dad, there's nothing there, and definitely no great-grandpa."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Shut up, you worthless piece of trash! Why couldn't you have died out there? You're in my way! All four of you brothers need to die."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff slapped Eric hard across the face, his eyes wild with rage and terror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric stood there stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracey was horrified. "How could he say such things?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric was her grandson, too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sure, Paula could die. That little witch Diana could die. But she couldn't bear the thought of her four grandsons!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dad... what... what did you just say?" Eric touched his stinging cheek, staring at his father in disbelief. His father had just wished death upon all four brothers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff suddenly seemed to realize what he'd said and quickly backtracked. "What are you talking about? Did I say something? I don't remember saying anything just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, make grandpa leave! He's standing right in front of me! I'm scared, I'm so scared! He says he's going to strangle me, says he's too lonely over there."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff kept backing away, frantically waving his hands in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracey ran to the kitchen, grabbed a handful of water, and threw it at Jeff while shouting. "Evil spirits begone! Return to where you came from, leave us in peace!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the entrance, Paula watched the frenzied Jeff with a hint of mockery in her eyes. "Jeff, so that woman's next? You star-crossed lovers won't need to sneak around anymore. I'll make sure you're chained together forever."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula's eyes darkened as she turned and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Diana got home, she received a video from the housekeeper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Watching the video and hearing Eric's words, a murderous glint flashed in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What happened to Jeff was Paula giving him a taste of his own medicine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Jeff's agonized state, she knew the drug had hallucinogenic effects. It was colorless, odorless, and undetectable by hospitals.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Eric was pure evil by nature. For him, she would show no mercy in her retaliation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After transferring money to her contact, Diana took a shower and went to bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Early the following day, Elroy called, asking her to handle some paperwork.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Diana approached the Bureau's entrance, Eric blocked her path. "Diana, stop right there."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="446.html">« Prev</a><a href="448.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
