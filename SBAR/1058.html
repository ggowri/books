Whatever Queenie said, he would take it at face value.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph..." He let out a cold laugh, "I knew that bumpkin stirring up trouble. She came back, and now she's turned </span><span>us</span><span> upside down. Queenie, just wait. I'm heading to the office today. She won't get away with this."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie secretly reveled in Dylan's thoughts. "Alright, Dylan. Just be careful. Diana's really good at calling the cops. If you get detained again, it might not be so easy to get out this time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew it was time to bring Dylan's thug friends into play. Those lowlifes were exactly what she needed to make Diana's life a living hell.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She stir</span><span>red</span><span> the pot. "Dylan, I remember you </span><span>got</span><span> a few </span><span>&hellip;</span><span>special </span><span>friends. You can't handle Diana on your own, especially with those bodyguards always around her. Take a few guys with you. It'll keep you safe and save me the worry."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm more worried Diana might pull some tricks, just a precaution."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan pondered for a moment, "Queenie, I </span><span>almost forgot</span><span> those friends. Alright. I'll talk to them. </span><span>M</span><span>ake sure Diana hands the company back. I'm her brother, she has to listen to me. But those guys, they only care about money, need to pay them afterward."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No problem!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie agreed readily. She never expected Dylan to actually take back the company. His childish antics might embarrass Diana for a while, but they wouldn't cause any real damage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She just enjoyed watching Diana's life turn into a complete mess.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Besides, Queenie was also using this time to work on her romantic pursuits.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After months together, she finally saw through George. He was useless at work and even less worthy of her trust in life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie figured she might as well just live in the moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why bother with forever?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the living room, Diana and the others had been discussing for ages, but they still couldn&rsquo;t come up with a perfect solution.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew all too well that a cunning woman like Queenie would never easily reveal the company&rsquo;s hand. All they could see was the facade.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their only option was to find a powerful company to feign collaboration and uncover all of Queenie&rsquo;s secrets.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, a sudden idea struck Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven offered a suggestion too, but she didn&rsquo;t trust him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She worried Steven might still be hung up on the past and betray her again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Diana hesitate, Steven ask</span><span>ed</span><span>, "Diana, you think my plan won&rsquo;t work?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana gave a faint smile. "</span><span>Well</span><span>, </span><span>truly</span><span> smarter. I can&rsquo;t compare</span><span> to your </span><span>business experience. But I don&rsquo;t trust you. What if you still have feelings for Queenie? </span><span>Betraying me again?</span><span> </span><span>So</span><span>, you go ahead with your</span><span>s</span><span>, and I&rsquo;ll stick to mine."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the distrust, Steven&rsquo;s gaze gradually dimmed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He lowered his head, staying silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They spent ten minutes discussing, but nothing progressed. So Steven waited for Diana&rsquo;s second plan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana turned to Luna and said, "</span><span>S</span><span>end me Aiden's photo</span><span>.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna asked, puzzled, "Diana, why suddenly want his photo?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana laughed, "He's graduating and coming back soon, and Queenie has never seen him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna seemed to catch Diana's drift, so she immediately asked Aiden to send over a selfie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, this is </span><span>it</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana took the phone, her eyes lit up. "Not bad. </span><span>F</span><span>inally grown up, looking more and more like a CEO. </span><span>E</span><span>xactly Queenie&rsquo;s type. Give him the best-performing overseas branch, and appoint him as the Executive President. Once he's back, he'll be in charge of attracting investments."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The domestic market is already saturated. Aside from emerging industries, Queenie will definitely look for other opportunities. Aiden's appearance makes perfect sense and won't raise any suspicion."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven tilted his head to the photo. The man dressed sharply in a suit, did indeed look like a business elite.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His features were sharp, his gaze gentle&mdash;exactly the type Queenie was drawn to.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In contrast, Steven was cold and reserved, never the type Queenie liked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was well aware of Queenie's pretentious displays of affection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "Alright, it's settled. Let me know if you need me to cooperate."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He decided to leave everything to Diana, as long as it made her happy. No matter what happened, he would always be there to protect her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had promised to always be her support.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at Luna and Evan and said, "Let's settle it this way. You two should split up."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Evan, make sure you're disguised when you go out. Queenie and George must not find out you're still alive."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan said with determination, "Got it, Mrs. Gellar."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana turned to Steven and said, "From what I've observed, even though you and George look identical, your abilities are worlds apart."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie? She's dream</span><span>ed</span><span> of being a business queen. If George is dumb enough, </span><span>she</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>ll kick him out</span><span> sooner or later."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven </span><span>felt</span><span> a strange sense of satisfaction as he heard that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright. And then?" he pressed further.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled at him and said, "And then? Just keep doing your thing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's eyes dimmed with disappointment, while the others struggled to hold back their laughter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna asked, "Diana, what are we going to do about Dylan? </span><span>L</span><span>et him run wild? He's reckless, constantly pushing the limits of the law. We can't let him go unchecked, or he'll cause a disaster sooner or later."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smirked dismissively. "The more extreme he gets, the better. Isn't this the perfect opportunity? I'm just waiting for him to walk right into the trap."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With his arrogant personality, he'll definitely try to force me to hand the company back to Steven. In his eyes, Queenie and Steven are the perfect match. He'll make a big deal out of it, maybe even come after me. And that's exactly when I'll take him down."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana turned to Nick and said, "Have security ease up a bit these days. Let some strangers get close to me. We need to give them a chance, make my grand entrance as the victor, right?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1057.html">« Prev</a><a href="1059.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
