"Jean, your mom's doing fine now, but she'll never want you back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I agreed to your mom's request today because I want to tell you something. Your mom was hard on you, but it was because she wanted you to succeed. She pushed you to get into a good university, but you, you're just interested in living a life of luxury."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jean felt a sharp pain in her chest like she couldn't breathe, and tears threatened to spill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew, more than anyone, who had really cared for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But her mother's strictness had pushed her to find comfort in Amelie, and that was why she had ended up there. Her mother had been tough because she wanted them to be independent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shame washed over Jean as she lowered her head, silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula continued, her voice full of regret. "My relationship with my own daughter is the opposite. I've been cruel to her. When she came back to me, I barely gave her any kindness. I resented her for not being able to do anything right, for embarrassing me. But she's actually brilliant and kind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I couldn't see it, though. Instead, I doted on the daughter of the mistress, lavishing her with all my love. For twenty years, I've given everything to her. And when my daughter needed me, I only said the cruelest things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just like the things you've said to your mom, wishing she'd disappear from your life. You only wanted love from your father's mistress, and in that way, we're the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I gave all my attention to the mistress' daughter because she was my precious, the one I raised with my own hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But I couldn't even buy my biological daughter a new dress, nor let her beauty surpass that of the mistress' daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I never cared for her properly, even though I knew she needed a mother's love. I ignored her, time and time again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Maybe I thought she couldn't live without me, that she'd always cling to me. When she and Queenie fought, we always sided with Queenie, hurting her. But Diana always stepped back, making it so easy for me to be her mother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula's mind replayed the image of Diana, quiet, holding everything in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tears spilled from her eyes. "My daughter, she begged for my love. I could see the longing in her eyes, like a hurt little deer. It breaks my heart every time I think of it. But I, her mother, couldn't give her any love. She tried so hard to get close to me, to find warmth in my actions, but I ignored her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She cried alone in the dark, and I pretended not to notice. In the end, my indulgence toward Queenie, and my coldness toward Diana, broke her heart. She signed a severance letter, and from that moment on, she never recognized me as her mother. Now, whenever I think about how resolute she was, it feels like a knife to my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, Jean, do you understand how lucky you are to have a mother who loves you? I think you've really experienced what true maternal love is.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're an adult now, and deep down, you know who's always had your best interests at heart. But your pride won't let you admit it, and you're too stubborn to admit that you've made the wrong choice. It's a shame, Jean. A simple, healthy life is the happiest one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The more Paula spoke, the more sorrowful she became. She realized it all too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She coughed violently, as if her lungs were about to collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Barnes..." Jean could barely get the words out, her voice trembling. "Are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jean felt nothing but regret, but it was too late. Her mother would never want her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had never imagined that a mother could hurt her own daughter like this, and that a daughter could break her mother's heart so completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tears streamed down Jean's face as she sobbed uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula shook her head. "Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She took a deep breath, trying to ease the discomfort in her body, but the taste of blood in her throat made her feel worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She remembered how, when she was sick, Diana used to prepare her medicine. It always worked so well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had never realized Diana had medical skills. She always thought the medicine was from a doctor, but now she understood just how skilled Diana really was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jean clenched her teeth, glaring at Amelie's villa with a flash of hatred in her eyes. She would make Amelie pay for everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Amelie had been kind to her and her brother, letting them live carelessly, all to turn them into spoiled brats, so her son could inherit everything from Mark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for Mark marrying Lily, it was all about the family's wealth and connections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once Jean realized all of this, her throat tightened painfully, and she could barely breathe. She wanted to tell Lily that she was wrong, that she regretted everything. But she knew it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lily had already heard the most hurtful words, and they came from her own daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She understood now. Lily would never forgive her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jean buried her face in her hands and cried bitterly, while Paula just stood there, unmoved by her sobs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone had to face the consequences of their own choices.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After dropping Jean off, Paula made her way to the hospital to stay with Gale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the entire drive, she couldn't shake the uneasy feeling in her gut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, she thought of Diana. She couldn't help but feel that something was wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She called Diana multiple times, but every call went unanswered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula knew Diana was purposely avoiding her. She'd tried calling from different numbers, sending messages, but nothing ever got through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But tonight, she couldn't shake the anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When she arrived at the hospital, her mind was still in a whirl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as she walked into the room, she saw Gale lying on the bed, clearly in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Gale," she said, rushing over to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had just had surgery the night before, and the pain was excruciating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tears welled up in his eyes when he saw her. "Mom, do you think my leg will be okay?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I just want to stand again... to see Althea... maybe even meet my child."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted so badly to apologize to Althea, to make things right, to meet his child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula hesitated for a moment, then sat on the edge of his bed, speaking gently. "Gale, focus on getting better first. We'll worry about everything else later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Althea had already given up on him. She had every reason to after everything he'd done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay, Mom. Do you know where Althea is? Can you find out for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula did know where Althea was staying. But she had to crush her son's last hope. "Gale, even if you know where she is, she's not yours anymore. The child isn't yours either. You can visit, but don't bother her. The damage you did to her is too deep, and she won't forgive you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If she was ever going to forgive you, she would've told you about the baby herself. You shouldn't have found out from someone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now that you know you have a son, it's time to change that prideful attitude. You need to be a strong support for your child. When your leg heals, go see Althea. Talk things through with her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale's eyes filled with tears. Holding onto the last bit of hope, he asked, "Mom... do you think Althea will ever forgive me?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="899.html">« Prev</a><a href="901.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
