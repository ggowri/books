"Wyatt, are you out of your mind? You want&nbsp;me&nbsp;to apologize to her? Who does Diana think she is? Does she even deserve my apology?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would rather die than apologize to Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People had always sucked up to her; she had never apologized to anyone before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was wealthy and powerful. Why should she lower herself to apologize to a mere girl?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn't it Diana who should be coming to her to resolve things?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why was she the one being forced to </span><span>compromise</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt watched her arrogance with a cold smile and said flatly, "You don't have to go, but only if you're okay with letting Samuel rot in jail. When asking for favors, you need the right attitude. Think about what you've done. Sure, having money, status, and power is impressive, but it depends on who you deal with."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana is all alone; she can risk everything. Can you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Courtney paused. She had always thought Diana's loneliness made her easy prey, which was why she had threatened her. But Diana wasn't playing along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, how could you ask me to apologize? You should go instead. You know I've never apologized to anyone. What if I lose my temper and drive Diana away?" Courtney protested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't stand her lowly status, acting all high and mighty in front of me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what, Courtney refused to apologize to Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Wyatt let out an angry laugh, disgusted by her arrogance. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Courtney, how can you even say that? You're living off the wealth accumulated by your family's generations, while Diana is a design director whose work sold exceptionally well this quarter. After collaborating with the Powell family, her company's sales increased by 30% this month."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's an impressive feat. How could you see her as beneath you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All you know is how to enjoy life. It's this underestimating attitude of yours that landed Samuel in jail. If he doesn't get out, I'll divorce you. Let's see if the Marsh family will take you back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who couldn't </span><span>make a </span><span>threat?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt was a master of </span><span>that</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Courtney was stunned, her eyes filled with pain. This man, was he capable of anything but using her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wyatt, for Samuel's sake, I'll go ask Diana for help," she said at last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana met with the arrogant Samuel at the police station.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confident that his parents would go to any lengths to save him, Samuel assumed Diana was there to sign a letter of forgiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, good thing you got here quickly. If you'd been a little later, I still wouldn't have let you off after getting out," Samuel taunted, his arrogance annoying the officers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sit down! How dare you threaten someone in a police station?" the officer scolded, his tone tempered due to Samuel's status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel shot the officer a cold glare but remained silent, his gaze fixed darkly on Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Write the letter of forgiveness. You're fine anyway, so don't demand too much. I know you're broke, but I'll make sure the medical expenses are fully covered so you won't badmouth my family later," Samuel said with a wicked grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Samuel seemed convinced that Diana was there to sign the letter. He wore an unbuttoned black jacket and sat with his legs swinging slightly, giving off a rebellious vibe.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="493.html">« Prev</a><a href="495.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
