He was finally a real man now. He finally understood why men at the club couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t resist chasing women. It was addictive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, the mood was just right the other night. So, we ended up spending the night together."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan smiled, radiating happiness and a hint of smugness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the happiness written all over his face, Steven smiled slightly. "Evan, congratulations on getting what you wanted."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan looked at him and smiled. He was genuinely feeling happier by the day. Judging by the situation, it seemed Steven would soon get what he wanted too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, the deeper you love, the more cautious you become, the more you care about their feelings. Right now, you're just like Mrs. Gellar back then. She loved you so deeply, it made her feel insecure."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But don't be like that. Love can show itself in so many ways. Be yourself&mdash;that's the version of you Mrs. Gellar loves the most."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven froze for a moment. Thinking of Diana's angry expression earlier, he quickly stood up and headed upstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hadn't even finished speaking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching Steven's retreating figure, Evan hoped he'd show some backbone. Women love someone who's both charming and warm, yet genuinely sincere.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan said, "Mr. Gellar, don't act rashly. Women need to be coaxed. Sweet words, gifts, promises, dates&mdash;these can all make a woman happy. Women are meant to be cherished, never hurt."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan said loudly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not far away, Luna was utterly speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words sounded nice.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Women are meant to be cherished, not hurt.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But how many men in this world truly understand that?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some men do understand this. But how many can actually avoid hurting women?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan turned and jogged over to Luna, grabbing her delicate hand. Her hand was slender and soft, yet deceptively strong&mdash;it packed quite a punch.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said gently, "Luna, no plans tonight. Let me take you to a hot spring resort."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna didn</span><span>'</span><span>t buy his sudden kindness. Taking her to a hot spring resort? Yeah, right.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not going. Don</span><span>'</span><span>t think I don</span><span>'</span><span>t know what</span><span>'</span><span>s going on in that scheming head of yours."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan's smile grew even softer. "I miss you. So much."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna, fuming, glared at him. "Save your sweet talk for someone else."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan looked genuinely hurt. He gently squeezed her hand. "Luna, this isn</span><span>'</span><span>t sweet talk&mdash;it</span><span>'</span><span>s romance. We</span><span>'</span><span>re a couple in love. This is our happiest time, and it</span><span>'</span><span>s only going to get better."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna didn</span><span>'</span><span>t know how to respond.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing his pitiful expression, her heart softened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But Diana and Steven..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan cut her off with a grin. "Luna, don</span><span>'</span><span>t you get it? Mr. Gellar finally figured it out tonight. They don</span><span>'</span><span>t need us here anymore. Let</span><span>'</span><span>s go enjoy our own little world and let them have theirs."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna blushed and smiled shyly, eventually following him out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After heading upstairs, Diana settled on the couch with a novel in hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Forceful Love for His Wife."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a novel Luna had given Diana to pass the time, and it was quite entertaining.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven pushed the door open and saw Diana sitting on the couch, engrossed in her novel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The cover was purple. He glanced at the title of the novel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Forceful Love for His Wife."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Could it be that Diana had a thing for domineering men?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Evan had told him to just be himself. Diana liked him for who he truly was.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan was right about one thing. The deeper you love, the more you care about their feelings, and the more cautious you become. Whenever Diana got upset, he couldn't help but feel on edge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven sat beside her, leaning in close. Lowering his gaze, he started reading the novel with her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glanced at him. "Don</span><span>'</span><span>t you have anything better to do?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven locked eyes with her, his gaze intense. "I do! Chasing you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was utterly speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She ignored him and went back to reading her novel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven started reading along with her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The novel went like this</span><span>&mdash;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Catalina, I love you so much. Would it kill you to love me back?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catalina turned around, her eyes filled with sorrow. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jason, what makes you think that after you hurt me so deeply, I could ever forgive you, let alone love you again?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jason grabbed her hand suddenly, pulling her into his arms. His voice was soft, almost pleading. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Catalina, I've explained it to you so many times. It was all a misunderstanding. I'll spend my entire life making it up to you. Please, don't leave. I'm begging you." His tone was heartbreakingly humble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catalina's gaze faltered. She froze, staring at the utterly humbled Jason. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her memory, the Jason she knew&mdash;always commanding and untouchable&mdash;had never been this vulnerable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It took Catalina a long moment to snap out of it. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jason, just because you say it</span><span>'</span><span>s a misunderstanding, does that make it true? Can we really go back to the way things were?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it!" Jason's temper flared instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He kicked the trash can nearby.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catalina snapped, "Why are you kicking the trash can? What did it ever do to you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jason let out a cold laugh. "It was in my way. It shouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t have been here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jason grew even angrier. "Am I less important than a damn trash can?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catalina fumed, "Jason, are you out of your mind?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes! I</span><span>'</span><span>m out of my mind. Just figuring that out today? It</span><span>'</span><span>s all because of you. You</span><span>'</span><span>ve driven me insane. Because of you, I</span><span>'</span><span>m a wreck. Because of you, I nearly lost my life. I did everything for you, and yet you</span><span>'</span><span>re still leaving."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Catalina, do you even have a heart?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jason broke down in tears. He tilted his head back, staring at the blinding sunlight, refusing to admit he was crying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catalina cried too. Her heart ached. After all the pain they</span><span>'</span><span>d been through, why did it take so long to realize it was all a misunderstanding?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The misunderstanding was cleared, but the pain lingered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt like he was the protagonist of a novel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He snatched the novel right out of Diana's hands.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glared at him, annoyed. "Why are you grabbing my book?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven didn</span><span>'</span><span>t respond. He flipped straight to the last page of the novel.  </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, the couple reconciled. Jason and Catalina even had a grand wedding.  </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eventually, they had twins.  </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, they grew old together, surrounded by children and grandchildren.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing such a perfect ending, Steven handed the book back to Diana.  </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His mood had significantly improved.  </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Here, honey, keep reading!" he said with a grin.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shot him a suspicious glance.  </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It only took him a minute to read an entire novel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He skipped straight from the first page to the final ending.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She flipped straight to the ending herself.  </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing it was a perfect happy ending, she lost interest in reading further.  </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Earlier, she had cried over the heartbreak, only for Catalina to forgive Jason in the end.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, did Steven think they could have a happy ending just like the couple in the book?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at him with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven didn</span><span>'</span><span>t look away, meeting her gaze calmly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought Evan was absolutely right.  </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All he needed to do was be himself, cherish her, love her.  </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One day, they</span><span>'</span><span>d find their way to each other.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana suddenly grew intrigued.  </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a playful smile, she asked, "Steven, are you dying for me to forgive you?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1130.html">« Prev</a><a href="1132.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
