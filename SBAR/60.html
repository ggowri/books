Soon, three people appeared on the screen. It was Queenie and the two men in front of her. "Here's a million dollars, split it between you two. You have to do something. Cecil has been investigating the matter of their bodyguard recently. If he comes to you, you tell Cecil that all of this was planned by Diana. This way, not only will we be cleared of suspicion, but we can also change the testimony from that night. I want that old lady to say it was me who saved her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's face turned ashen.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How could this be? How did Diana have the video?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No... it wasn't me. Diana, you're framing me! Why are you framing me? Who made such a realistic video? Diana, are you trying to kill me?" Queenie immediately turned her accusations towards Diana, shouting in agony.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at her grotesque face and felt disgusted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She moved away from Queenie, and Steven took a few steps back unconsciously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie realized her loss of composure and stopped abruptly, glaring fiercely at Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff stood up in anger. "Diana, have you had enough? You two are sisters..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who says I'm her sister? Jeff, I dare not be sisters with such a vicious woman," Diana interrupted him with a laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You two are really united. Queenie made a mistake, and you were the first to stand up and put the blame on me. This has happened countless times. I told you at the last party that I will not allow you to bully me anymore. I will fight back fiercely every time you bully me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff was speechless. He realized that Diana had really changed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stammered, "Diana, what are you talking about? Where did you get the video to frame Queenie like this?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well, since you say I'm framing her, then I'll hand over all the evidence to the police for investigation. I believe the call records between her and these two men will be very interesting."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glanced at Queenie with an indifferent look in her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie sat on the ground in horror. She couldn't go to jail.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she had a criminal record, the Gellar family would never accept her marrying Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought jealously, "Damn it! I'm also Dad's daughter. Why can't I marry Steven as the daughter of the Marsh family? Why am I the illegitimate child, the adopted daughter that no one wants to see?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's not true, Diana, why are you framing me? What have I done to you? You took my Steven and my parents. Why are you still so ruthless to me? I just want someone to care about me." Queenie cried her heart out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven couldn't bear to see Queenie in pain. He helped Queenie stand up and looked at Diana, asking, "Diana, I'll ask you one last time. Did you frame Queenie?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at him as if he were an idiot.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She really wanted to curse him with the most wicked words in the world.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it, you fool! How could I have been married to him for two years?" Diana felt like crying from anger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil finally couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, how unlucky are you to be married to such a simp. The evidence is right in front of him, and he still doesn't believe it. You must have suffered a lot before." Cecil looked at Steven with a smirk.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's face turned pale with anger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana took a deep breath to suppress her emotions. Strangely, she didn't feel heartbroken.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She only felt angry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Cecil, don't go too far." Steven glared at him with a warning look.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Too far? You let her hurt my bodyguard and my grandmother, and now you say I'm going too far?" Cecil's charming eyes were filled with contempt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil raised the USB drive in his hand. "I also have evidence here that will make sure she never gets out of prison once she's in. Are you sure you want to keep protecting her?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil smiled eerily, glancing at Diana, who looked composed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at the USB drive in his hand and was speechless. It was the evidence she had sent to him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was not time to bring it out yet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie leaned against Steven, looking miserable. "Steven, it was not me, really! I couldn't possibly have the ability to do such a thing. I didn't do it. I really don't know why Diana is framing me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sneered, "Mr. Farley, didn't you call the police? Where are the police? Call the police to find out the truth. Since these people can't tell right from wrong, then let all the netizens see whether this matter is true or false." </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Queenie heard that Diana insisted on calling the police, she was really frightened.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie thought, "How could Diana have the confidence to go against Steven?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why would she dare go against the Marsh family?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil walked over and stood next to Diana, smiling, "Diana, don't worry. I'll call the police now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil picked up his cell phone and called the police.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was confused and thought, "Didn't he call the police just now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's eyes flashed. "Cecil, don't the police yet. Tell me what do you want."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil knew that Steven would help Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had become accustomed to Steven's approach.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Diana became numb.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Gellar is willing to give up his money for his love. I want 50% of your family's shares. Use your company to protect your love. Steven, this request shouldn't be too much, right? "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie and Jeff were shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was furious. This was too much.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was not possible.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Cecil, don't go too far. You took away all the money. What should Steven do?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil made such an unreasonable request.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil sneered and looked at Queenie's face, feeling disgusted. "This has nothing to do with me. He is trying to save you. He loves you so much. And you are a priceless treasure in his heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Using all his family's property to save you is an insult to you, but using his life to save you is the most holy love for you. "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie said nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Cecil, Queenie was frightened. No one dared to mess with Cecil, who had called himself the bully since he was a child.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Queenie's four brothers dared not mess with him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was a little afraid of Cecil.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was just because Cecil was a bully that he plotted against Rita in the first place. Rita had arranged everything, but it failed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glanced at Cecil, thinking, "He was indeed a bully."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil was eloquent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven knew that Cecil didn't really want to call the police, but had some agenda.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Farley, you can't get my entire family. What do you want?"Steven's deep voice was very charming. </span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="59.html">« Prev</a><a href="61.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
