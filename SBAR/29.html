Steven, I now understand that falling in love with you was the beginning of my own destruction. I will never love you again. I will only focus on loving myself. Now, get out of my way.&quot;</span></span></span></p><p>Steven said, &quot;Diana, please let me finish. Queenie didn&#x27;t mean it...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana cut him off, saying, &quot;Screw you. Not every time was it unintentional on her part. So, I deliberately did it, right? What happens to Queenie has nothing to do with me. It&#x27;s your business how you want to protect her. Why are you coming to me?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">With disdain evident in her eyes, Diana smiled coldly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In her previous life, Steven pushed her down without mercy. Thinking back to that moment, she wanted nothing more than to kill him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She took a deep breath and calmly said, &quot;Oh, I almost forgot. Even if the truth is presented right in front of you, you won&#x27;t believe it. After all, Queenie can do no wrong in your eyes. You believe every word she says and trust her wholeheartedly, so let that match the depth of your affection.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">With that, Diana left.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven stood there, watching her aloof figure. Her cold expression and the words she spoke with a smile caused his heart to ache.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He wanted to apologize for wronging her again, but she no longer wanted to listen.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She was slapped by Cecil, and as her husband, Steven felt that he had failed to protect her. However, when he considered the evidence, he had done nothing.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He truly hadn&#x27;t expected that she wasn&#x27;t the one responsible.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Not far away, Leopold and Olivia observed the scene, applauding cheerfully.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Leopold shed tears of excitement, his voice trembling as he said, &quot;Olivia, my sweet pea has grown up. She is no longer a hopeless romantic, and she finally sees the true nature of that scumbag.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">It had been a long time since Olivia heard someone affectionately call Diana &quot;sweet pea.&quot; It was evident that Leopold truly cared for Diana.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Olivia said, &quot;Sir Bishop, as long as Diana is clear-headed, everything will go smoothly. Don&#x27;t worry. You will live a long life.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Leopold&#x27;s face lit up with a joyful smile.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Olivia, with your words, I feel relieved. I can survive for the time being and have the opportunity to see my sweet pea getting married and having children. I want to be a great-grandfather.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Olivia looked at the tears glistening in the corners of his eyes and felt a pang of sympathy. &quot;Sir Bishop, please don&#x27;t cry. Let&#x27;s go find Diana.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I&#x27;m not crying; I&#x27;m shedding tears of joy,&quot; Leopold insisted.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He refused to admit that he was crying. Nevertheless, he acknowledged that Diana had been amazing during her confrontation with Cecil just now. She was indeed the granddaughter he had trained.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Just as Diana reached the elevator doors, Paula intercepted her. &quot;Diana.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven, who had been about to turn around and leave, stopped.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula hurriedly approached Diana, visibly anxious. &quot;Diana, please save Queenie. Mr. Farley is going to cut off her hands.&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="28.html">« Prev</a><a href="30.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
