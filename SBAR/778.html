From the outset, their marriage had been unfair to Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, he was convinced that Queenie was his savior, and the scales had tipped in her favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie harbored a genuine dislike for him due to his blindness, yet there was an undeniable loyalty and sense of justice that made him willing to place a bit more trust in Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana, innocent in this game, was unwittingly drawn into a snare.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He vividly recalled the two years spent with Diana, during which she had given her heart and soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had selfishly taken advantage of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a torrent of guilt, remorse, and a profound sense of indebtedness overwhelmed his chest, suffocating him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly realized that he was the perpetrator in this tale, clipping Diana's wings and forcing her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The memory of Diana's tears felt like sharp thorns scraping across his burning face.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood, agitated. His expression was marked by guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had let Diana down, squandering the true love she had offered him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's tears and accusations, each drop like a knife, pierced his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana slept peacefully through the night after her bath.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven, however, stayed awake until the wee hours, managing only two hours of sleep in the early morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the hospital, Queenie's anger led her to destroy the cabinet, only to end up paying for the damage and fainting from the stress.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Steven's call, Queenie understood that Diana had quickly found Steven this time, and Steven hadn't ordered those men to harm Diana, prompting him to question Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie finally grasped that her plan had failed and that Steven knew she had sent people to violate Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had to accept that both Diana and Steven were beyond her control.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to accept this truth, she fainted again, waking the next day to find Mario still by her side.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her heart sinking, her eyes brimmed with unshed tears as she clutched at the last vestige of hope. "Mario, hasn't Steven shown up yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario shook his head. "Ms. Marsh, Mr. Gellar hasn't arrived. Perhaps he's just busy..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mario," Queenie interrupted him with a bitter smile. "No need to comfort me. I know he doesn't want to come. Diana won't tolerate my actions anymore. She'll tell Steven everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven no longer believes me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario, seeing her distress, hesitated to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The idea of hypnotizing Steven had been floated long ago. Was she still betting on Steven's love for her?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Marsh, I'll get you some food. What would you like?" Mario asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hungry from skipping dinner last night, Queenie replied, "Get me some oatmeal. You choose the rest. I'm starving. Hurry back."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario nodded. "Alright!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He left in haste, looking slightly disheveled from a night of vigil by Queenie's side. He always cared for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie leaned weakly against the hospital bed. After a while, she reached for her phone on the nightstand, hesitated, and dialed a familiar number.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, why the early call?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie burst into tears. "Paula's company is a shell. All the money I've earned over the years is gone. I need technical help now. You have to find a solution for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, I warned you not to take risks, but you wouldn't listen. Paula has been in business for 30 years. I think she's outplayed you."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="777.html">« Prev</a><a href="779.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
