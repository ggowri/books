Just wondering when I'll get better."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven leaned closer to her. Seeing her pale face, he said tenderly, "Take it easy these next few days. I'll stay home with you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana didn</span><span>'</span><span>t feel like going out anyway. Tomorrow was going to be even colder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright! For now, Queenie won</span><span>'</span><span>t push things too far. Did you call the police station? Has Sandra confessed yet?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven shook his head. "No. Her team admitted it was all their doing. They didn</span><span>'</span><span>t drag Queenie into it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sighed. "Queenie</span><span>'</span><span>s clever. Everyone thinks she</span><span>'</span><span>s the good guy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana gave him a knowing smile, her eyes glinting with hidden meaning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's expression turned uneasy. He, too, had once believed in that woman.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven pushed the thoughts aside. Helping her up, he said, "Let</span><span>'</span><span>s get you back to bed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana refused. "I need to walk. I ate too much."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stayed by her side, walking in circles around the room with her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana chuckled at him. "I</span><span>'</span><span>m the one who overate, not you. Why are you pacing around with me? Go rest. You stayed up all night watching over me&mdash;you must be exhausted."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not tired," Steven replied curtly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He continued walking with her. Nothing brought him more joy than simply being by her side.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a few laps, Diana didn</span><span>'</span><span>t feel like walking anymore. She was still weak from being sick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, I need to lie down. I</span><span>'</span><span>m out of strength," Diana said weakly, her voice frail. Her hands were ice-cold.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven grew anxious. "Diana, maybe we should go to the hospital?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head. "No need, I</span><span>'</span><span>ve already had an IV. A good night</span><span>'</span><span>s sleep, and I</span><span>'</span><span>ll be fine tomorrow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was stubborn, but Steven wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t budge. "No way, you</span><span>'</span><span>re looking worse. I</span><span>'</span><span>m taking you to the hospital now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head, weakly arguing with him. "I</span><span>'</span><span>m not going. Just grab my medicine kit. I</span><span>'</span><span>ll take something first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fine!" Steven carried her back to the room, fetched the medicine kit, and brought in a glass of water.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana leaned against the headboard, her headache returning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She rubbed her forehead, trying to ease the discomfort.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Steven walk in with the medicine kit, she forced herself to perk up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven opened the medicine kit for her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana grabbed some headache pills from the kit. She popped four into her mouth without hesitation. Taking the glass of water Steven handed her, she swallowed them down and returned the glass to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm going to sleep," she said, not waiting for Steven's reply before lying down and closing her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven quietly placed the glass on the nightstand, then tidied up the medicine kit and stored it in the nearby cabinet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Steven heard her steady breathing. Within ten minutes, a thin layer of sweat formed on her forehead. Her sleep was restless, punctuated by occasional murmurs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven frowned. He suspected she was running a fever again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He placed a hand on her forehead. No fever, but she was sweating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Still uneasy, Steven called the doctor back to check on Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The doctor examined Diana and confirmed she was fine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Rich people sure know how to overreact. She's perfectly fine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dragging me out in the middle of the night, messing with my sleep. I'm a doctor&mdash;I keep a strict routine. I'm seriously exhausted."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glanced at Steven's cold, handsome face. "Mr. Gellar, Mrs. Gellar is fine. She's sweating now, which means she'll feel better soon. No need to worry. She's in great health and should recover by morning."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven gave a slight nod, his gaze shifting to Luna. "Luna, arrange a place for him to stay."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna replied, "Got it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna led the doctor away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven didn</span><span>'</span><span>t dare to sleep either. He sat by Diana</span><span>'</span><span>s side, gently wiping away her sweat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By 5 a.m., Diana finally fell into a peaceful sleep, her murmurs fading away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven had a good idea of what haunted her dreams&mdash;her so-called "past life."  </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was beaten, her limbs broken, her face disfigured, and then pushed down the stairs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She kept crying, screaming, begging for mercy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But no one came to save her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the man she loved most, Steven, couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t save her.  </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She watched helplessly as he and their son died right before her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven held Diana tightly, his whole body aching.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was exhausted too. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Holding her close, he drifted off to sleep without realizing it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had been sick for three days.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For those three days, Steven stayed by her side, never leaving her for a moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Members of the Bishop family and the Gellar family took turns visiting her every day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edward and Helen even brought her plenty of nourishing supplements.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For the first time, Diana experienced what it felt like to be surrounded by so much care and love.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Owen, Yanson, Alexander, and Cecil showed up to visit her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was the last to arrive, bringing along plenty of fresh fruit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sat down beside Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was also sitting next to Diana, the two of them close together.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sat stiffly between the two men, her back straight as a board.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was completely unaccustomed to situations like this, and it made her incredibly uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's gaze was gentle as he quietly observed Diana's pale face. "Diana, are you still feeling unwell?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head and smiled. "No, I'm fine. Alexander, I feel much better now. Thank you for coming to see me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wished he would sit a little farther away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Behind her, Steven sat pressed close. His arm wrapped possessively around her waist, staking his claim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven spoke calmly, "Mr. Powell, thank you for visiting my wife. There's coffee prepared for you over there. How about I join you for a cup?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two men locked eyes, each with their own thoughts, yet an undercurrent of hostility simmered beneath the surface.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander reached out and ruffled Diana's hair, the gesture intimate and familiar.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, take care and rest up. I'll come see you again tomorrow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander stood, his gaze darkening. "Mr. Gellar, we're not exactly close enough to share coffee. I'll take my leave now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander strode out without hesitation. Sharing coffee with Steven was never an option.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's tense posture finally relaxed. She turned to Steven. "Don't you think there's something... off about Alexander?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven gazed at her intently. Sometimes, she could be so oblivious&mdash;but maybe it was better she stayed that way.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was simmering with restless energy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Diana wanted a divorce, Alexander was certain it would happen. He had been quietly waiting ever since.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now that the misunderstanding with Diana was cleared up, Alexander couldn't sit still anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That's why he showed up so aggressively, standing uncomfortably close to Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"People change, you know. Alexander might be capable, but Diana, do you really know him?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana froze for a moment. How well did she really know Alexander?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Alexander standing before her was gentle, reserved, and mature. She admired him deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing her silence, Steven pressed on, "He was exiled abroad as a child. In just over a year, he came back and took over the entire Powell family. Do you really think he's a simple man?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1128.html">« Prev</a><a href="1130.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
