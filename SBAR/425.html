You have a great talent for design. If you continue your studies, your future value will be immeasurable."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana sneered, "Why don't you call the principal yourself and see if he's willing to accept me? If he is, I promise I'll go there."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was delighted. "Okay! I'll do it in a moment. I happen to know the principal."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana said, "Mmm. Grandma, let's go upstairs for acupuncture."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mrs. Helen Gellar asked Steven to take care of it, and then she went to a private room with Diana for acupuncture.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven went back to his room to make a call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew the principal of Gaffa Design University. Companies like his would recruit some outstanding designers every year.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was a pity that he failed to recruit the best designer two years ago. Otherwise, his clothing business would have been the best in Capitole long ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hello? Is this Mr. Wilson? I'm Steven Gellar. I want my wife to study at your university. She's an excellent designer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mr. Wilson said, "Mr. Gellar, I didn't expect you to be married. Can I get a file on your wife?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven prepared Diana's personal information and designs early the morning. He returned to the message page and sent the file to the principal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The principal didn't say anything. He clicked on the file to take a look. When he saw the name Diana Bishop, he was stunned. "Does this big shot still need to come to my university for further studies?" he wondered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Gellar, you are joking, right? Two years ago, your wife, Diana, was a doctor of philosophy, the highest degree for designers in our school. She's not only a professional fashion designer, but also a capable jewelry designer. In the field of art, she's had three major strengths of designers. She's also the most famous animation designer, and animation design is a piece of cake for her. We've been inviting her to be a professor in our school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But we never found her. Turns out she married you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Gellar, please stop joking with me. That's just too discouraging. She's the senior designer you were looking for two years ago."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's mind went blank, and his upright body trembled for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Turned out Diana was the designer he'd been looking for two years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So he was too narrow-minded last night and misunderstood Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had never been so shocked before, and he was speechless for a good while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was shocked and pleasantly surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is it so hard to admit that I am excellent?" Diana's words came to his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He suddenly thought of a question, so he asked in confusion, "Mr. Wilson, why couldn't I get this information on her before?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="424.html">« Prev</a><a href="426.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
