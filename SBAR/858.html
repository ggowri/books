He was dressed expensively, had an anxious expression, and was kneeling helplessly in the snow praying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam prayed that someone could save his wife, Carolyn Young, and save his children.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was moved by the way he prayed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, She looked at the doctor opposite her and said, "Doctor, please take care of my friend. I am also a doctor, and I can deliver babies. I will go and take a look."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor didn't want her to get into trouble, nor did he want himself to get into trouble. "Miss, please don't make trouble anymore. Even if you are a doctor, in this snowy place with nothing, how can you help others give birth? If it's a difficult birth, and there is nothing you can do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana explained, "But as doctors, we can not stand by and watch people die without rescuing them, and we certainly can not stand by and watch people die without rescuing them because we are afraid of taking responsibility."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She also understood that many times, her sincere efforts were worthless in the eyes of others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was more, she had lived this life again, experienced many vicissitudes of life, and seen all kinds of things, and her heart had long been as cold as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, if people had good intentions, they could move everyone. Diana believed that there were still many kind people in this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gave the doctor her phone number. "Please send my friend to the hospital for treatment, and I will see the pregnant woman first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor's face was indifferent. "Even if you are a doctor, why do you care about her business? Besides, your friend is also injured, and a family member must go with her to handle the hospitalization procedures, so you can't leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Nolan's voice came. "Diana."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She saw him and pointed at the ambulance. "Nolan, come here quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Diana looked at the doctor again and said, "I'll ask my younger brother to accompany you to the hospital. Please open the door."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that she insisted on her own opinion, the doctor stopped trying to persuade her. Not everyone could afford to suffer a medical accident. It was not that they would not help her but that they were powerless to do anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor opened the car door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana jumped out of the car, and Nolan ran out of breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't find Luna, so she called Nolan and asked him to come over. His car was stuck behind, so he walked to find her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nolan, take Paige to the hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, she walked toward Sam, who was kneeling in the snow. At this moment, he was looking ahead with empty eyes, feeling a kind of despair that was helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, I'm a doctor. Please take me to see your wife."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several car owners around were also excited as they saw Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A lady shouted, "The doctor is here, the doctor is here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Sam heard that Diana was a doctor, he was surprised. "Are...are you really a doctor?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She responded, "Yes! Take me to see your wife first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam stood up excitedly. "Okay, okay, that's great. Please come with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana followed him into the car behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the car, Carolyn had fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Diana saw her flushed face and touched her hot forehead, she had a bad feeling.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="857.html">« Prev</a><a href="859.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
