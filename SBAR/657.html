She lost her company, owes a huge debt, and her husband forced her into a divorce to be with his mistress.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[It's the worst kind of tragedy. She raised a daughter who turned out to be her husband's mistress' child, and her own biological daughter was driven away. Such a convoluted drama can only happen among the wealthy.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every comment was condemning Queenie as an ungrateful ingrate.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a fit of rage, Queenie hurled her phone to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was twisted with anger, veins bulging on her forehead. She never imagined she would be ruined by Lily's machinations.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pain and humiliation coursed through her, and she turned to Jeff, her eyes filled with contempt. "Mom was right all along. You're just a worthless man who can't even protect his own wife and child."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was stunned. The hateful look in Queenie's once-innocent eyes made him uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, how... how could you say that to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie laughed darkly, a cruel smile spreading across her face. "Your whole life, you lived off Paula like a parasite. That's the only reason you ever got anywhere. You're utterly useless."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff's blood pressure spiked, and he looked at her, feeling a crushing sense of betrayal.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything he had done was for her. He had abandoned his four other children and given everything to Queenie and her brother. Yet, here he was, labeled a worthless man.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, I should have known... you're just heartless," Jeff said, his face pale with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh dear, Queenie, what's going on here? How did you manage to upset your father like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tracey entered, looking to collect money. Noticing the intense atmosphere between them, she frowned, feeling that Queenie was once again bullying her son.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Queenie saw Tracey, her frustration grew. "Why is this old woman here?" she thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jeff, are you okay?" Tracey asked, helping him sit down.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff felt irritated and snapped, "Mom, I'm fine. Why are you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tracey pursed her lips, clearly displeased. "How can I not be here? Neither you nor Queenie kept your promises to me. You still haven't given your father and me the one hundred thousand dollars for this month."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And when are you going to let us move in here? Living in that apartment is so inconvenient; waiting for the elevator every day is a nightmare. Living in this villa would be much easier."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Tracey glanced at Queenie, who looked pained.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, you promised me this, so don't go back on your word. I need that one hundred thousand dollars by tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Queenie's anger flared. She shouted, "You Marsh family people are like vampires! The only person foolish enough to give you money to build a villa and hand out one hundred thousand dollars a month in living expenses was Paula. Only an idiot like her would be so generous to such greedy people."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't have any money! Can't you see I'm dealing with a crisis here? Over the years, you've taken tens of millions of dollars. Isn't that enough? You've got one foot in the grave, and all you think about is money. And don't think I don't know that you've been funneling all that money to Uncle's family."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to give him all the money, then go live with them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're shameless, using someone else's hard-earned money to support a son who does nothing but gamble. I won't give you another cent."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tracey panicked at her words. Whoever gave her money was her benefactor.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pointed angrily at Queenie and shouted, "You ungrateful wretch! How dare you speak to me like that! You can't even keep your promises, and you call yourself a dutiful daughter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You worthless brat! Watch out, or I'll sell you off!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="656.html">« Prev</a><a href="658.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
