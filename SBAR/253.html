I'm not planning to take the blame after leaving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I didn't do much. I just exposed Queenie's facade. Gale called to apologize, but I didn't accept it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea smiled. It was a beautiful, gentle smile, yet there was an undeniable strength beneath it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once she made up her mind, she was unlikely to change it easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't love Gale anymore, and she wouldn't, unless a miracle happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You've done well. Seeing your transformation now, I know you have a remarkable future ahead."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea grabbed Diana's hand. "Diana, come on. Let's get something good to eat. The seafood here is fresh. I love the conch and lobster here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The weather will be nice tomorrow, so you can dive and catch lobsters. Don't you love lobster meat? When the tide recedes this season, you can catch lobsters in just one mile of water."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was thrilled and agreed to stay for a few days. Alexander wouldn't be back for a few days anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was the perfect opportunity for her to unwind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a few days, Frank would return, bringing more drama.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea took Diana to the beach night market, which had many food stalls serving fresh seafood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea led Diana to her favorite stall. They ordered a lot of lobsters and grilled fish. The fish here were fresh, caught from the sea earlier that day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The grilled lobster, with no added seasoning, was delicious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many people were having fun on the beach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not far away, a group of men were swimming, wearing only beach shorts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even in the twilight, their broad shoulders, narrow waists, and perfectly sculpted abs and chests were visible, forming ideal V-shaped bodies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They had long legs and healthy, tanned skin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana couldn't help but take a few extra glances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The men on this island were truly a sight to behold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea noticed Diana's captivated expression and laughed. "Those guys are the island's diving instructors. Tomorrow, I'll get one of them to take you diving. He'll help you catch lobsters. If you want any fish, he can get them for you. He's good at spearfishing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana nodded. "Great! I'll stay with you for three days, and I'll come back when you're having your baby."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Good!" Althea was delighted. "By the way, Diana, have you and Steven finalized the divorce papers?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana thought of Steven's reluctance to finalize the divorce and found it baffling. Men's hearts were weird. He wanted the divorce, she agreed, and now he didn't want it anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She shook her head. "We only signed the divorce agreement. The certificate hasn't been filed yet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea looked at her intently and said firmly, "When it comes to you and Steven, I advise splitting, not reconciling."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="252.html">« Prev</a><a href="254.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
