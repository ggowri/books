Her face was pale as she lay on the bed, her chest heaving violently, with eyes full of hatred and despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hated herself for abandoning her own daughter and causing her so much pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More despairingly, her daughter would never forgive her. No matter what she did, her daughter would never resort to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain made her tremble. She broke down, questioning how she, who had always been rational, could have come to this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lived in a dilapidated room where even a slight breeze could cause the windowsill to shake.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, what's wrong?" Eric walked into his mother's room, looking at her with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula, upon seeing her son, burst into tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holding Eric's hand, she choked out. "Eric, I was so foolish. If I had realized the schemes of Jeff and Queenie earlier, we wouldn't have ended up in this situation, and your sister wouldn't hate me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She added, "That time I went to her, I spoke too harshly. Our unconditional favoritism towards Queenie hurt her deeply. She will never forgive us in this lifetime."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana would never forgive her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The former Diana, when faced with injustice, would just bite her lip and say nothing, because no one was willing to listen to her explanations.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even that bastard Steven wouldn't believe her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Queenie cried, everyone would revolve around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula hit the bed in anguish and screamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She really wanted to make amends to Diana, but Diana didn't want her apology. She always thought that Diana was just a wild girl from the countryside, but she never considered that when she was abandoned by that bastard Jeff. Diana was actually the most innocent victim.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finding Diana back, she was indeed worried about being embarrassed, but at that time, Edward liked Diana and wanted her to marry Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't send Diana away; at that time, she thought that sending Diana abroad for studies wouldn't be too embarrassing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could there be a mother who felt ashamed of her own daughter? She was not worthy of being Diana's mother!</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She still remembered what Diana said. At that time, she didn't want to go abroad and said, "Mom, I've already missed you for more than ten years. I want to stay by your side."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, she felt that Diana was not ambitious and only wanted to squander the family's wealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was even reluctant to give Diana pocket money, buying clothes worth just a few hundred dollars for her, while customizing dresses worth millions of dollars for Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Paula thought about it, the more she felt that she was not worthy of being Diana's mother; she truly was not a good mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric, seeing his mother in pain, felt very distressed and said in a low voice, "Mom, don't overthink it. In the future, we will treat our sister well. She will know that we are sincere, and she will forgive us."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also knew he was wrong and didn't even have the face to meet Diana. When something happened to her, he couldn't help because, apart from driving, he had no other skills. No one was willing to do him a favor and save Diana. At this moment, he truly felt how insignificant he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't wasted those dozen or so years on luxury cars and instead spent more time learning how to deal with people, he wouldn't have been at a loss when his sister was taken away by the police.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only after experiencing setbacks did one realize how difficult life could be, but fortunately, he could start over now.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not late for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula shook her head in pain and said, "No, I know her too well. During those two years, she suffered so much at home. We favored Queenie, giving her all the good things, while Diana got all the bad. So, she will never forgive us."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="702.html">« Prev</a><a href="704.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
