Go ahead, tell me," a cold voice came from behind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone froze in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven spun around and saw Diana standing next to Cecil, casually enjoying a piece of cake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A bit of white frosting lingered at the corner of her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil noticed it and gently wiped it off for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven felt a wave of relief upon seeing Diana, but his earlier suspicions made him extremely agitated. He had doubted Diana once again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Watching Cecil's affectionate gesture, Steven's expression grew darker.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie was shocked. "Diana, you... you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Queenie, what's with that look? Were you badmouthing me again in front of everyone?" Diana asked, feigning innocence. Playing the victim was easy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie choked. "I wasn't."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Penelope was overly tense and furious. "Diana, what are you doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana looked confused. "Where else should I be? There was a gust of wind earlier, knocking down the flowers outside. The butler and I were fixing them, and I just came in when I heard you calling my name."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The butler chuckled. "Yes, there was quite a gust earlier. Many of the gift lists at the entrance were blown away, but thankfully, this lady helped."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie and Penelope were stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">So, who was the person inside?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jace, furious, led the group inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When the curtain was pulled back, everyone was shocked by the two people on the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie was especially stunned, her beautiful eyes nearly bulging out, her body trembling uncontrollably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula looked at the absurd scene in front of her. It was Jeff and his childhood sweetheart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie took a shocked step back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jace's face was as dark as it could get.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that moment, he realized he had been used by Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After decades of scheming in the business world, how could he not recognize Queenie's petty trickery?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven turned and headed for the door, not wanting to taint his eyes further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula sneered; this was the perfect opportunity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A prime chance to beat up the mistress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ever since she first saw this woman, Paula had been looking for an opportunity to strike.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now she had found it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She angrily grabbed her chain handbag and walked over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She swung it hard, hitting Jeff on the head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Jeff, you bastard," she yelled in agony.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jeff, who had been fully immersed, winced from the pain. The drug's effects weren't strong, and the hit sobered him up completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing the scene before him, Jeff's mouth dropped open in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Looking at the woman in front of him, he was filled with terror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"H-How... could this be?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Honey... I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula raised her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Slap!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She slapped him hard across the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Slap!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Another slap landed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jeff's head spun from the blows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He still tried to explain anxiously, "Honey, let me explain. I don't know how I got here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula shouted furiously, "You disgraceful jerk! How dare you do this at Mr. Foliot's party? Do you have any respect for him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Queenie is such a kind girl. She almost lost her life saving Mr. Foliot's grandson, and you use that bond to carry out such indecency with another woman here? Do you even respect Mr. Foliot?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula's every word accused Jeff of disrespecting Jace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hearing this, Jeff was overwhelmed with anger. His vision darkened, and he nearly fainted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He couldn't understand why he had been so impulsive earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula's gaze darkened as she looked at the woman cowering under the covers. "Your turn, slut."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula tossed her bag aside and yanked the covers off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing this, Jeff rushed over to stop Paula.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Paula, we were set up, we... we... we..."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="199.html">« Prev</a><a href="201.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
