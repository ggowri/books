But Diana has always been well protected by me. Although she was bullied by you mentally, she is the one who will survive in the end, the ultimate winner."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, this is why I can give you five million dollars a month and eventually take back 500 million from you. Everything comes at a price. The next person to go to hell will be you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Temporary pain can keep Diana alive, and what he always wanted was for her to live.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now Diana is alive, but Queenie and George must pay with their lives for their child!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven wants to avenge his son.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie laughed and said, "Steven, as long as I'm alive, Diana can never be the final winner. She will still go to hell."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie smiled eerily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana saw her eerie gaze and understood what Queenie meant. She wanted her to fall down the stairs like in her previous life, shattering into pieces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven also understood what Queenie meant and said unhappily, "Queenie, don't even think about hurting Diana."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie frowned, looked at Steven, sneered, and handed the dress back to Diana. "Diana, I won't fight you for it. There are plenty of luxury stores here. If you like it, it's yours."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't want anything you've touched."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie asked, "Steven has also been touched by me. Do you not want him either?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He touched your waist over your clothes. If that counts as touching, why don't you throw your clothes away? If you still feel wronged, then go ahead and end it. After all, your existence really bothers me," Diana sneered and said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was still as sharp-tongued as ever.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie hoped she would like everything arranged for her tonight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie looked deeply at Diana, then left with Mario.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She is no longer the Queenie she used to be.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wouldn't fall for Diana's trick and buy all the clothes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said regretfully, "She really has changed, or is she just lacking confidence? She actually didn't fall for it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled and said, "Can't there be another possibility? Maybe she got smarter?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No matter how smart Queenie is, she's still herself, still the same unchanged Queenie."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at the dress in her hand and instantly disliked it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She picked a white pearl dress instead, perfectly highlighting her beauty.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven liked the dress too. After paying, they left the mall together.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The evening banquet was held at Capitole Hotel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had been here a few times and was quite familiar with it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many guests had already arrived in the banquet hall.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander, Cecil, and Samuel were all there.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After greeting them, Diana and Steven went to socialize separately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander didn&rsquo;t bother Diana either. He had her favorite dishes served and went to find his partners.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the head of the Gellar family, Steven's appearance drew much attention.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many girls wanted to talk to Steven, but seeing how attentive he was to Diana and indifferent to others, they gave up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at the dishes in front of her; they were all her favorites.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Steven didn&rsquo;t like them. In such a setting, he had the privilege to have the chef prepare dishes Diana liked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, don't eat yet. I've also asked the kitchen to prepare your favorite dishes; they'll be sent over shortly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled, "Why not eat? Aren't you going to meet Leones? Go ahead. I'll stay here, have something to eat, and enjoy the view outside."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every time at gatherings, she had nothing else to do but eat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her company was managed by Nolan, so she was very relaxed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was uneasy. Tonight, he felt a vague sense of unease. With Alexander here, he felt even more unsettled. "No need. I don't need to go greet Leones. We handle everything over the phone."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At a party like this, just showing my face is enough. I want to have dinner with you. After dinner, we can meet Leones and then head back."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana agreed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They sat by the window to eat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not far away, Alexander watched the two chatting and laughing, feeling very angry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Diana, I've waited for you for over a year, not to watch you date Steven."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander tilted his head back and finished the red wine in his hand, then stared at Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was eating cake. Looking at Steven across from her, she affectionately fed him a bite of cake. Steven smiled happily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander didn't know what they were talking about. But he could see Diana smiling happily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, someone walked up behind him. Queenie said smugly, "Mr. Powell, there's something in the cake. Diana has already finished a whole piece, and Steven ate some too. Once they part ways, Diana will be taken away. Mr. Powell, you only get one chance. Make sure to seize it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie finished speaking and left with a smile before Alexander could respond.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Despicable!" Alexander cursed angrily. After drinking, he looked at Diana's radiant face, unable to control the desire in his heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, if you want to hate me, then hate me. I just like your warmth too much."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander suddenly stood up, greeted the people around him, but his eyes were fixed on Diana not far away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was very happy. A waiter came over to serve wine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The waiter stumbled, and all the wine on the tray spilled onto Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Already afraid of the cold, Diana shivered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven angrily said, "What's wrong with you? Get lost."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The waiter, frightened by Steven's words, ran away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven quickly stood up and draped his suit jacket over Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana picked up a tissue and wiped off some wine. She was very angry. "Steven, why do I feel like that person did it on purpose? This dress is ruined."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven frowned as he watched the waiter's embarrassed figure retreating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go. We're going home."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven helped her stand up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt uncomfortable all over and followed Steven out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, they were stopped by several unfamiliar men. "Mr. Gellar? Nice to meet you. I'm Zach Jenkins from the Jenkins Group."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven nodded and said, "Sorry, I have something to do tonight. I'll leave first."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1141.html">« Prev</a><a href="1143.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
