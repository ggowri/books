He said, "Queenie, will anyone be loyal to you forever? You used me and attempted to take away my company. You're not worthy of my life. Why should I cooperate with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was hoarse, filled with faint murderous intent. His mocking tone annoyed Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything was out of her control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't die, and she couldn't take Wyatt's company. It's almost the end of the year. She was exasperated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie regretted working with such an idiot as Samuel. She said coldly, "Samuel, you have only one choice now, cooperate with me. You tried to kill Cecil. Do you think he will help you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil would not forgive Samuel for what he had done. Queenie thought she could use Samuel if she drove a wedge between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she could get Wyatt's company, she could make more money from the project she had nailed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that she tried to sow discord again, Samuel sneered. "Queenie, I would have died if he hadn't helped me, and you would have taken my father's company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, you are the most vicious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel's face was contorted with anger. He glared at Queenie with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never hated someone so much before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought Queenie's heart was made of stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't hesitate to use others and ruin their lives. She didn't care about that at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What she cared about was how much money she could make and how much benefit she could get.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel thought he used to be too stupid, and he wouldn't allow her to use him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, I recorded all the calls you made to me before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie looked at his murderous eyes and laughed angrily. "Samuel, if you had recorded our calls, you would have handed it over to the police, and I would have </span><span>been taken away by them for investigation long ago. Who are you trying to scare?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie raised her eyebrow and looked down at Samuel as if he were an ant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel felt uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew how vicious Queenie was. "Queenie, what are you laughing at?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie kindly explained, "Samuel, I think you're too naive. You can take out your phone and play the recording to see what's inside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel was taken aback. He quickly took out his phone and clicked the recording. "Queenie, don't worry. I will kill Diana tonight to avenge you and myself. After I kill her, you must help me. I can't go to jail."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The recording ended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel was stunned and looked at Queenie abruptly. "No way. This is not what I recorded. Impossible. How could the content of the recording change?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glanced at Samuel. Queenie was a computer expert, and few people knew about this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Samuel possibly defeat Queenie?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Steven might not be able to rival Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie looked at Samuel sarcastically. "Samuel, who will go to jail if you turn in the recordings?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel glared at her. "How did you make it? You are terrible. No wonder you dared to tell me everything on the phone without worrying that I would record it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie shook her head, not pretending In front of Diana. "Yeah. Samuel, I never worried that you would record our conversation because I could see everything you did on your phone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were cold and gloomy. "Queenie, you will get caught one day. Get lost."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie glanced at Diana and said, "Diana, you have sabotaged my plan again. I'll get back to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana raised her eyebrow and smiled, "Ms. Marsh, I'll wait for your revenge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie gave a weird smile. "Diana, you seized the initiative when dealing with Cecil, and the same thing happened with Joseph. You met him first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can do whatever you can. Diana. If I suffer, you'll be miserable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Queenie spoke coldly, she turned to leave with George.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carlo hurried over and stopped them. "Queenie, do you give up like this? Can't we have the company?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been dreaming of it last night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carlo had long coveted the company, but his sweet dream only lasted for a few hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't accept it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie looked at the people present and smiled confidently, "Mr. Foster, why are you in such a hurry? We failed, but it doesn't mean we will fail again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carlo nodded. "Okay, okay. I'll listen to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel roared, "Get lost, you greedy beasts. You will die a miserable death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie laughed, thinking he was silly. She looked at Cecil and Diana. "Samuel, you are the ones who will die a miserable death. Let's wait and see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them left angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel was bitterly embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured in disbelief, "How can there be such a shameless creature in the world?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil looked at them and said, "Uncle Wyatt, Samuel, this is the last chance I give you. I will help you keep the company. If you hurt me again in the future, I will kill you personally."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel said, "Cecil, I'll follow you. My father has an illegitimate child. I want to split the company and work with you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I swear I will never betray you again. If I betray you, you can kill me with your own hands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel knew that Cecil had grown up. He was envious of his growth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Samuel, although I have an illegitimate child, you'll always have the company. You don't have to leave. I'll hand over the company to you and live on the dividends."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt understood a lot of things after this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was not as capable as Ivan, nor was he as resourceful as Cecil. He made no progress for so many years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil and Samuel looked at Wyatt in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he willing to hand over the company?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, are you willing to give the company to me and ignore the illegitimate son?" Samuel narrowed his eyes. Wyatt was not his usual self.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew his father was selfish and would do anything for profit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel found it hard to believe it when Wyatt said he would hand over the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt took a deep breath. He was tired. It was the young people's world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he was not old, he felt exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he decided to hand over the company to his son, Wyatt felt relaxed all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the burden off his shoulders, he felt relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt looked at his son and said earnestly, "Samuel, I'm relieved to see you've grown up a lot. My illegitimate child will not affect the company or cause a sharp drop in the stock price. I will make arrangements for the mother and son. Please spare them. He's also your brother. This is my only condition. As long as you promise me, I won't allow them to cause any trouble for you."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="941.html">« Prev</a><a href="943.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
