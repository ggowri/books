After all, they were once a couple. After Queenie left, Diana had been by his side during his most difficult time.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Evan thought to himself, &quot;Mr. Gellar is ruthless.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Once Queenie returned, he forgot about how Ms. Bishop had been good to him.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He felt it was unfair to Diana, but there was nothing he could do.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The grand banquet hosted by the Farley family took place in Capitole&#x27;s most prestigious hall at Ruby Retreat.</p><p style="text-align:left;">All attendees had arrived except for Diana, who was expected to offer her apology.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cecil, as the host, entertained the esteemed guests Queenie, Steven, and their families.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cecil gazed at the stunning Queenie with a mischievous smile and said, &quot;Queenie, you look absolutely gorgeous in that dress.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie appeared both lovely and alluring, wearing a black and seductive dress that highlighted her curves.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie smiled shyly and leaned into Steven&#x27;s arms, saying, &quot;Mr. Farley, thank you. I&#x27;m flattered.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cecil had feelings for her, appreciating her beauty and kind-hearted nature.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As a wealthy man, he had encountered various types of women.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He had seen a lot of people like Diana, who seemed inferior, shameless, and vicious.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;By the way, Queenie,&quot; Cecil continued, &quot;Diana kidnapped you, yet you still spared her. You are such a kind person.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">As soon as he finished speaking, both Queenie and Steven&#x27;s expressions changed simultaneously. Queenie had inadvertently mentioned the incident to Cecil, further fueling his resentment towards Diana.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Frowning, Steven asked, &quot;Mr. Farley, who told you about that?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie became instantly nervous. If Steven discovered that she was the one who had revealed the information, her positive image in his eyes would be shattered.</p><p style="text-align:left;">So, before Cecil could respond, Queenie quickly intervened with a smile, saying, &quot;Mr. Farley, why hasn&#x27;t Diana arrived yet? Could it be that she doesn&#x27;t dare to come?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The guests present also started talking about it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cecil furrowed his brow and sneered, &quot;It&#x27;s alright. I won&#x27;t go easy on her in private.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven frowned deeply, thinking, &quot;Even after being pushed into this situation, Diana still refuses to give in and ask for my help?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He had been awaiting Diana&#x27;s call all day, and he pressed his lips together in annoyance.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Feigning anxiety, Queenie pleaded on behalf of Diana, saying, &quot;Mr. Farley, Diana must not have done it intentionally. Please give her a chance.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie&#x27;s pleading expression appeared adorable to Cecil, who immediately beamed and replied, &quot;Queenie, you&#x27;re so kind. But this matter is not up for discussion. Once it is resolved, the Farley family will sign a contract with both the Gellar and Marsh families.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie had been anticipating that statement.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven&#x27;s eyes flickered, and he remained silent.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;But could it be that Diana really doesn&#x27;t dare to come? Everyone is waiting for her,&quot; Queenie said, glancing towards the entrance of the banquet hall.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Who said I don&#x27;t dare to come?&quot; came a cold voice.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Upon hearing the voice, everyone turned to see Diana.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana appeared in a vibrant red dress, wearing sparkling diamond jewelry. The combination of the striking red and dazzling diamonds caught everyone&#x27;s eyes.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana&#x27;s appearance exuded comfort, and her face had a captivating charm.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven was slightly taken aback; he had never seen Diana look so beautiful, radiating an alluring aura that outshone everyone present.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie felt shocked and jealous. Upon Diana&#x27;s return, Queenie noticed her true beauty.</p><p style="text-align:left;">So, she had been giving Diana all the unwanted dresses, trying to suppress her attractiveness, but now Diana was beyond her control.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cecil was also stunned because Diana now appeared like a beautiful fairy.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As the men at the banquet saw Diana, their eyes filled with admiration.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana possessed a certain enchantment, captivating attention with every move she made.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="23.html">« Prev</a><a href="25.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
