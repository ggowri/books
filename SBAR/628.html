She averted her gaze slightly and patted Queenie's hand reassuringly. "Of course, he's your father's child."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie let out a sigh of relief, grateful that he wasn't Mark's.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a dark thought crossed her mind&mdash;an idea to kill Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she decided to hold off and see if Samuel could handle that task instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had been abandoned by Steven and was still managing to live well. It felt deeply unfair to Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie whispered, "Mom, I'm pregnant."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie, already feeling down, was taken aback by the news but quickly composed herself. "Is it Steven's? That's wonderful! Just ask him to marry you, and then I'll be part of his family. How glorious that would be."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's eyes flared with anger. "It's not his. He doesn't even want to touch me. I think the car accident affected his sexual function. No matter how I try to seduce him, he doesn't respond."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was shocked. "You two are so close, but you haven't even slept together?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't believe that Steven could hold back like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie," Amelie said, "every time I see you, he takes such good care of you. What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget about it," Queenie said, clearly frustrated. "I want Steven to be the father of my child, but it feels too risky. He hasn't been as nice lately. Diana has exposed too much about me, and now Steven doesn't believe me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie's shock deepened. "Whose child is it then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Levi, the lead actor I worked with," Queenie admitted.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie's face turned to anger and disappointment. "Queenie, I've sacrificed so much for you. Is this how you repay me? I specifically told you to keep Steven. I know you find him boring, but everything he has is what you need most.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since it's not his child, you can't take that risk. You need to have an abortion. I won't let you follow in my footsteps, allowing your child to be a bastard.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you deceive the Gellar family, the consequences will be far worse."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears of anger filled Amelie's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had been torn about this decision, which was why she sought out Amelie for advice.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fearful squint, she said, "But I want to use the baby to my advantage."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie immediately shot down that idea. "Queenie, you can't take that risk. It'll only lead to more trouble. You've always been smart; don't throw your future away over a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you truly want to marry Steven, I can help you, but you cannot keep this baby. You've never even been intimate. Even if you scheme against Steven now, it's too late. Your secret could be uncovered at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember, a lot of the medical system is tied to their family. It would be easy for them to find out when you got pregnant.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll take you to the hospital tomorrow, and you'll have an abortion. It's your best option. Plus, your career is on the upswing. If anyone finds out you had a child out of wedlock, it could ruin everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was anxious and angry. She had learned some tricks over the years but never wanted Queenie to become so reckless.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="627.html">« Prev</a><a href="629.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
