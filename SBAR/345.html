I have helped many people. Joseph is just one of them. I just happened to meet him. This child was kneeling in front of the doctor..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't call him a child. He is 18, and you are 23. You are still a child in my eyes." Tom interrupted her with a smile.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You really know how to borrow my favor. Do you know how much that surgery costs abroad? With 1.2 million dollars less, it won't solve the problem. But the effect is excellent.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"His grandmother is in good health. After this treatment, as long as there is no relapse, she can live until she dies of old age," said Tom.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled gently. As long as he performed the operation, she was relieved. "Tom, our hospital has the equipment. It will only take you a little time. I will be relieved to let you perform the operation."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes! You are affirming my ability by saying that. I will do my best as the dean. But I think that boy is quite handsome. You keep saying that you want to get many men, but you still don't have one. Are you attracted to that boy?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tom, please. It is just a joke. You will laugh at me for the rest of my life, right?" Diana was speechless.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tom couldn't help laughing. "Isn't it grandfather who keeps saying he wants to find you handsome men? I saw a report a while ago that he found 10 male models for you."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes! But those 10 male models are now models of my company. But some people took pictures of me and said I was horny. Damn it. I really want to smash their disgusting heads with a hammer." Diana thought of Frank. He wouldn't be able to be so arrogant for many days.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're too kind. That's why you're always bullied by them." Tom knew her situation and felt sorry for her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he knew that Diana had let it go now. So, there was no need to feel sorry for her. She had been crazy recently.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was stunned. It was what the Marsh family would say to Queenie every time.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It turned out that only those who loved you would tolerate you infinitely.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She took a deep breath and said, "Tom, I will go back to rest first. You must pay attention to the surgery. Joseph is very filial."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I know. You should go and have some rest. Your face is as pale as a dead person. You can't even take good care of yourself."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tom suddenly said before leaving, "I received the seafood you sent. They're delicious."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana said, "I caught them myself. How can they not be delicious?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tom looked at her and was hesitant to speak. Diana knew what he wanted to say. She smiled, "Tom, please don't say it. I won't take you diving. You are a landlubber, and you will be a burden to me if you go."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tom was unhappy. He wanted to dive free as well. But after entering the water, he just wanted to run to the shore, and he didn't dare to swim at all.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I was scared. I'm on annual leave, and it's summer. Take me with you. I watched the video of you playing freely in the sea, and I was so envious that I couldn't sleep."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="344.html">« Prev</a><a href="346.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
