Could it be that he knew something about it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie clenched her fists tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled gently, "I'm sorry, Steven. I was too ignorant. I shouldn't have pushed you, but I really want to marry you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie studied his handsome features. He was tall. Even when he was seated, he exuded an effortless elegance. Had she not been aware of his background, she might have fallen deeply in love with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, she had fallen for another man, gentler and more caring than Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a teenager, Steven was brooding and bloodthirsty. He was an abandoned child living in darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Were it not for Edward and Helen, Steven would have had no claim to life itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mother was perpetually underestimated by Andrew, devoid of any standing within the Gellar family. Even the servants cast disdainful glances at Steven and his mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of this had Andrew's stamp of approval. Out there, Andrew had a woman he cherished deeply, with whom he'd been sharing his life all these years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, Andrew had other lovers, indulging in the affection of various women outside his home, all except for Steven's mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven remained silent, eating little due to his sour mood. He stood up, looking down at Queenie. Her slightly revealing clothes showed off her snowy cleavage; she was calculating. "Queenie, I said you could marry me, but I have nothing. Think it over and give me an answer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie watched his retreating back. A hint of malice flashed in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven and Diana couldn't divorce?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie didn't believe there was anything in the world that could stop Steven; he just didn't want to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She murmured, "Steven, if you won't divorce, it'll only hasten Diana's demise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, there is also Samuel's situation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, wait up!" Queenie called out, hurrying to catch up with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven stopped outside the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Devoid of any expression, he turned to face her. "Is there something else you need to say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie said, "Mr. Wyatt Farley called me. He said Diana falsely accused his son of murder. You know she's vicious; she'd frame an innocent person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard she managed to seduce Elroy and got him to sell her land in Luspus at a low price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, she's still your wife. Will you let her continue like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked deeply into her pretty face. Her skin was fair and tender. The pink dress showed off her well-proportioned legs; she looked kind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she had fooled them all before with her deceptive facade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You speak for Samuel. Do you know him?" Steven asked with a detached smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold aura emanated from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie felt a pang of discomfort. She was accustomed to Steven's warmth, and his newfound coldness left her feeling unsettled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smiled, denying, "I don't know him. Mr. Wyatt Farley called me, and I learned about this. I just didn't want Diana to frame an innocent person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana almost died. Isn't she innocent?" Steven asked with a detached smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was at a loss for words. "But she's not dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of her capable assistant imprisoned by Diana, Queenie wished Diana would go to hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If she were truly dead, you wouldn't be here throwing your snarky comments, Queenie. You used to have a kind heart, or so you seemed. If you haven't watched the video online, might as well donate those eyes of yours; they're not doing you any good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't test my patience. I can spoil you for a decade, but I can also destroy you in an instant. Diana is my wife now. I might overlook what you did to her, but I won't tolerate you slandering her in front of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I saw her win Elroy's land fair and square, and he sold it willingly. You just spread baseless accusations. Does your dirty heart make everything you see dirty?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="506.html">« Prev</a><a href="508.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
