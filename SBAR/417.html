"Mr. Gellar, the title of Capitole's richest man is undoubtedly yours."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven glanced at Diana, but she showed no reaction. In the past, every time he closed a deal, she would be happy and cook him a delicious meal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now that he had become the wealthiest, she didn't react at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He responded with a nonchalant tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was not interested in Steven being the wealthiest man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All she wanted was to live.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie, who was still on the island, also saw the news of Steven becoming the wealthiest. She was very excited as if she were already the heir to the wealthiest man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She immediately sent a message to Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Diana, Steven is now the richest man in Capitole. You no longer match him. If you know what's good for you, leave the country quickly. Don't embarrass Steven.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked at the message and laughed in anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she didn't match, could Queenie, the mistress, match instead?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She replied: [It's Steven who doesn't agree to the divorce. If you try harder to have his child, he will definitely divorce. Use the methods you used on Jace on Steven. Maybe tomorrow I can give you my place.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After that, she handed the phone to Steven. "Look, your lover can't wait to drive me away from you. You should see the message I replied to her. I think this method suits you two. As long as Queenie has your child, you two can be together without any obstacles."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven looked at the message and frowned slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana mocked, "You don't believe it? You think this message is also synthesized by me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven frowned, his deep and angry gaze fixed on her. "Do you really hope that I have a child with another woman?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I really, really hope so. I'll be free after the divorce. Shouldn't I hope for it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana laughed happily. "Mr. Gellar, have you heard a saying?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven asked, "What saying?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Staying away from a jerk is cherishing life!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven suddenly saw an unfamiliar message pop up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Diana, are you home? Be sure to message me when you get home. I will worry about you. Diana, tonight's dinner was delicious. I love it. Thank you for cooking for me.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's grip on the phone gradually tightened. She had cooked for Joseph tonight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He slightly turned his head to look at Diana, gritting his teeth, his deep eyes surging with anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He questioned loudly, "Diana, can't you live without a man?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="416.html">« Prev</a><a href="418.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
