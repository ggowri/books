Mom..." Jean shouted in the direction Diana left, but only the cold wind answered her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana returned to the car. Luna handed the thermos cup to her. "Diana, warm yourself up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana took the thermos cup. "Well! Let's go to the company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't been to the company for several days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna smiled. "Okay, Diana."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana took a sip of water, looked out the window, and felt good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's choice was expected. She did not choose to expose Mark's behavior and wanted to make him feel guilty for the rest of his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But people like Mark probably didn't feel guilty at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven saw that Diana's problem was solved smoothly, so he asked Evan to go to the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan said, "Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie and Amelie were watching the live broadcast at home and knew that Mark and Lily had divorced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it was confirmed that Amelie was Mark's mistress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie and Amelie were furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie couldn't understand why Lily didn't expose what Mark had done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Netizens had heated discussions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[How could this woman be so shameless and cheat on two men at the same time?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Moreover, the child she had with her other cheating partner, Jeff, was secretly taken home by that man to be raised, while the child she had with his original wife was secretly thrown away. It's so messed up!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[This is nothing. My neighbor has five mistresses in the same neighborhood, and they haven't been found out yet, only by me.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Are you kidding?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[So funny.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Such a mess. I can't let my daughter see this.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at those online comments, Amelie smashed her phone in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was also very angry. She collapsed and yelled, "Why did it turn out like this? How did things get so out of hand? This is not what I wanted. I'm not the mistress' daughter. I'm not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had lofty ideals. From the moment she knew she was born out of wedlock; she was fighting against time to make a good name for herself. But she still lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie didn't understand, but she still became the illegitimate daughter that everyone hated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She worked hard to grow up so that she could become a superior person and do whatever she wanted without any scruples.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, everything had changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie yelled madly, "Why Diana again? Why does she always ruin my life? Diana, you deserve to die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie put all the blame on Diana again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie's eyes were also filled with hatred. She saw Jeff coming in, picked up the remote control on the coffee table, and threw it at Jeff. "Jeff, you loser. You should kill that bitch back then. If she hadn't saved Lily, we would have won today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie bent over and yelled, "Jeff, why didn't you do it more thoroughly? That way, our daughter will not become illegitimate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff remained calm, walked over, and said sarcastically, "Why are you crying? It was a choice you made. What's wrong with being an illegitimate daughter? As long as you are capable, no one care about your identity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie looked at him angrily. "Stop talking nonsense. If you have some ability, you can protect me and my mother from being bullied."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff sat elegantly on the sofa. Looking at her ferocious face, he smiled meaningfully. "Queenie, you chose to do so. Why are you blaming me? You got Paula's company according to your plan, and I abided by your agreement. I abandoned the five children and left them powerless to fight back. What else do you want from me?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="825.html">« Prev</a><a href="827.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
