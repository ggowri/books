She was chatting with her friend, laughing cheerfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie, after sitting down, also noticed Diana's figure. The way Steven looked at Diana told her that he was starting to care about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A flash of malice flickered in Queenie's eyes. One day, she'd deal with Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She lowered her head to look at the menu. No matter how Steven treated her, as long as it appeared to others that he was on her side, that was enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Steven had become increasingly difficult for her to read, and it was a dangerous situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana and Olivia arrived at the restaurant across the street. They ordered fish and crab, both of their favorite dishes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Olivia watched the joyful Diana and asked, "Diana, have you let go?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana nodded with a smile. "He was a man I loved deeply. I haven't completely moved on, but I won't turn back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Olivia said no more. Fate was a mysterious thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Olivia handed Diana a jade pendant. "This one's small but will keep you safe. Make sure to wear it all the time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana instantly knew this meant she might be facing danger soon. She smiled gratefully. "Alright! Thank you, Olivia."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Olivia then said, "I'm leaving for abroad in a few days and won't be back for about half a month. Be careful while I'm gone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana, reluctant to part, held her hand. "Olivia, you just left the church. Why are you so busy already?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Olivia's smile was radiant. "I've lived in the church since childhood, and you're my only good friend. I have some business abroad I need to check out. I&rsquo;ll bring you something tasty when I return."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana could only nod, knowing Olivia's life at home was tough, and she had to earn money to support herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I thought you'd stay with me longer, but now you're leaving so soon," Diana said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Silly girl, there's a long road ahead. You know my situation at home, and your help has been invaluable over the years. You've funded repairs for the church and donated a million dollars every year. You've earned a lot of good karma," Olivia said warmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled, thinking maybe her kindness in her past life was why the heavens gave her a second chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Olivia, I'm donating ten million to the church this time. Help me accumulate more blessings," Diana declared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Olivia was overjoyed. "That's wonderful! This ten million is a godsend. I can renovate the church and make it more prosperous."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie instructed Luna to transfer ten million to Olivia's account.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The food arrived then, and they enjoyed their lunch before going shopping.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Diana got home, she received a call from Cecil.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil had been off the radar for a few days. The list Diana had given him last time kept him busy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Cecil," Diana said softly as she sat on the sofa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, thank you for the list. I've already caught two of them. They leaked information to Felicity. The deal lost in Woodston was her doing, and my location was exposed by someone in my company," Cecil explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana frowned. "What about the other two? Have you found out anything about them?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil's tone was cold. "These two haven't made any moves yet, but they have access to the core secrets of the Farley family. I'm worried that information has already been leaked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Recently, the Farley family was negotiating an overseas project. It was supposed to be signed today, but when my dad arrived, the other side seemed hesitant," Cecil added.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana suddenly stood up. "Cecil, get your dad back immediately. He's in danger. If I'm not wrong, your family's lowest offer has been leaked. There's no way they'll sign with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But..."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="239.html">« Prev</a><a href="241.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
