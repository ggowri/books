A harmonious atmosphere filled the room, their voices rising and falling as they exchanged ideas and listened intently to each other&#x27;s opinions.</p><p>Alexander was often caught off guard by Diana&#x27;s fresh perspectives. The more he understood her, the more energized he became. It was like every new thought she shared turned the world around him into a glittering prize.</p><p>They were lost in their conversation, hours slipping by unnoticed. Two hours later, everything had been discussed and settled.</p><p>Diana&#x27;s back ached horribly. The intensity of the work had taken a toll on her—she was exhausted.</p><p>She knew it—office life just wasn&#x27;t for her. She was meant to lie down, not sit at a desk all day.</p><p>She couldn&#x27;t stand it for much longer. Two hours was already too much.</p><p>That bastard Steven—she hadn&#x27;t agreed to his partnership, but somehow he&#x27;d found a way to rope her in any way.</p><p>&quot;Alexander, it&#x27;s getting late. Let&#x27;s call it a night. My back is killing me. I just can&#x27;t sit at a desk all day,&quot; she said, standing up, her voice tinged with frustration. She twisted her waist, trying to ease the pain, and shifted her feet, which were sore too.</p><p>Alexander&#x27;s eyes softened with a gentle smile. He knew she&#x27;d been sitting too long. &quot;Alright. I&#x27;ve got a little surprise for you—gifts and some late-night snacks. I&#x27;ll have the butler bring them to the car.&quot;</p><p>Diana smiled, feeling a rush of warmth. Looking at him, with his soft expression and warm eyes, she couldn&#x27;t help but think, &quot;This is the future mogul. So kind, so tender.&quot; It wasn&#x27;t what she expected at all.</p><p>&quot;Thanks, Alexander. You didn&#x27;t have to, but I appreciate it. I&#x27;ve got something for you too—some cookies I baked myself. You can snack on them while you work. They&#x27;re really good.&quot;</p><p>Alexander&#x27;s eyes lit up with tenderness as he smiled, nodding. &quot;Diana, you&#x27;re an amazing baker. Late nights at the office just got a whole lot better.&quot;</p><p>He stood, his tone warm and reassuring. &quot;Let me walk you out.&quot;</p><p>Diana didn&#x27;t bother with politeness. She settled into the wheelchair beside her, the injury still fresh—three months of recovery ahead. She knew that if she stayed in the chair, it would help speed up her healing.</p><p>Alexander&#x27;s eyes flickered to her bandaged foot, his thoughts briefly turning to Steven and Queenie, who were now openly together. Unable to hold back, he finally asked, &quot;Diana... did you and Steven get the divorce papers?&quot;</p><p>Diana remembered telling him about it before. She smiled softly, her tone light, &quot;It&#x27;s all taken care of.&quot;</p><p>Alexander&#x27;s gaze softened as he looked at her. His eyes lingered on her—her hair, straight and glossy, cascading like silk, the delicate scent of it lingering in the air. He inhaled deeply, a quiet satisfaction spreading through him. Diana had finally divorced him.</p><p>The weight he&#x27;d been carrying for so long, holding back his feelings for her, had lifted. He didn&#x27;t have to fight it anymore.</p><p>For months, he&#x27;d kept his distance, worried about the rumors it might stir, about how it might affect her reputation.</p><p>But now, with Steven and Queenie flaunting their relationship, he didn&#x27;t have to hide. He could see her openly and be with her whenever he wanted.</p><p>The chill of the evening air hit them as Alexander wrapped a scarf around her neck, making sure she was warm before gently pushing her out the door.</p><p>The car was waiting at the curb, the butler already loading the gifts into the back.</p><p>Luna, standing nearby, opened the door and gave them a small, knowing smile as she watched Alexander&#x27;s soft, affectionate expression.</p><p>Together, Alexander and Diana made a perfect pair.</p><p>His looks were undeniable—handsome in his own right, though perhaps not as strikingly cold and intimidating as Steven&#x27;s. There was something about him, though, something warmer, gentler, that balanced out the sharpness of Steven&#x27;s presence.</p><p>When they reached the car, Diana tried to stand on her own, determined to get in by herself.</p><p>But the moment she stood up, Alexander scooped her off the ground effortlessly, lifting her into his arms.</p><p>&quot;Alexander!&quot; Diana gasped in surprise.</p><p>His sudden action startled her.</p><p>He realized he&#x27;d scared her and softened his tone. &quot;Diana, the ground&#x27;s too slippery. I don&#x27;t want you to fall again, and I don&#x27;t want your leg getting worse and slowing down your recovery.</p><p>&quot;Your leg will heal in three months, as long as nothing goes wrong.&quot;</p><p>His explanation made sense, and her tense body instantly relaxed a little. Alexander was the matchmaker set up by Leopold, and their closeness made her think more than she should.</p><p>He gently lowered her into the backseat of the car, carefully fastening her seatbelt with a tenderness that caught her off guard.</p><p>Diana&#x27;s face flushed pink. She&#x27;d spent a long time with Steven, but their physical closeness was minimal. Being this close to a man, especially one as attractive as Alexander, still made her feel uneasy.</p><p>She looked up at him with a playful grin. &quot;Thanks, Alexander! You can go home and rest now. You&#x27;ve worked hard today, sitting with me for three hours going through documents.&quot;</p><p>Alexander shook his head, smiling softly as he gazed at her mischievous expression. If it weren&#x27;t for everything with Steven and Queenie, Diana would be a bright, lively girl full of energy.</p><p>Leopold had once told him he&#x27;d known Diana when she was younger—she&#x27;d been exceptional. Mischievous, sharp, a quick learner who could master anything.</p><p>Not many people had caught Leopold&#x27;s eye, but Diana was one of the rare ones.</p><p>Alexander smiled gently, &quot;Alright. Just message me when you get home, okay?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Got it,&quot; Diana replied with a nod.</p><p>Reluctantly, he closed the door, lingering for a moment before stepping back.</p><p>After exchanging a quick goodbye with Luna, Alexander drove off, heading home.</p><p>Alexander stood in the cold wind, watching as Diana&#x27;s car disappeared into the distance. A soft, tender smile played on his lips.</p><p>Meanwhile, not far off, Steven sat in his car, watching. The sight of Alexander&#x27;s gentle expression, paired with the thought that Diana had been inside that car for hours, sent a wave of fury through him.</p><p>That bastard was still thinking about Diana. He glared at Alexander&#x27;s hands, wishing he could sever them.</p><p>Evan had just woken up and caught the scene as well.</p><p>His eyes flickered to Steven in the rearview mirror. Beneath his dark brows, his deep, cold gaze gleamed with a murderous intent. It was as if his stare alone could shatter Alexander into a thousand pieces.</p><p>If Steven didn&#x27;t make a move soon, Diana might just slip away from him.</p><p>He let out a sharp hiss, shuddering slightly as the cold air seemed to seep into the car.</p><p>&quot;Mr. Gellar, are we heading back? Or...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, we&#x27;re going back,&quot; Steven snapped, his voice icy.</p><p>He couldn&#x27;t stand being in this car any longer. If he stayed any longer, he&#x27;d lose it.</p><p>At least back at the office, he could keep tabs on Diana. He couldn&#x27;t trust her alone for a second.</p><p>Evan exhaled in relief, finally able to get back to the apartment.</p><p>Meanwhile, Diana was exhausted. She closed her eyes and drifted off, needing a moment to rest.</p><p>Luna glanced at her through the rearview mirror and smiled softly, &quot;Diana, Alexander&#x27;s gentle with you.&quot;</p><p>Diana&#x27;s eyes snapped open, her long lashes fluttering in surprise.</p><p>&quot;Luna, you&#x27;re starting to tease me now? Alexander&#x27;s just worried I&#x27;ll slip. What are you thinking?&quot;</p><p>Before Luna could respond, a blinding set of headlights suddenly flared into view. Luna&#x27;s pupils dilated in alarm, and with a sharp yank on the wheel, she swerved to avoid the oncoming car.</p><p>This was a bridge she&#x27;d driven over countless times, but the shock of the moment made her instincts take over.</p><p>She jerked the wheel again, pulling it back just as quickly.</p><p>A deafening crash rang out behind them.</p><p>&quot;Boom.&quot;</p><p>The sound of something heavy plunging into the river echoed in the night.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="972.html">« Prev</a><a href="974.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
