He was always like this. Whenever something happened, he always looked at her indifferently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was never willing to believe her once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sneered; her smile was very desolate, showing a kind of miserable beauty in the snow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It deeply hurt Steven's eyes. He had never felt such heartache before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he had this feeling toward Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, I can say it as many times as you want. When you helped Queenie to bully me and abandoned me again and again, didn't you ever think that I would hate you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he felt anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven already knew the truth of the matter, so he was speechless and unable to refute it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was bullied by Samuel because Steven kicked her out of the car on the highway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As her husband, it seemed like he had given her nothing but hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was the only woman in the world who truly loved him, but she was heartbroken by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disappointment in her eyes made Steven feel panicky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at him without saying anything and continued, "Steven, you don't want to divorce. I know it's because of the inheritance rights. I loved you, so I didn't force you to divorce. The two years will be up soon. When the time comes, I will go to court to file for divorce."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By that time, he had already taken sole control of the power and had no scruples anymore, so he would let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her opinion, Steven always put Queenie and his interests first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had always known that he did not love her. He treated her like this now because he felt guilty after knowing some of the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But, at this moment, Steven really made her irritated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were filled with panic as he looked at Diana's ruthless gaze. She didn't care about what had happened before, but this time on the highway, Diana was completely disappointed in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that Diana knew everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was upset, and his voice was as hoarse as the harsh winter wind. "Okay! When the two years are up, I will divorce you. But it's not possible now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was still one year left, and this year would be the turning point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he left in silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana took a deep breath, suppressed all the bitterness in her heart, and then drove in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She drove the car to the garage, parked it, and went straight in through the side door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heating was on in the room, and she was enveloped in warmth as soon as she entered the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's cold and painful heart was instantly warmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps this was her familiar home, which could make her feel warm and at ease and not so irritable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at the time. In a few days, it would be Althea's due date, so she wanted to go and accompany Althea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale was not a good man, but Althea was her good friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sent a message to Nolan, saying that she had to go out for a few days and asked him to look after the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the way, she asked him to design the development of the resort in Luspus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Diana came back from the island, the land that Queenie bought from Cecil would also be developed. By then, Queenie and the person behind her would be angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She deployed it so carefully, but there were still loopholes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People's thoughts were ever-changing. Just because Diana knew about things in her previous life, she would not follow the plot. She would also think of many countermeasures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But today, Queenie finally drove herself crazy with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana watched it live. Therefore, she was in a very good mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this time, Nolan sent to Diana: [Diana, I got it. You finally figured it out and stopped wasting your youth for Steven.]</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="535.html">« Prev</a><a href="537.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
