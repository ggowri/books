How can you be so vicious? I've let go of you. Why can't you let go of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven smiled carelessly and said, "Diana, you were determined to get a divorce at that time, so I had no choice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wasn't that what you wanted? Do you remember how many divorce agreements you gave me before?" Diana was furious with his shamelessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, she was too ignorant. She was so angry that her blood pressure soared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven raised an eyebrow and said, "Diana, you're so cute. We are meant to be, and I won't let you go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at him speechlessly, thinking, "Those words are somehow a bit seductive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't know if she was overthinking it. "It seems that your love for Queenie is not as deep as I thought!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now I finally understand, you don't love anyone, you only love yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, if you ever dare to come here again, I'll call Queenie. Given her possessiveness towards you, she..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, don't try to challenge my bottom line because you can't handle the consequences. I don't make choices. I make decisions, and my decision is never to divorce you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The towering Steven stood up, walked to her, and looked down at her from above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana leaned nervously against the chair back, his pressure making her tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at her nervous expression and found it cute. He suppressed the lust in his heart and smiled faintly, "Diana, be good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly lowered his head and kissed her forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana instantly felt as if she had been stung by a fly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pushed Steven away forcefully, glaring at him, "Get away! Don't touch me! Since you've slept with Queenie, don't come and gross me out. Steven, you're really despicable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was so angry that she furiously wiped her forehead. "I need to get alcohol to disinfect." Diana's words were highly insulting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was instantly furious, roughly grabbing Diana's hand, looking at her with deep anger, and growling, "Diana, do you disdain me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! I always have. Only you think yourself noble. Do you think everyone is like you and Queenie, bedding down with anyone who comes along?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned, wondering, "What does she mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without much thought, he held Diana in his arms and kissed her incessantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana gave up struggling for a moment, feeling utterly hopeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven, caught in the kiss, was about to get more when Diana bit him hard on the lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ouch..." Steven stepped back in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He licked the bleeding spot on his tongue, looking devilishly charming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The touch of red on his lips had a strange beauty to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at her with eyes full of unrestrained wildness as if the pain was not a torment for him but a unique enjoyment, exuding a fatal allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stared at him blankly. His presence made her heart race as if a little deer was rampaging in her chest, each thump leaving her breathless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her gaze was firmly locked on Steven in front of her, unable to shift an inch.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="601.html">« Prev</a><a href="603.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
