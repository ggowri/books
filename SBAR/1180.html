You, this little bastard brought in from the outside, naturally love it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A mocking voice came from behind. Diana spun around to see a woman in an elaborate black gown, pale skin, delicate features, red lips curved in a sneering smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's temper flared. The three Bishop brothers' gazes turned ice-cold as they stared at her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana: "Who the hell are you calling a bastard?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yuki Bishop: "I'm calling you a bastard."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She paused, stunned. Diana grinned wickedly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yuki Bishop: "You... you..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What about me? There's a river right there&mdash;such a big damn river&mdash;and it still couldn't wash the shit out of your mouth. If you can't speak properly, keep it shut. Every word makes me sick."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana never held back when tearing someone down. Yuki Bishop's face flushed with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Copper Bishop chuckled. His precious girl wasn't someone just anyone could mess with. If it weren't for that pathetic bit of family loyalty to Paula, she wouldn't have been bullied like this for three years.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Copper Bishop's eyes turned cold: "Yuki Bishop, what are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yuki Bishop lifted her chin arrogantly: "Copper, I came to see what your bastard daughter looks like, and to tell you&mdash;there can only be one little princess in the Bishop family, and that's me. So what if you brought your daughter back? This castle will still be mine in the end."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her smile was vicious, like she'd already won.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana suddenly understood why Grandpa had brought her back so quickly&mdash;someone was trying to bully Dad.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Says who? This is my home, mine. I'm my father's biological daughter. You want to steal the castle? Let's see if you've got what it takes. Just running your mouth will only get you slapped down hard."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone's born with a purpose, but you look pretty damn useless!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yuki Bishop's anger flared: "Diana, if Copper hadn't hidden you so well, you think you'd still be alive?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yuki Bishop turned to Leopold: "Grandpa, you're biased beyond belief. To secretly raise Copper's child, you've been telling everyone all four kids were adopted. I know these three men are adopted, but you treat outsiders better than me. You gave all your money to these three bastards and your granddaughter, while I only got shares in the Baili family business."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grandpa, how can you face my father?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yuki Bishop's voice was sharp and accusatory. If this old man hadn't deceived them, Diana would be dead already&mdash;how could she possibly be alive now? She'd only discovered Copper had a biological daughter in the past couple days. Before she could make her move, the woman had come back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold's gaze turned cold as he walked to a nearby sofa and sat down. It was the family head's seat, luxurious and expensive. Only after settling in did he speak slowly:</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Su Baiyi, you're from my Tobias branch&mdash;you split off from the family long ago. But you're ambitious, wanting to get the Bishop Manor and the head position of the entire Bishop family."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've known your plans all along. This family's power runs deep and complex. For twenty years, my son and I have worked together, using my three grandsons to strip your father of his power. Your father wants to fight back today? Let's see if he has what it takes. Your father's overseas assets are all controlled by my three grandsons, his domestic market is controlled by my granddaughter's Azure Group, and all his properties here at the Baili castle are controlled by my son. You're surrounded on all sides, and you still dare talk big?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My son and I have been plotting for twenty years, setting up this elaborate game for you people. I even kept my own granddaughter away from home, all to send you heartless bastards straight to hell."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I knew you'd make your move today, so I came back early this morning. With me here, you're destined to fail."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Uncle, that's not right. Winners take all, losers fall&mdash;and I haven't lost yet, have I?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man and woman in expensive clothes walked in, followed by a group of bodyguards. These were Yuki Bishop's parents. Darnell Bishop held a cigarette between his fingers, squinting as he took a couple of satisfying drags.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold snapped, "Put out that damn cigarette! My baby's pregnant and can't stand your secondhand smoke."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darnell Bishop froze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at Diana, who did resemble Tobias quite a bit. "This girl's pregnant? An outsider's kid gets to be the heir?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold slammed his hand on the sofa armrest. "Outsider? You're the outsider here! You're adopted, remember? Sure, adopted sons have inheritance rights, but if you dare mess with me, don't blame me for what happens next. Your father's getting old, hiding at home instead of coming himself, sending you to fight his battles. But can you really compete with my Diana?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My baby graduated college at sixteen, then got her master's degree. She's got multiple degrees and incredible medical skills. Your daughter hasn't even finished college yet, has she? My baby's about to be a mother, and your daughter doesn't even have a boyfriend."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My baby runs multiple companies. What can your daughter do besides spend money? The difference is so obvious&mdash;how dare you come here and provoke us?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ahhhhh&mdash;" Darnell Bishop let out a furious roar, completely outmatched.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana jumped. Steven immediately pulled her close, helping her sit on the sofa. Everyone else froze, watching Yuki Bishop's meltdown.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias asked, "Is she still half asleep or something?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yuki Bishop suddenly turned to Tobias, instantly mesmerized by his handsome features. She gasped, "You're so gorgeous! Do you have a girlfriend?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias immediately regretted opening his mouth. He ducked behind Julius, refusing to answer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Copper Bishop felt uncomfortable watching his daughter's behavior&mdash;she was making a fool of herself. He called his lawyer over. "Darnell Bishop, my lawyer will handle your asset liquidation. You went bankrupt last night."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bankrupt? Yeah, I know I'm bankrupt. I've been scheming against you for twenty years, but I never expected you to outplay me this badly. I'm here today to take you down with me. Give up the family head position and get out with your bastard daughter. I might let you live."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A gun suddenly appeared in his hand, barrel pointed straight at Diana's forehead. Once Copper Bishop's daughter returned, she became the most precious thing in this house.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven immediately shielded Diana, his eyes dark as he stared down Darnell Bishop. But Diana pushed Steven aside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, don't." Steven held her tight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana gave him a look that said 'stay calm.' She looked at Darnell Bishop with confusion. "Uncle, your grip on that gun is all wrong."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darnell Bishop paused, surprised. "I've got a gun pointed at your head, and you're not scared?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1179.html">« Prev</a><a href="1181.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
