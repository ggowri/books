As soon as they entered, they smelled a strong aroma of grilled meat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana chuckled, "After we finish dinner and go out, we'll still carry the scent of grilled meat on us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil actually enjoyed grilled meat quite a bit. After every car race, he would go to have grilled meat and beer with his good friends. It was their hobby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I've eaten here before. It's pretty good. I've booked a private room, and the smell won't be as strong in there."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With his hands in his trouser pockets, Cecil's casual, roguish charm attracted the attention of the girls around them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Such a handsome man! He looks like a big star from a TV show," one girl screamed excitedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil winked at her, then put his arm around Diana's shoulder, signaling to the girls that he already had a girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The girl looked dejected, waved her hand, and sat back down to continue eating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana always found the outside world quite interesting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">These girls were so lovely. When they encountered someone they liked, they could shout it out loud, with kindness in their eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She really should get out more often.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They settled in a private room on the second floor. Cecil poured water for Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana picked up the glass and took a graceful sip of water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She said, "Cecil, if Queenie is indeed behind your situation, she will send people to retaliate against me tonight. If we encounter danger later, you figure out a way to escape. Don't worry about me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil's movements halted. He looked at her with deep eyes, "Why? Do you think I'm that kind of person?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana replied leisurely, "I'm afraid you'll hold me back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil's hand trembled. Alright, he overthought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It turned out he wasn't worthy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing his stiff expression, Diana couldn't help but chuckle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But I have a second plan..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana shared her plan with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, Cecil's hand trembled even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He thought, "Are there really women that malicious in this world?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil had, in fact, underestimated Queenie's malice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They enjoyed their grilled meat without any incidents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, when they came out, a sudden fragrance filled the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Before Diana could warn Cecil, he collapsed weakly on the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana asked, "Cecil, how do you feel?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil looked at her weakly. She struggled a bit but still couldn't get up. "Diana, my legs are weak."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that moment, four men wearing silicone masks emerged from the opposite private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">One of the men approached Cecil and kicked him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You little brat, you escaped before, but you won't get away tonight." The man laughed arrogantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil asked angrily, "Did Queenie send you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The man shook his head. "I don't know her. Someone paid a lot of money for me to kill both of you. Now, come with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil looked at their masks and was slightly shocked. They were from the Chaos League.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He looked at Diana. "Diana, they are from the Chaos League. You have to run."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="180.html">« Prev</a><a href="182.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
