He admired Steven, one of the rising stars of the past two years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven didn't offer an explanation; he simply gave a faint smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He glanced into the distance, noticing that Diana and Luna were gone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The place was crowded with guests. Jace took the stage, speaking about the Foliot family's history and accomplishments over the years, before finally mentioning the evening's main event&mdash;his birthday celebration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After the formalities, Jace invited Queenie onto the stage, introducing her to everyone present.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Ladies and gentlemen, this is Ms. Marsh. I hope all my business partners will show her respect in the future. She saved my grandson's life and is a benefactor to my family. From now on, she will be treated as dearly as my granddaughter."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jeff was grinning ear to ear; this was his daughter's moment in the spotlight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven narrowed his eyes slightly. This scene felt very familiar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula recalled what had happened to Rita and understood why Jace valued Queenie so much tonight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie had skills, but her methods were despicable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone smiled and congratulated Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, Diana and Cecil sat together in a distant corner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil's cold gaze was fixed on Queenie, who was shining on stage. He finally understood her tactics.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Farley family had almost fallen into Queenie's hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana, nibbling on a pastry, asked with a grin, "Cecil, does this familiar scenario seem a bit too familiar?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil sneered. "So, she pretended to be you to save Grandma, all to pull off this scheme. No wonder she mentioned a collaboration the very next day. I have to admit, her acting skills are good. Unlike you, who's so blunt and distant. She's gentle."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"That's why men go crazy for her," Diana said, her eyes crinkling with amusement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil didn't deny it. Queenie had indeed made him feel protective back then. Curious, he asked, "What will happen to the Foliot family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana's gaze flickered. "They'll become Queenie's leverage. Once they're no longer useful, they'll be devoured."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was inevitable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jace wasn't exactly a good person either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That's why Diana hadn't interfered with Queenie's scheme.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She got involved with the Farley family because Rita trusted her and was a good, honorable person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Puzzled, Cecil asked, "Diana, if you knew this was going to happen, why didn't you stop it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana smiled calmly. "Why stop it? Jace is nothing like your grandmother. He's always been crooked, while Madam Farley is upright and fair, always putting family and the company first, unlike the one on stage..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana didn't finish her sentence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil laughed cheerfully. "So, you admit that I have good character, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana finished her last bite of cake and replied with a smile, "Your character is indeed good. That's a fact. Your grandmother is someone I respect greatly, so how bad could her grandson be?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her tone was sincere, and the words came from the heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil gazed deeply at her, saying nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Noticing a sneaky figure behind her, Diana stood up with a mischievous smile. "Mr. Farley, get ready for a good show."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="196.html">« Prev</a><a href="198.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
