When he opened it, he found a nine-photo Instagram post she'd made.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan was thrilled. "Mr. Gellar, I found her. Ms. Bishop is on the South Island. She arrived last night and just posted about diving for lobsters."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven stood up and snatched the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven saw Diana smiling happily with the diving instructor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He suddenly remembered what Diana had once said, "Steven, I love the ocean. When your leg heals, will you dive with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the time, he had merely nodded, making no promises.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had hoped he would join her, but now she had gone alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had done so much for him, but he had never done anything for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She even refused to take his money during the divorce, finding it "dirty."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He appreciated her efforts but overlooked her presence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had stood by him for two years, through his toughest battles, yet he still failed to see her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In his mind, she only wanted the position of Mrs. Gellar. Even with Queenie's return, he believed it wouldn't affect her status.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">An uncontrollable, stinging pain spread through Steven's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't know when it began, but seeing her smile at another man made his heart ache.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven asked him, "She hasn't blocked this number?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan explained, "Mr. Gellar, this is a backup number I once gave Ms. Bishop. I added her on WhatsApp, and she must have forgotten to block it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven said, "I'll use this phone. Buy yourself a new one and report it as an expense."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan was shocked. "Mr. Gellar, Ms. Bishop has already let you and Ms. Marsh be together. I think it's best if you finalize the divorce. Now that you've invested in Queenie's films, a love triangle scandal could hurt the company."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan gathered his courage to advise him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sigh! Diana lost in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He still chose Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Poor Diana, who gave everything to Steven, only to pave the way for Queenie in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's cold eyes swept over him. "How much did Diana pay you to convince me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan shook his head. "Ms. Bishop didn't pay me, nor did she ask me to persuade you. I just think this isn't good for the company." He dreaded spending another night in the PR office if the video leaked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His mother was already pushing him to go on blind dates. Wouldn't it be nicer to spend evenings with a girlfriend instead?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven changed the subject. "Did you find out who that man was?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan shook his head. "Mr. Gellar, I checked all the hotels. There's no record, just that one time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Got to admit, Queenie hid it well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sigh! Mr. Gellar, I really think you made a mistake this time. I've been by your side for years, and I truly believe no one will ever love you like Ms. Bishop did."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan genuinely felt sorry for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie and Diana were different people; Diana was pure-hearted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was skilled at manipulating emotions. Her relationship with Steven had always been hot and cold, keeping him guessing. She was a master of mind games.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan's words pushed Steven's already aching heart into the abyss.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="254.html">« Prev</a><a href="256.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
