I can't let anything happen to me. I must wait for him to return. Once he turns things around, I'll become the chairman."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff finally gave in. "Fine! I'll be your stepping stone. But I want one million dollars this month. Don't forget, Queenie! I've got proof that you've been using me all along!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff smirked smugly. "Queenie, I'm sure you don't want this to turn ugly between us. All I want is money. I couldn't care less about anything else you're up to."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie sneered, "I'll have someone transfer you a million dollars right away. You'll get the same amount every year, as long as you keep playing your role as my father and don't cause any trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff chuckled, "Well, well! One million dollars a year is enough for my retirement. My daughter sure knows how to take care of her old man."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie hung up the phone without a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold glint flickered in her eyes. Finally, she was getting closer to her goal.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what about the baby?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes darkened with malice. "Damn you, Levi. I'll make you pay dearly for this. I need to find a way to get rid of this pregnancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This baby can't be born. No one can ever know about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie gleefully picked up her phone, pleased to see everyone trashing Diana online.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her joy was short-lived as Mario came rushing in, panic written all over his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie frowned, "What's wrong, Mario?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario hesitated, and before he could speak, the police walked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie froze at the sight of them. "You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Queenie Marsh, we've received a report that you're involved in deliberately defaming Ms. Diana Bishop. We need you to come with us to the station for questioning."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Queenie was stunned. She had been about to call Diana just to rub it in, but Diana had beaten her to the punch by calling the cops.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie shook her head defensively. "I... I didn't... I didn't frame her. She's the one who ruined my reputation."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lead officer, a handsome man with refined features, showed her the warrant. "Miss, during your press conference just now, you repeatedly accused Diana of defamation and slander. She has filed a police report, and we need you to come with us for an investigation.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If she really did defame you and damage your reputation, you should have pursued legal channels to protect yourself, not resort to these tactics."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was livid. "Have you all lost your minds? Who cares how I handle this? Do you know who I am? I'm Steven's fiancee! You dare take me to the police station?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, but regardless of who you are, we have to follow proper procedure," the officer said sternly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll need to come with us for questioning."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie noticed how the officer remained unmoved, utterly unfazed by Steven's presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was starting to panic. She had anticipated various scenarios and prepared different strategies for a long-term PR battle with Diana, but she never expected Diana to counter-attack so directly and brutally.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, she had no evidence to back up her claims.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, this is all a misunderstanding. I'll call Diana right now."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="730.html">« Prev</a><a href="732.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
