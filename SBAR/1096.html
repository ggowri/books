"Queenie, I got caught stealing the company</span><span>'</span><span>s confidential files. I ran away just to see how you</span><span>'</span><span>d treat me. I just wanted to know if what Eric said was true&mdash;that if I gave you the files, you</span><span>'</span><span>d send me to my death. Turns out, it is."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan</span><span>'</span><span>s eyes filled with tears, ultimately defeated by reality.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had thought Eric was biased against Queenie just because she was their father</span><span>'</span><span>s illegitimate daughter. Now he realized the biased one was him&mdash;Queenie was truly vicious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sneered at Queenie, "Queenie, you</span><span>'</span><span>ll never take over the Barnes Group. It</span><span>'</span><span>s meant to be Diana</span><span>'</span><span>s compensation. No one will ever truly love you, and no one will ever genuinely help you. You</span><span>'</span><span>re pathetic."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And one more thing, you</span><span>'</span><span>ll never beat Diana. She</span><span>'</span><span>s smarter than you, more capable than you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I believe she won</span><span>'</span><span>t lose. The one who</span><span>'</span><span>ll lose is definitely you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan burst into laughter, his whole body trembling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The biggest regret of his life was not trusting his own family and believing in Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie looked at Dylan like he was a madman.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She yelled, "Dylan, are you crazy? Did you just say I'm not as good as Diana?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan looked at her anger and laughed with delight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 5.15pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had always doted on Queenie.</span><span> </span><span>He thought he was the exception&mdash;that to her, he might be something irreplaceable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 5.15pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in Queenie</span><span>'</span><span>s eyes?</span><span> </span><span>He was just another disposable fool.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He remembered a phrase he once read, "Never gamble on human nature!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Queenie angry made Dylan genuinely happy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But his heart ached. Turns out, even selfish people can feel pain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan nodded with tears in his eyes, a bitter smile on his face. "Queenie, you'll never beat Diana. The five of us are real siblings. You? A bastard child? What makes you think you can compare to her?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What just happened had already infuriated Queenie. Dylan's words now cut her like a knife.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie hated nothing more than being called a bastard child.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everything she had planned before was to escape the stigma of being a bastard child.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in the end, Paula's outburst exposed Queenie's identity as a bastard child.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie stared at Dylan through her tears, her fists clenched tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She never expected Dylan to say something like that. Furious, she snapped, "Dylan, you say I'm the little sister you've spoiled since we were kids, but then you call me cruel. How are you any better than me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Pathetic!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan didn</span><span>'</span><span>t get angry. In fact, he thought Queenie was absolutely right.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Queenie, you're absolutely right. I am pathetic. Thank you for reminding me. I'll remember this lesson you taught me&mdash;it woke me up completely."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You've shown me the true horror of human nature, made me understand the terror of an illegitimate child. Illegitimate children only ever love gain; no amount of love will ever satisfy them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, from this moment on, you're no longer my sister."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan laughed calmly, as if he had finally let it all go.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie froze for a moment. She had always thought Dylan was just an idiot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now he regretted it, even cursing her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie tilted her head, mocking him, "Dylan, you finally learned how to act like a man."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That sentence nearly pushed Dylan to the brink.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gave a bitter laugh. "Yeah. Guess I had to hit rock bottom to really know myself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I betrayed my mom for someone like you, trashed my sister in front of the media.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But what did I get in return? You wanted to kill me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan let out a careless laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter what came next, he was ready to face it head-on.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan thought, "I'm still young. I</span><span>'</span><span>m not afraid of prison. Once I</span><span>'</span><span>m out, there</span><span>'</span><span>s still time to do whatever I want. Queenie is just trash I happened to come across in my life."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gave a bitter smile. "Yeah, this time I finally didn</span><span>'</span><span>t hurt my mom and sister again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, I may not have proof that you made me steal the company</span><span>'</span><span>s secrets, but I believe you</span><span>'</span><span>ll face harsh punishment someday."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan walked away with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario quickly said, "Queenie, we can</span><span>'</span><span>t let him leave."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie wanted to stop him, but then she heard Dylan say, "Police, this is Dylan. I</span><span>'</span><span>m turning myself in. I stole my mom</span><span>'</span><span>s company trade secrets."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie watched Dylan's back as he walked into the elevator, fuming with anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan</span><span>'</span><span>s sudden change of heart and turning himself in left her feeling both furious and incredulous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She believed Eric would turn himself in.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Dylan, just as selfish and self-serving as Jeff, actually turned himself in.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Queenie quickly calmed down. She only cared about the outcome.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All she ever wanted was a perfect outcome.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario looked worried. He shut the door, took Queenie</span><span>'</span><span>s hand, and studied the pain on her face. From now on, he would be her greatest support.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew George wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t as capable as he was.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could see Queenie</span><span>'</span><span>s disappointment in George growing. He didn</span><span>'</span><span>t even have to say a word&mdash;Queenie was already starting to get fed up with him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the real Steven came back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario thought, "Steven is so despicable. All these years, he</span><span>'</span><span>s been lurking around Queenie, and even I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t notice anything off."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie might feel differently about Steven," he thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, what</span><span>'</span><span>s Dylan gonna do? I</span><span>'</span><span>m worried he might say something stupid at the station," Mario said, a hint of unease in his voice. He</span><span>'</span><span>d come this far just to be Queenie</span><span>'</span><span>s man, to have her wealth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was confident in her assumptions. She flashed Mario a smile and said, "Don</span><span>'</span><span>t worry. Even if he says something he shouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t, it won</span><span>'</span><span>t matter. Too bad I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t get my hands on Paula</span><span>'</span><span>s company secrets."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie looked at Mario with sadness in her eyes. It was rare for her to show this vulnerable side in front of him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Mario, everyone says I</span><span>'</span><span>m ruthless, ambitious. But all I ever wanted was to be myself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I just wanted to see a bigger world. Mario, what did I do wrong?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1095.html">« Prev</a><a href="1097.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
