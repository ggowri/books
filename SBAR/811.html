Sometimes, a good cry was the best way to heal.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jean had been well-educated, yet she showed no sign of mourning her mother&#x27;s departure.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her resentment towards being controlled by Lily had created a cold distance between them.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana understood how fragile that bond was.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She recognized that Lily had devoted her life to raising her children, only to see it undermined by Amelie&#x27;s influence.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The more Lily tried to be strict, the more Jean sought refuge in Amelie&#x27;s gentleness.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After a few minutes, Lily&#x27;s sobs quieted, but her throat felt tight, as if a weight was pressing down. She sat silently, allowing the pain to wash over her, her mind replaying the scene from the mall.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As Diana drove them back to the hospital, the heavy burden on Lily&#x27;s heart began to ease.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Once they reached the ward, she turned to Diana and offered a grateful smile. &quot;Diana, thank you for bringing me here. Now I understand my daughter&#x27;s true feelings. I have no regrets about how I raised her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;From now on, I will focus on loving myself.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana smiled in return. &quot;Mrs. Foliot, when you learn to love yourself, you&#x27;ve already conquered the world.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Lily regarded her with a tender gaze, knowing they had both faced similar struggles.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Diana, I see that your mother regrets her actions. Could you consider forgiving her?&quot; She recalled her two encounters with Paula, each filled with remorse.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana chuckled softly. &quot;Mrs. Foliot, I&#x27;ve been hurt just like you. Can you forgive your daughter?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Lily shook her head firmly. &quot;I will never forgive her. She&#x27;s an adult now and made her own choices. Let her deal with the consequences.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">At that moment, Lily realized that Diana would never forgive Paula.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana smiled but remained silent, encouraging her to rest and prepare for what lay ahead.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Lily then called her parents, assuring them of her safety, and instructed her father&#x27;s lawyer to start the divorce process.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She had collected some evidence and was ready to act once Amelie made her move.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After calming Lily, Diana and Luna returned to Steven&#x27;s villa.</p><p style="text-align:left;">To make things easier for work, Diana arranged for Luna to stay in the small courtyard behind the house, next door to Evan.</p><p style="text-align:left;">When she got back inside, she went to prepare dinner but noticed Steven was still out.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She hadn&#x27;t told him she was home, and he had no idea.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Changing into comfortable clothes, she headed downstairs to cook.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Just as she entered the kitchen, her phone buzzed with a message from Steven.</p><p style="text-align:left;">[I&#x27;ll be home for dinner tonight.]</p><p style="text-align:left;">Surprised he knew she was back, Diana continued preparing the meal.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jean was planning to make her move in the morning, and Diana was curious about how the situation would unfold.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="810.html">« Prev</a><a href="812.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
