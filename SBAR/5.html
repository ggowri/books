Even if Queenie were being vicious, he would still protect and cherish her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Well?" A majestic and old voice came from beside her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana felt a chill on her back. She turned her head to look at the older man beside her, and tears instantly burst out.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Grandpa!" Diana shouted excitedly, never expecting that her grandfather would come to pick her up.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Leopold was the man who raised her, so she took him as her real&nbsp;grandfather, who loved her the most.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There was no expression on Leopold's weathered face, only anger. Steven and the Marsh family should pay for how much they've made his granddaughter suffer!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Leopold glared at her. "Don't cry. I'm not dead yet."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana smiled, thinking about how her grandfather was heartbroken after she died in her previous life and passed away a year later.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was such a terrible granddaughter!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The more Diana thought about it, the sadder she became, and finally, she burst into tears again.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The handsome man driving the car gripped the steering wheel tightly, wishing he could cut that bastard Steven into pieces.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Now you know how to cry?" Leopold was angry and distressed, glaring at her with his beard puffed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana cried out of breath, "Grandpa, Tobias, I'm crying because I know how stupid I have been!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Leopold swallowed back the curse that was about to come out of his mouth.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Leopold's eldest grandson, Tobias Bishop, and his two brothers grew up with Diana together.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Hey..." Tobias laughed. "Diana, you finally come around."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana's tears slowly stopped, and she pulled out a tissue to wipe her nose, making a racket. </p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Leopold raised his eyebrows with a bit disdain and shut his eyes. "Act properly. I raised you to be a classy lady!" </p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana awkwardly tossed the tissue in the trash and said between sobs, "Grandpa... I'm just so emotional seeing you again...hiccup!" </p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mind your manners!" Leopold scolded her again.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana just smiled.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This time, she had to protect her grandfather and brothers. In the previous life, Tobias was secretly killed by Queenie's hired killer as he tried to avenge Diana. </p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She must protect them and rewrite their fate.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She would tear off Queenie's mask and then do whatever she wanted.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tobias glanced&nbsp;at her casually. "Diana, want to go out and unwind?" &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana nodded eagerly. "Yes! I'm heading to the tropical rainforest." &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Leopold nearly jumped up, glaring at her. "Where do you think you're going?!" &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His booming voice startled both Diana and Tobias. &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana shrank back a little and explained softly, "Grandpa, I've been resting for a few years, and it's time for me to get out there and gain some new experience." &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was ready to live her life fully and for herself. &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Leopold thought it over, figuring she could use some life lessons, and agreed, "I'll give you three months. If you don't make it back, I'll pretend I never raised you." &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana smiled confidently, a reassuring grin on her face. &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Grandpa, I'll come back safe and sound. I&rsquo;ll stay with you, take care of you until you..." She stopped herself just in time. &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Well..." She giggled awkwardly. &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Leopold glared at her. Until he dies? This silly girl didn't think before she spoke!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But he then nodded with satisfaction. "Good! Tobias, send Diana over there, and take her&nbsp;back after she has cleared her mind."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tobias smiled, sent his grandfather home, and took Diana directly to the rainforest on a private plane.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Three months later.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At the international airport.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana gave off a relaxed vibe in her black tights, her figure toned and sexy after three months of exercise, with a cool aura that kept people at a distance. </p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her hair was pulled back in a high ponytail, showing off her fair, delicate face and sharp, indifferent eyes. </p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">People passing by looked at her with amazement. </p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She pushed her luggage along. Once outside the airport, she checked the time and realized Luna, who was supposed to pick her up, hadn't arrived yet.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Didn't she say she has arrived?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana took a deep breath and looked at the familiar city. She was finally back.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, a familiar cold voice came. "Diana, where have you been?!"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="4.html">« Prev</a><a href="6.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
