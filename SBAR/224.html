Why was it in the wardrobe? There was half a glass of wine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He closed his eyes and then opened them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The wine was still there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff almost collapsed. He quickly put the wine away to hide it from Paula. Yet he grew more and more frightened, and even the muscles of his face shook. He suspected that he was very, very sick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven returned to his office across the street.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan told him that the receptionist and Emma had already left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The design department needed a new designer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven thought of Diana's strong hatred and actually felt somewhat uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He sat in his chair with a casual posture.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sunlight shone through the floor-to-ceiling windows, adding a layer of warm light to him, but his face was exceptionally handsome.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan stood aside and watched in silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After this incident, Steven and Diana might never be together again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Evan was lost in thought, Steven asked coldly, "Have you found out about that man?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan shook his head. "Mr. Gellar, there are more than 20 hotels in Capitole, and I am still checking them one by one."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven frowned. Queenie was very cautious. The investigation should take a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He beckoned Evan out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, he took out his cell phone and called Gale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale answered the call quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven, I was about to call you. Diana suddenly came over and claimed that I stole her design drawings and gave them to your company. She wrongly accused me, didn't she?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven stood up with an icy expression. "Gale, Diana has been here. She also showed the video of you taking the photos. By the way, the design director of my company admitted that you sent her the design drawings."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale laughed angrily. "Steven, do you believe Diana's lies?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Another possibility is that she and the design director colluded to frame me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven sighed, "So, she had such a hard time in your family, and I was not kind to her. There was a reason for that. We were blind and heartless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Gale, Diana is your biological sister, but your family has announced that she is an adopted daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As her family, if you disgust her, who else do you expect to like her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's good for her to cut off ties with your family. At least she doesn't have to face a shameless brother like you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If the evidence is handed over to the police, you will be imprisoned for more than ten years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Having a brother like you and a husband like me should be the most painful experience in her life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, I really didn't do that. I admit that I took the photos, but I didn't send them to anyone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale was anxious. The ten-year imprisonment scared him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Gale, Emma told me that you sent the photos to her. Why don't you dare to admit it?" Steven asked angrily and hung up the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had no right to scold Gale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Back then, even with the evidence, he would not believe Diana once Queenie said something to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He smashed his phone and glanced out the floor-to-ceiling windows with a heavy heart.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="223.html">« Prev</a><a href="225.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
