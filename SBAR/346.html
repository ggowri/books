He would catch grouper for her and make steamed grouper. He would also catch blue crabs for her and stir-fry spicy crabs for her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then I'll take you there once this summer. When lambis are in season, I'll take you to pick them. I love to eat them."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tom smiled and almost danced with joy, "That's great, Diana. Then you have to make time to go with me."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana thought for a moment and said, "We can go on the weekend. The sea water isn't that cold now."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can we go next week?" Tom even wanted to go today. Winter was coming soon, and it would be freezing.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shook her head. She thought, "With his swimming skills, he can't even dive.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's very dangerous when he's in the sea."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She laughed angrily. "Tom, use your weekends to go to the swimming pool and practice your swimming skills first. I will take you diving in a while. Next year, I will take you to the island where I used to live. I am familiar with there and know what seafood is available in which season."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tom was sad. He probably couldn't go this year. He promised, "Diana, I will practice my swimming skills hard. Wait for me."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled and let him go in to accompany his cousin, who was recovering well.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, Diana arranged the work and left the hospital.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph followed Diana all the way. He watched her arrange everything and get into a car on the side of the road before leaving.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's ethereal voice was still lingering in his mind.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had never met such a beautiful and kind girl. Every move she made attracted him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Until Diana's car had left for a long time and the cold wind blew, he turned back.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After walking a few steps, his cell phone vibrated. He looked down and saw that Diana transferred some money to him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Joseph, don't go to work for the time being. Take good care of your grandma and study hard.]</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph brightly smiled.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With trembling fingers, he replied: [Okay! I will study hard.]</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana returned home, took a shower, and lay comfortably on the bed. She called Cecil, and the call actually went through.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, I was just about to call you. Have you found Luna? I just came out of the police station."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana said, "Luna has been found. I'm glad you're okay."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, Queenie insisted that I wanted to rape her. When my grandma came in with the video to prove my innocence, I saw her face turn terrible.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jace was shaking with anger. This old man probably didn't expect that Luna would get evidence even though his people were capturing her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't have my cell phone with me at the time. Otherwise, I would have taken a video for you." Cecil's voice was full of laughter.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana felt that he couldn't be like this. "Cecil, she didn't plan against you this time. There will be a bigger plan waiting for you next time. This time, it was Luna who secretly filmed the video and helped you. Otherwise, you really can't explain it.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"From the way she and Jace are together, it's likely that the two are in cahoots with each other."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jace was very ambitious.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was still worried that Cecil was too arrogant.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil heard that and couldn't laugh anymore.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "Isn't it?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These times, it was Diana who got the evidence and saved me. Queenie's methods are really endless."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil became serious. "Diana, I will pay attention. It's too late. You should go to bed early. I'll talk to you tomorrow. I'll take grandma back first."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana said, "Okay! Be careful."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hung up the phone and lay down to sleep. She was very sleepy.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie did not return to the Marsh Villa.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ever since her grandparents came, it was filled with the sound of her grandma bossing her around. It was too annoying. So she moved into the apartment that Steven had bought for her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After entering the door, she kicked off her high heels. Her body was shaking with anger.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mario followed behind her. Seeing her angry, he whispered with his eyes full of malice, "Ms. Marsh, Cecil has been able to escape with the help of Diana these few times. Next time, let's choose an occasion where Diana is not around. Then, no one can save him."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie threw her bag on the sofa. Her gloomy face was vicious.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was puzzled. "Diana was indeed in the countryside when she was found. What is her relationship with that old man?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="345.html">« Prev</a><a href="347.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
