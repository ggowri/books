"Don't you understand? Diana is the real president of the Azure Group. Many people don't know who the president is. They only know Nolan is the CEO.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If it weren't for the surveillance at home, I wouldn't have known. I would still be in the dark.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is why, when Madam Farley had an accident at the swimming pool, Diana could get the hotel surveillance footage and confidently break Cecil's arms. The hotel belongs to her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven finally understood how deeply Diana had hidden her true self.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was a racer, a designer, and the president of the Azure Group. She might have other identities he didn't know.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The country bumpkin they always looked down upon was the hidden boss in the shadows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking back to how he used to look down on Diana, Steven felt a burning shame.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan paused in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't believe Diana was the president of the Azure Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As layers of mystery peeled away, her identity seemed unreachable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven stopped talking and continued to watch Diana eat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was in a good mood today. Queenie and George were hospitalized, meaning she could have a peaceful Christmas.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Those two wouldn't bother him anymore, and he wouldn't let them harm Diana again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan, seeing Luna's joyful expression, also felt happy. Luna had him in her heart. He had to return quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After playing dead to deceive George, who thought he was gone, he had to return to Luna as soon as possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At Paula's house, only she, Gale, and Eric were celebrating Christmas together. It was the quietest celebration they ever had.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In previous years, she would start preparing Christmas gifts for Queenie and the whole family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She would spend millions of dollars on custom dresses for Queenie without batting an eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She would only give a few thousand dollars to dismiss Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula looked out at the snowy scene. On Christmas day, it continued to snow heavily, making the outside world a bleak gray, which mirrored her somber mood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only the fireworks shooting into the sky, with their dazzling colors in the night, gave her a sense of the festive spirit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought Diana was spending Christmas alone too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was with Queenie now, the ending she had always wished for.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A man like Steven, no matter how wealthy, wasn't good enough for Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was determined to avenge Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, Queenie would be sent to hell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff would soon face retribution.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale, sitting in his wheelchair, saw her staring out the window in a daze and felt a deep sorrow for her. "Mom, are you thinking about Diana?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula showed no joy for Christmas. "Yes, in previous years, none of us cared about her. Every year, she would give us gifts, but we despised them, often discarding them in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What blinded our kindness? That's my daughter. How could I be so heartless to her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula sighed deeply, "It's my fault for not raising you properly, to the point where you all wanted to eliminate her. If she hadn't been capable, she would have been destroyed by you all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale and Eric felt immense guilt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They had opposed Diana for Queenie as if under a spell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking back now, they realized how wrong they had been.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, Diana is getting better now. As long as she's happy, we'll work hard to earn her forgiveness."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if she never forgave them, it didn't matter. They wished only for her peace and happiness in the days ahead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric said, "Mom, don't be too sad. Let's eat dinner first. Although this year's celebration isn't as vibrant, with no luxurious gifts or joyful laughter, we are being true to ourselves. We're no longer deceived by Queenie's sweet words and won't wrong Diana again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric felt a pang of regret. "For the past two years, we threw away Diana's gifts in front of her because we thought they were worthless. Although we are her brothers, we treated her worse than strangers. I'm prepared to never be forgiven."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula felt deep sorrow. This year, she had prepared an expensive gift for Diana, but she knew she could never give it to Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her eyes glistened with tears. On this festive day, she didn't want her emotions to affect her sons.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, let's eat," she said softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale and Eric smiled faintly, bowing their heads to eat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No matter how good the food was, it tasted bland in their mouths.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They didn't know if it was their changed palate or if the fewer people and simpler atmosphere compared to previous years made the meal less enjoyable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula sighed as she ate, finding it hard to swallow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She truly regretted it. She shouldn't have looked down on Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After dinner, Paula asked Eric to take care of Gale while she returned to her room alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her room, she saw the champagne-colored dress in the wardrobe, adorned with luxurious pearls and gems. It was a beautiful dress worth a million dollars, prepared for Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The color suited Diana perfectly. Since returning to the Marsh family, she had never treated Diana sincerely. No wonder Diana felt so disappointed and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula covered her face and wept.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fireworks exploded in the night sky, colorful like a brilliant painting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Each firework blossomed like a flower, or twinkled like a star, illuminating the night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula stood by the window, her face tear-streaked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The fireworks shot straight into the sky, coloring the city sky with brilliant hues.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With each crackle of the fireworks, her sobs grew louder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, I'm sorry. I was wrong. You longed for my love, but I wouldn't even look at you. Diana, it's my fault," she cried out in anguish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her sorrow was drowned in the noise of fireworks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric brought water to her, and when he opened the door, he saw her weeping in pain. His hand tightened around the cup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He too was deeply sorrowful. They all regretted their actions. Silently, he withdrew, stood on the balcony, and pulled out his phone to call Diana.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="961.html">« Prev</a><a href="963.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
