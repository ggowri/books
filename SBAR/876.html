"Paula, I'm sorry. I was wrong. I admit it. Back then, I only approached you because you were wealthy and the only child of your family. But I swear I didn't know Amelie was deceiving me, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The idea of swapping Queenie and Diana was hers. Diana is my biological daughter too. I was just... momentarily confused when I agreed to it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula narrowed her eyes. She realized that he still didn't know the whole truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she first learned Diana was her daughter, she didn't think much of it. Diana was her child, so it was only natural to love her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she hadn't known Jeff had already swapped the children.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All her affection had gone to Queenie instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of it kept Paula awake at night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough," Paula interrupted him, her voice filled with pain. She glared at him furiously. "Jeff, you'll do anything for money, won't you? You lied to me, cheated </span><span>on </span><span>me, and deceived me for so many years. Do you even have a conscience?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff scrambled to explain. "Paula, of course I have a conscience! I just made the kind of mistake any man could make..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop disgusting me. You couldn't let go of my money, could you? I did everything for you. I protected your pride, helped you start a company, and what did I get in return? Betrayal. Someone like you deserves to rot in hell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff lowered his head in shame, seeing her cry out of anger. He was older now, and regret weighed heavily on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Paula's temperament. She would never forgive him in this lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could choose again, he'd pick the gentle and kind Paula, not the selfish and manipulative Amelie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, Paula."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula let out a cold laugh. Her voice dripped with sarcasm. "Sorry? Do you even qualify to apologize? Diana was right. You should look into your son abroad. Are you sure he's really yours?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie had sent their son overseas, likely to hide some unspeakable secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I met Mrs. Foliot last night," Paula continued. "She uncovered some things. Before Mr. Foliot married her, he was hung up on someone else. That someone was Amelie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula glared at Jeff, her anger blazing. These people were all the same: shameless and willing to trample any moral boundary for luxury and wealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought back to her younger days when she'd been pregnant with Gale during university.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been full of joy, anticipating the arrival of her child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their life back then seemed perfect, but it had all been a carefully crafted illusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was stunned. He couldn't believe Amelie would do such a thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie knew Paula and Diana were trying to drive a wedge between her parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clung to Jeff's arm. "Dad, don't listen to them. My brother is definitely your biological son. They're just trying to drive a wedge between us because they don't want us to be happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even Queenie couldn't deny her brother's incompetence. Despite all the money Jeff had poured into him, the business was a complete failure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Steven had turned the Gellar Group into an untouchable powerhouse in Capitole in just a few years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff thought about it and decided Queenie was probably right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula and Diana hated him. They wanted to see him suffer, so of course, they'd try to sow discord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But honestly, his relationship with Amelie was already crumbling. No one needed to interfere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie loved money, and so did he.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paula," Jeff began, "I know you're angry, and I get that being deceived is painful. But isn't life just like this? You were beautiful, wealthy, and an only child in your family back then. Men didn't approach you without ulterior motives. I wasn't the only one who wanted to take advantage of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula's body trembled. She had known this for years, but hearing him say it aloud still stung.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her youth, she had been a campus star, always dressed in trendy shorts and tops. She was rich, beautiful, and full of life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Married men coveted her. Single men chased after her. Women envied her. But her heart had belonged to the ambitious, upstanding Jeff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, he had seemed driven and principled. That was the version of him she had fallen for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was all an act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone who approached her with ulterior motives would naturally have studied her thoroughly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had taken her decades to learn the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula forced herself to let go of those useless memories. She fixed her gaze on Jeff and Queenie. "Are you here to trouble Diana again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff had brought Queenie to find Steven, hoping to gain his sympathy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he heard Diana had a cure for cold-related ailments, he thought about Queenie's future. If her condition could be treated, she might still marry well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Diana had given the medicine to Evan and not Queenie, which had infuriated him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paula, we may not get along, but the kids are family. Queenie is Diana's older sister. That's a fact," he said shamelessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Talk to Diana. Don't let her be so heartless. Just one pill. You've loved Queenie like your own daughter. Can you really bear to see her suffer?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was playing the emotional card, hoping Paula's soft heart would work in his favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was wrong. Paula had woken up. Now, she only cared about her five children.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her fury reached a boiling point. The veins on her forehead throbbed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jeff! Queenie! The two of you are absolutely shameless. Get out! What right do you have to come to my daughter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She owes you nothing. You're the ones who owe her. How dare you even show your faces in front of Diana?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave!" Paula shouted, her anger uncontrollable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie sneered. "Paula, look at yourself. You're nothing like a lady anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula laughed coldly. "And you? Look at yourself. You're nothing but a lowly woman. You're not even worthy to compare to my daughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My daughter is noble, and no matter what, you'll never measure up to her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie stomped her foot in frustration. "Paula, I regret not angering you to death sooner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since they'd already torn all pretenses, she didn't bother holding back anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula's laughter was icy. "What a pity. You'll never get the chance now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula was livid, but she still carried herself with elegance. She still looked composed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only her eyes betrayed the frost of her fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie faltered under Paula's piercing glare, taking an instinctive step back.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="875.html">« Prev</a><a href="877.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
