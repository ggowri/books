She understood that it was because of how cruel the last life had been for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been even crueler for her, but she had come to terms with it. Knowing that it wasn't Steven who had killed her and her child, the hatred in her heart mysteriously faded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gave a faint smile as she watched the handsome man in front of her, looking so anxious. His lips were tightly pressed together, and his charming eyes were focused intently on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She slowly said, "Cecil, don't worry. We have to accept our fate. No one knows what will happen next."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I think you know what kind of person Queenie will become after this." Cecil was curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought for a moment and felt that at this point, there was no need to hide anything from him. "From what I know, she will kill everyone around her, stepping on them to rise to the top. In the end, she will become the most dazzling business queen and the kindest and most gentle one in people's hearts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, Queenie's reputation had already been destroyed. Her path wouldn't be as smooth as it was in the past because Diana wouldn't allow it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was stunned. He looked at Diana's calm and composed face, and somehow, his nervous heart seemed to be soothed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked softly, "Diana, did even Steven die at her hands?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "I don't know how he died. By that time, my heart had already been shattered by him. The people I least wanted to see every day were them, so they aren't the same person. I didn't know until this time. Cecil, don't be afraid. Everything will be fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart felt unsettled. His eyes were filled with disbelief, unable to accept that such a fantastical thing could happen in his world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, with your comfort, I'm not afraid. But I feel like this whole situation is happening too fast. Zion was a top agent in the industry. No one dared to mess with him. He has power and means. All of his artists are superstars. Now that it's revealed he's been involved in shady business, not only the netizens, but even I find it hard to believe. I've had meals with him and even chatted with him a few times. He was always eloquent and charming and looked at people with a gentle smile. I never expected that beneath his refined facade, there was such a malicious heart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana laughed and teased him, "Cecil, I remember when we first met, you also said Queenie was beautiful, gentle, and kind, while I was a vicious woman. You even slapped me twice because of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil looked at his hand, feeling a sense of grievance. At that time, he had been deceived by Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, the biggest regret of my life is that I slapped you. But you also taught me a lesson. The feeling of having both my hands broken by you was unbearable. I felt like I was living a life worse than death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But don't worry, I've learned my lesson. I will never do anything to hurt you again. I just want to know, what do we do next?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was truly worried. Queenie's malice far surpassed Zion's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had always mentioned that Queenie had an elite team behind her, but Cecil hadn't been able to find anything about them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was too strange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clues stopped when they reached Felicity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled. At that moment, she was incredibly calm. Her pale face seemed to glow with the vivid smile on her red lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next, Queenie will swallow up Zion's company. She will take everything she can.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She has an elite team behind her that can instantly transfer those assets into her name without getting caught. What we need to do now is wait for them to buy the land. Once the project fails, the next step is to uncover the elite team behind her. Once we expose them and bring Queenie down, we'll be safe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana closed the laptop. She had to go pick up Olivia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Cecil. There was no rush, and they needed time. "Cecil, you should head back. For now, Queenie won't have time to target us just yet. I'm going to pick up Olivia. She's coming back tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, let me go with you. I also want to thank Olivia for saving my father last time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a metaphysical master. She could save his father's life even from across the country. He felt he owed her and needed to personally welcome her. Some things, he couldn't help but believe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought for a moment. "Alright, let's go together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana asked Luna to drive, and the three of them headed to the airport to pick up Olivia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three hours later, they returned to the city, and Cecil invited them to have dinner at his restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coincidentally, they ran into Queenie and Mario, who were also there for dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Queenie was in a wheelchair, she still looked exquisitely made up, her appearance and makeup were flawless. It was as if the scandalous news surrounding her, with the film being pulled, didn't exist. She looked like an indifferent bystander, just there to watch the show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Cecil saw her, he couldn't help but admire her courage. Even though her reputation was in ruins, she still had the composure to casually dine out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie noticed Cecil and Diana and merely smiled faintly, "Cecil, Diana, what a coincidence. How was today's little game? Did you find it thrilling and exciting? Especially you, Mr. Farley, did you feel a little uneasy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil didn't know how to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "What does she mean by that? Why would I feel uneasy?" But, despite his confusion, Queenie's words had a ring of truth. He was feeling a bit uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His handsome face was filled with a wicked grin, his proud eyes looking down on Queenie. "Queenie, what do you mean by that? Why should I be feeling uneasy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at him with a weird smile and pointed at his limbs. "Tsk! I was thinking about how I was going to chop off your limbs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..." Cecil felt a sharp pain all over his body, a pain he had felt in his dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes narrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, what nonsense are you talking about?" He didn't believe it. How extreme could Queenie get?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie snorted and looked at Diana, mocking, "Diana, turns out you're also a bastard with an unknown father."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A gust of cold wind howled through the open window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's heart gave a slight shiver, and she felt an increasing chill run through her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had only learned about that matter earlier that morning, and even she was shocked by it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what could she do? She couldn't change her origins. All she could do was accept her fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face darkened, but she remained silent. Time passed slowly, and the hall seemed to be enveloped by a heavy, oppressive atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie quietly stared at Diana, watching her with a faint smile. She felt much calmer now after knowing Diana was also an illegitimate child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha..." Diana let out a soft laugh. "Queenie, if thinking that way makes you feel better, then go ahead and keep that thought."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, she waved her hand, signaling Olivia to push her inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was nothing left to say between her and Queenie.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="988.html">« Prev</a><a href="990.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
