Apart from my face, there is nothing good about me. I am very strong. I just turned 18 and don't have a good job yet."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana couldn't help but burst out laughing.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was stunning when she smiled. Joseph stared at her blankly for a moment.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had seen countless beauties, but it was the first time he had seen such an innocent and beautiful woman. She had no scheming, and her eyes were bright and clear, giving people infinite favor.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You are so cute. I have no shortage of men, nor do I lack strong men. I help you not because of you but because of your grandmother. It is a piece of cake for me. If you really want to repay me, I will send you to study abroad. After you finish your studies, you can come to work in my company. It will also be considered as helping me."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph was surprised. He thought, "How could such a good thing happen to me?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Take me to see your grandmother. My sister is having a physical examination, and I will go to see her later."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph looked at her kind smile and finally let down his guard. Then, he took her to see his grandmother, Priya Wood.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The ward was small, and there were two patients in it.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Diana went in, Joseph walked to Priya&zwnj;'s bedside. "Grandma."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Joseph, you're back. I'm fine now. Let's be discharged from the hospital." Priya&zwnj; was in her seventies and had gray hair. Her face was pale due to illness.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph explained, "Grandma, I brought a doctor here. Let her check your body first, okay?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Priya&zwnj; looked at Diana behind him and nodded. "Is this lady the doctor?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes!" Joseph moved aside and let Diana check Priya&zwnj;.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana sat by the bed and checked Priya&zwnj;. A few minutes later, she saw the medical records and test results by the bed. She picked up the CT scan results and saw that the tumor was not small.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, based on her previous treatment experience, she knew that there was no need for surgery and that another treatment method could be used. It just so happened that their hospital had this technology.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked at Joseph. "I need transfer your grandmother to another hospital tonight. The surgery must be done as soon as possible."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph looked at her serious expression and knew that Priya was in a severe condition.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Doctor, I'm fine. I don't feel any pain. I'll go home and take some medicine." Priya thought, "I have used up all my savings, and Joseph is a good student. I'm old and am about to die. I can't delay his future studies.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He must finish college before he can live a good life in the future. He has had a hard life since childhood."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana told her, "Don't worry. Our hospital has a lucky user, and you have been selected. All the expenses from now on will be free. So, don't worry. But we have to transfer you to another hospital first. Your condition is a bit serious. You will get better after treatment there."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Priya&zwnj; was surprised. She thought, "Could it really be such a good thing?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I heard from Dr. Cruz that my illness can not be cured. I have lived long enough and can not drag down my grandson any longer. If I can hold on for another two years, I can earn some tuition for my grandson."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Priya&zwnj; said, "Girl, you are so beautiful. Don't lie to me. I have nothing left but my grandson. It doesn't matter whether I get treated or not. But my grandson must go to school. The teacher said he has good grades..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana interrupted her with a smile, "Don't worry. I will solve his study problems. But you have to promise me that you will get treatment well. Don't you want to see your grandson getting better and better?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="342.html">« Prev</a><a href="344.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
