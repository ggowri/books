"I forgive you. I'm starving. Let's grab some lunch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely!" George said, leading her to the car and driving off, leaving Andrew standing there alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew was so furious that he felt like he could tear them apart, but there was nothing he could do now that they were long gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the Gellar Manor, Olivia looked at Helen, trying to comfort her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Gellar, neither of them is in danger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Helen and Diana let out a sigh of relief at the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen turned to Diana, and her heart ached at the thought of leaving her to face everything alone. But perhaps this was a necessary lesson for her. "Diana, I might just be a burden here. I'll go abroad to find Leopold and assist you from the shadows. That way, you can openly operate while I work behind the scenes to help you capture them all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana quickly replied, "Helen, it's almost the end of the year. Let me take you there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia, noticing Diana's difficulty moving around, interjected, "Diana, you can't manage that right now. I'll help you get her abroad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt deeply touched. Olivia had always been so supportive. "Olivia, I can't thank you enough. I'll arrange for someone to get you both abroad right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen staying behind could indeed become a liability for Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never imagined that behind Queenie, there was a man who looked exactly like Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Diana made arrangements for Olivia and Helen to leave, the afternoon had already rolled in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna drove her back to Steven's villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon entering, the place felt eerily empty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna switched on the lights and said, "Diana, all the surveillance footage from the hospital has been destroyed. I tried to fix it several times, but no luck!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've looked for Evan, but he's still missing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna's worry for Evan was palpable. She had called him, but though the call went through, no one picked up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana gazed out the window, her emotions a tangled mess. "Luna, they'll be fine. Don't stress too much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She believed that Steven must have everything planned out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears suddenly streamed down Luna's face. "Diana, I can't bear the thought of something happening to Evan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her cry made Diana's eyes well up, too. She felt the same pain, knowing the truth and how torturous it was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She recalled Steven's furious shout, "Diana, you don't deserve to say you love me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought, "So, Steven must have known all along that the man behind Queenie looked just like him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how could he have known?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she remembered Steven's words. "Diana, I'm not dirty. I've never touched Queenie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "He was telling the truth. He really hasn't touched her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder those photos weren't edited. They were taken intentionally by Queenie and that man to provoke me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, did Steven realize from the start that Queenie had ulterior motives?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or was it because I showed him the photos that she sent me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my past life, Steven died early on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The later version of him was a completely different person from the man I once knew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, as I look back at the timeline, he shortly died after I did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the man behind Queenie took Steven's place without anyone noticing, not even me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, did I really love Steven?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I loved him, why didn't I see that they were two different people?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, that's not it. It's different this time. In my past life, I was heartbroken, always keeping my distance from Steven and Queenie. I didn't hear a word they said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, the moment that man spoke, I recognized he wasn't Steven."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she pieced everything together, tears streamed down Diana's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could this happen?" she murmured to herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna went to prepare dinner while Diana sat there, lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Luna finished cooking and stepped out, she was met with the sight of Diana. Her face was streaked with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana," Luna said gently, kneeling beside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Luna's voice snapped Diana out of her daze. "What is it, Luna?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Understanding the weight of Diana's sorrow, Luna said, "I've made two plates of pasta. Let's eat dinner first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," Diana replied, determined to regain her strength so she could find Steven and Evan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna wheeled her to the dining table, where she had prepared two plates of pasta, each adorned with fish balls, fried eggs, and fresh greens, which were light and delicious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Diana lowered her head to eat, her thoughts drifted. "It's been three days and nights. Where could Steven be with Queenie and that man?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mere thought of Steven possibly being in danger made her heart race with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pondered, "Is this second chance a gift from fate to help me uncover these truths?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my past life, I fell to my death, filled with resentment, and it hurt so much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of this pain came from that man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana finished her pasta, setting down her fork. She looked at Luna and said, "Luna, please clean up and get some rest. Don't worry too much. I've been waiting for the person behind Queenie to show himself, and now that he has, I can't hold back any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tomorrow, you'll go to Steven's company first thing. Tell the PR department to announce that I am now the president of the Gellar Group. Anyone who disagrees can head to HR to collect their paychecks and go home. Queenie might try to turn the tables on me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll think of a plan tonight, so don't worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna trusted Diana's abilities and felt reassured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, Diana."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana took the elevator to the second floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Luna tried calling Evan again, but still no answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had grown fond of Evan; he was a good man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she saved his life, Evan became attached to her, even promising to dedicate himself to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna didn't mind Evan's affection at all, but now that he was missing, worry gnawed at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna dialed Evan's number a couple more times without success before she finally went to wash the dishes. Her anxiety had left her parched. She had never felt this way about anyone before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had someone keeping an eye on Queenie, hoping news would come soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After washing the dishes, Luna received a message from the bodyguard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quickly glancing at the message, she rushed upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was getting ready to wash up and go to bed when she saw Luna enter. "Did you hear anything from Queenie?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna nodded, saying, "Diana, Queenie took that 'Mr. Gellar' to meet Zion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mention of Zion sent a shiver down Diana's spine. He was a terrifying figure known for his charming smile that concealed a ruthless and violent nature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zion's agency is thriving right now. Keep a close watch. Queenie won't let this opportunity slip by. She's a master at operating in the shadows."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it!" Luna replied, putting her phone back in her bag before gently guiding Diana toward the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, let me help you."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="908.html">« Prev</a><a href="910.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
