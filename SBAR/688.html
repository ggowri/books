It was evident that he had thought the wrong way.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven didn't notice his expression. He went into his office and called Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, Steven." Queenie's voice was gentle.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's voice was cold and cruel. "Queenie, I reminded you not to target Diana."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was startled when she heard his eerie voice. But she was angry because Steven called her for Diana. "Steven, I didn't do it. How could I have the ability to frame her? Jasmine stood up for me herself. I really didn't do anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven sat on the sofa, his cold and aloof aura making people afraid to approach him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether it's you or not, you know it well. I warned you. She is my wife. To defame her is to defame me, Queenie. I have no tolerance for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven then hung up the phone and asked Evan to come in.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eyes were filled with anger, but his voice was still steady. "Suppress the Staggs family and prepare to acquire the Staggs family's company. Tell Jasmine that if she is Queenie's dog, she must have the courage to bear the consequences."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was slightly surprised, his eyes full of joy. "Mr. Gellar, are you going to help Mrs. Gellar?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned. "Shouldn't I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan shook his head and said, "No. I'm just a little surprised. You never cared about anything that happened to Mrs. Gellar before. It is the first time you want to help Mrs. Gellar. So, I feel quite surprised."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's heart suddenly trembled. He thought, "Diana has taken care of me for two years. Have I never helped Diana?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood up irritably and said, "Deal with it immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan shook his head and said, "I'm afraid Mrs. Gellar won't appreciate it. When Mrs. Gellar needed you the most, she didn't get your help and trust."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had lost all her goodwill with Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan finished speaking. Then, he didn't care about Steven's expression and ran out of the office as if he was escaping for his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, Steven was immersed in Evan's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "It seems that I have never treated Diana well.And I took Diana's efforts for granted."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing that he was wrong, Steven suddenly realized that everything she did seemed to be forced by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, divorce had been what he wanted most. But after Diana agreed to the divorce and signed, he suddenly didn't want to divorce anymore for some reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had once thought Queenie was the kindest person.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought Diana often plotted against Queenie because she was jealous.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie sometimes exaggerated, but Steven pretended not to notice it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had understood one thing since he was a child. No one in this world truly loved him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's grandparents had a responsibility to him. Perhaps they loved him, but that was not all.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven also didn't have the ability to love. He had thought he loved Queenie, but he didn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Queenie went to bed with other men, he felt nothing but disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had been around Steven all day long, and Steven found her annoying. He believed that a woman should love herself and have her own life.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was wrong. Diana's expression had shown her love for him. Because she cared about him, she would pay attention to everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Diana with other men, Steven would be angry and jealous. After she left, he felt like something was missing in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven thought he had just gotten used to Diana's presence. But half a year had passed, and the missing piece in his heart gradually grew bigger.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="687.html">« Prev</a><a href="689.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
