"You little wildcat. This is actually a bit painful. I'll come to you to apply medicine tonight. If you dare to refuse to open the door, I'll announce to the whole world that you are my wife."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana blinked, thinking, "Has he gone mad? Does he think this reason can threaten me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, as long as you don't mind making Queenie the scorned mistress, then announce it to the whole world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana wasn't afraid of him at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at her angry, ferocious-looking appearance and thought, "She looks so good even when she's angry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked up a coat from the side, dressed it elegantly, and said. "The winter design drawings are selling well. Take some time off to recover from your wound, and then prepare the spring design drawings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was furious. "I will not work for you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana," Steven interrupted her with a smile, his eyes filled with threat. "I just reminded you not to try to break my principles. My time is very valuable. I'm going to work now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven walked a few steps, then stopped and turned around to look at her. "You have no right to refuse. No one can change my thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The card on the table is my secondary card. Buy whatever you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven liked the feeling of having everything under control. Only with absolute control could he feel secure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana watched him leave, unable to say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn!"&nbsp;Diana screamed angrily. "How dare he plot against me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was so angry that her face turned red and her heart pounded. She picked up the phone on the table and called Olivia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the call was connected, Diana started crying, crying in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia was very worried. "Diana, why are you crying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uwah... Olivia, Steven, that bastard, he plotted against me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sat on the ground crying directly, feeling so sad. She had desperately tried to escape from Steven, but they were still tied together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it just for this? About the contract? It's not a big deal. Remember what I told you when I left? There was already a bond between you and him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Olivia, I don't want it. Find a way to sever my connection with him. I would rather be alone for life than face him as a husband. I'm sick of his hypocrisy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'd rather be lonely for a lifetime than deal with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia asked seriously, "Diana, it's impossible. The fate between you two has changed. What happened while I was away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said, "Nothing happened. I just came back from Althea's place. She had a cute son."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, it's okay. At worst, you just need to work for him for another three years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia comforted her with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt helpless. "Olivia, I really don't want any entanglement with him. I'm so tired, so tired. Steven's heart is made of stone. I can't move him. He's already infatuated with Queenie. I give up, truly give up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, let nature take its course. Whether it's the past or the present, everything is governed by fate. Some things are not meant to be or happen by chance. Follow your heart. I've almost finished dealing with things here. I'll be back to accompany you next week."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was very excited when she heard she was coming back. "Olivia, you didn't lie to me, right? Can you really come back next weekend?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="602.html">« Prev</a><a href="604.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
