I did take advantage of you. But didn't you enjoy it too? Look, you even scratched me all over. My back hurts a lot too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not just his back, his whole body hurt.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked down at the scratch marks on his abs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana blushed and couldn't say a word.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's... that's because you had no self-control. I... I told you to stop, but you still..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And still what?" Steven asked her with a faint smile. He felt sorry for her, but he couldn't control himself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For the first time, he felt what madness was like with her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "Diana, I've been abstinent for years, I couldn't help it. I'll be more careful next time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stay and sleep with me a little longer," Steven said, pulling her arm and holding her in his embrace, feeling immense satisfaction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana lay in his arms, looking at his toned abs, and said, "I'm hungry. My whole body hurts. I need a shower now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt sticky and uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven held her tightly, understanding what it felt like to completely have her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was overwhelmed with immense happiness, excitement and joy filling every cell of his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright! Let's lie down a bit longer, then we'll go shower," he said gently, kissing her face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana unhappily refused, "Stop. I'm in pain all over."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven comforted her, "Then I'll carry you over later."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No way." Diana was unhappy and very angry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wondered who drugged her last night.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't notice anything unusual about the strawberry-flavored cake.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven chuckled softly and said, "Diana, let's live a good life together, shall we?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana quickly replied, "No!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven slightly distanced himself from her, looked at her, and said, "Diana..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "I won't forgive you so quickly. You haven't even folded the hearts and roses yet, and you expect me to forgive you. Impossible."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm still angry. I've truly experienced real pain."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you know how it felt when I fell to my death? I died with hatred for you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop talking," Steven said painfully.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her angry face and said, "I'll do all of that. After lunch, I'll personally go buy the materials. I'll give them to you after I finish folding the hearts and roses."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Why does she care so much about this?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven didn't ask Diana. He decided to find the answer himself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Talk to me when you're done," Diana lightly poked his abs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His physique and looks were absolutely perfect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was furious!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she had been taken away by other women last night, she would have been furious enough to kill someone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But since it was Steven, she was angry but not as hateful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven became excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He whispered, "Diana, don't move recklessly, the consequences will be serious."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glared at him and said, "Steven, stop thinking about it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her restless hand on his chest and smiled, "You're the one teasing me. Diana, my self-control isn't as strong as you think. Holding you every night, I suppress my urges. You don't understand that feeling&mdash;it's painful."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana chuckled inwardly and pinched his chest hard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana suddenly said seriously, "It was you in the last life, why is it still you in this one? In the last life, I was also schemed against by Queenie, and later I got pregnant. Will I get pregnant this time?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's hand instinctively caressed her lower abdomen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He kissed her forehead and said, "Diana, of course, it will be me. The child must be ours too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your whole life belongs to me. I can't bear to let you go, and I won't let you go."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven would not let go of Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana trembled all over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph! Steven, you're too overbearing. I never agreed to have a child with you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven clearly knew she was sulking, but he was still angry. "Don't say such things again. Let's go bathe."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at his disappointed expression and was still very angry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said nothing, carrying her to the bathroom to bathe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bathtub was large, and after filling it with water, Steven gently placed Diana inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was very shy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You... you..." Before she could finish her words, Steven had already sat beside her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven saw bloodstains in the water.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He frowned and asked, "Why are you still bleeding?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was also confused.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nudged him and said, "You... you go out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven didn't move but lowered his head to check her wound.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When his hand touched her, Diana tried to stand up but was held down by Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't move. It'll be fine soon."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana buried her head in Steven's chest, letting him do as he pleased.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a long time, Steven smiled and said, "Diana, we are husband and wife."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stubbornly said, "Only people in love are husband and wife. What kind of relationship is this?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her with a smile and said, "Friends with benefits. Are you satisfied?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven got angry, making Diana want to run away just by looking at him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Twenty minutes later, Steven pulled a nearby towel to wrap them up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven carried her back to the room. He was only wearing a white bathrobe, with a gentle smile on his face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sneaked a glance at him and then lowered her head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had been hurt so much, yet she still couldn't forget the lover she once fell for at first sight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though she had once died and been hurt, seeing Steven later still gave her that same heart-fluttering feeling as before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana knew she shouldn't feel this way. But she had gone through so much just to see him.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1144.html">« Prev</a><a href="1146.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
