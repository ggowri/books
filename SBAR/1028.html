If that's true, I'll be so happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded and gave him a reassuring smile. "Yes, there will be no sequelae after detoxification. Cecil, believe in my medical skills." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, ask the lawyer to find Lillian later. My pills are 200,000 dollars each. You must ask her to compensate me. I don't want to be taken advantage of."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was very happy, his eyes sparkling with joy. His smile was really attractive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt like the entire world had brightened up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. Then I'm relieved. I'm worried that my bro can't get up, then I can't get married and have children." Cecil sounded a bit embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was still a virgin, and Cecil's words made her slightly confused for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked around and saw people looking at them. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She whispered, "Cecil, who is your bro? How come I didn't know you had a brother? I only remember that you had a sister abroad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was stunned and stared at Diana blankly as if he was looking at an idiot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Steven seems to have great sexual needs. He still hasn&rsquo;t sleep with Diana after they got married?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's innocent look made him want to kiss her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't dare. He dared to play with anyone, but not Diana. Because she was too innocent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil asked, "Diana, you&rsquo;ve never slept with Steven? He is young and energetic. Did he find Queenie to release his needs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was stunned and dumbfounded. So that was what Cecil meant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil blushed, and he didn't know how to explain. "Diana, um... I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked down at his crotch, not knowing how to answer her question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's talking about manhood. He's worried that he can't get an erection, can't get married, and have children." A low voice fell into Diana's ears, with a hint of anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana and Cecil looked at the man standing next to Diana. It was a strange man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his voice and figure were inexplicably familiar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana suddenly recognized this man. It was Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the man she loved deeply, and she almost recognized him at first glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He can stand up now?</span><span> She gasped secretly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil didn't recognize him, and he was very angry. "Hey! Who are you? Why are you eavesdropping on us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had a completely strange face at this time. But he looked at Cecil with cold eyes, as if Cecil had corrupted his woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lowered his eyes and looked at Diana. She was still a virgin. She shouldn't listen to these words. Strictly speaking, she was still a young girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Bishop, can we talk alone?" he asked in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was indeed waiting for Steven to show up, wanting to have a conversation with him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could say anything, Cecil said, "You are a stranger. What do you want to talk to Diana about? You can talk, but I must be there. Diana is so beautiful. What if </span><span>you're up to no good?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at him, coldness gleaming in his eyes. He couldn&rsquo;t believe Cecil stuck to Diana like a sticker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil felt a chill on his back when he came into contact with Steven's cold eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What the hell is this feeling? Who is this man? Why is his look so scary?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Somehow, Cecil felt that he was somewhat familiar but couldn't remember where he had seen him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at Cecil and met his worried eyes. She smiled brightly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cecil, it's okay. I know him. Go home and rest. You should reflect on what happened tonight. Think about how you were plotted against by Queenie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil became very angry just thinking about what happened tonight. He almost got screwed over by Queenie a few times before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I will expose what she did. I will ruin her reputation. I will make her a rat that everyone hates." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His beautiful eyes were full of coldness. He was so angry at the fact that Queenie tricked him again. If it weren't for Diana, his reputation would&rsquo;ve been ruined tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reputation and stocks of the Farley family would&rsquo;ve also been affected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana whispered to him, "Hold off for now. Wait for the perfect moment to reveal it. That's the only way it'll really work. What you did tonight didn&rsquo;t help." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, everyone saw Queenie's bad side, but when it comes to making money, nobody cares about that stuff. Hardly anyone climbing the ladder is squeaky clean, and everyone knows it. When there's money on the table, people focus on that, not someone else's scandals."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt sorry for him being set up by Queenie so many times. She wondered why he didn't learn his lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie knew exactly what kind of person Cecil was, so she tricked him again and again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, Queenie knows you all too well and knows how to deal with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was puzzled. "Diana, why does she know me so well?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana noticed that Steven was already impatient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Cecil's safety, she patted him on the shoulder. "Well, I'll contact you tonight. You should rest. You'll be feeling uncomfortable for a while. Go home and take a hot shower. The pills I gave you last time can also relieve your discomfort."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil looked at Steven and pondered if he had met him before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He whispered, "Diana, are you sure you know him? I'm worried about you going with a strange man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled and said, "I'm sure. I'm leaving. Go home and rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil looked at her reluctantly. "Oh! Okay! Diana, remember to call me when you get home. I want to make sure you get home safely so I can sleep well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled at his reluctant expression. He actually showed feelings for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Diana asked Luna to push her out and asked Nick to investigate Lillian. She knew that Queenie knew Lillian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The medicine used by Lillian came from the </span><span>Zephara</span><span> Region. Once that woman </span><span>showed up, Diana could dig out some useful info.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie would definitely get Lillian out of prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remembered that in her last life, Queenie had a doctor who was very good at medication. She could not cure diseases but could bewitch people. Maybe that doctor was Lillian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana lowered her head in thought and did not notice Steven's cold eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven realized that Diana really didn't care about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't seen him for a long time, but she was not as excited as she was when she saw him before. He became not essential in Diana's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's chest hurt, and it hurt more at this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they got downstairs, Diana asked Luna to push her to the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she got in the car, she told Luna, "Luna, stay nearby. Don't let anyone get close to our car."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna looked at her worriedly and asked, "Diana, who is he?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1027.html">« Prev</a><a href="1029.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
