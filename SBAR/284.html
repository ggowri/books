Once Callie's incident got out, she'd be blacklisted from the entertainment industry for good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She switched topics and casually mentioned Paige. "Hey, Frank, has Paige been bothering you since you got back?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank flashed a mischievous grin. "No. She's always going on about how wicked Elsie is. Well, I sent her a wedding invite. I want her to witness how happy Elsie and I are together. I want her to move on completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Elsie's the one I love. No matter what Paige does, she'll never change my feelings."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After his words, Frank felt satisfied, but there was also a pang of bitterness in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Deep down, he felt let down. Paige hadn't shown up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the past, whenever he returned, Paige would rush to see him, concerned about him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During the year he was away, Frank hadn't reached out to Paige. While he used to find her annoying, her absence now left him feeling uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As his wedding day approached, Frank felt depressed. When he wasn't with Elsie, he wanted to be by her side every moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, he missed Paige's affection and care.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he sent Paige a wedding invitation, she was quite calm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Recalling Paige's past kindness and her current absence, Frank couldn't help but feel sad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige had been obsessed with him. They were not just classmates; they were also desk buddies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They had gone to high school and college together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For six years, Paige had been by his side, bringing him breakfast every day and showing genuine care.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, Frank never reciprocated her feelings. Perhaps her forwardness had made him uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Taking a deep breath, Frank felt something had changed within him since that night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their separation saddened him deeply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie said, "Frank, Diana and Paige are close. Be cautious; don't let Paige set you up. Gale once fell victim to Diana and Althea's schemes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If it weren't for that incident, Gale and Penelope would have been married.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But Gale now..." Queenie feigned regret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That incident was almost discovered, but she managed to keep it under wraps.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana suspected her involvement but lacked evidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While Diana had a recording, Gale didn't believe her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank whispered to comfort her, "Queenie, don't worry about me. I'm not as naive as Gale."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie smiled. He was even naiver and believed her unconditionally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was determined to help Gale be the heir to the Marsh family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unexpectedly, while dining with Elsie at a restaurant, Frank ran into Diana and Paige, who were having dinner together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige, clad in a black suit, sat beside Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was very surprised upon seeing Paige. "Paige, it's been months. You're like a whole new person."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gone was her youthful look; her hair was now cropped short, and she appeared slimmer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had delicate features and exquisite makeup. If Diana bumped into her on the street, she might not recognize her at first glance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A year of business experience had sharpened Paige's gaze, lending her an air of resolve. She carried herself with a pride that was confident but not boastful, her overall demeanor exuding an unexpected charm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige smiled faintly. "Diana, you've changed too. Stay away from jerks, and we could both live well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana had changed. Her newfound strength and composure were seemingly rooted deep within her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Frank and Elsie entered, they saw Diana and Paige engaged in a lively conversation.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="283.html">« Prev</a><a href="285.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
