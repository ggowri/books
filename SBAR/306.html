I'm already under too much pressure. I'm frustrated too; I feel like screaming."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracey was startled by her son's agony, and her tears suddenly stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jeff, what's happened to you? You've aged ten years in just a few days. Is something wrong with your health?" she asked, concerned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracey finally noticed something was off with Jeff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She remembered him as charming, even into middle age, but now he looked completely worn out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff knew well that his recent illness had indeed aged him significantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He sighed helplessly. "Mom, I'm really troubled. The doctor said I might have early-onset Alzheimer's. How could I get such a disease at my age?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't understand why it was him falling ill instead of Paula.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula had once said the herbal medicine was too bitter to swallow, so she chose to stop taking it. Now, she was as healthy as ever, while he struggled with illness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is this&hellip; truly karma?" he wondered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The news hit Tracey like a sledgehammer. "What? Alzheimer's? I'm still sharp as ever. How could you have this disease?" she exclaimed, hurriedly grabbing her phone to call Paula.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she looked up, she was surprised to see Paula standing not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Furious, Tracey stormed over and scolded, "Paula, as a wife, my son is sick, and you're always running off. As a woman, you should be at home, supporting your husband and raising your children. Are you trying to kill my son?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula responded calmly, her face showing helplessness. "Mom, listen to me. Before I came back, I picked up Jeff's medical report. It only showed high cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar. If he watches his diet and exercises, there won't be major health issues. As for Alzheimer's, the doctor only mentioned it as a risk, not a diagnosis.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry. Jeff's company has had some issues lately; you know his nature. He tends to avoid problems. I need to go out and address real issues to ensure our family's well-being.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If he keeps avoiding the company's issues, and I don't step up, are we all supposed to starve?" Paula's words left Tracey momentarily stunned. She hadn't expected such honesty from her daughter-in-law.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula's words left Tracey so taken aback that she temporarily forgot her previous anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew that no one understood her son better than she did. Over the years, he had indeed grown dependent under Paula's care, but Paula's resilience and independence had brought a sense of hope to the family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Silently, Tracey nodded, acknowledging Paula's words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You can't just disappear for days. Ever since I came here, you haven't shown up. Are you not welcoming me?" Tracey questioned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula feigned sadness. "Mom, I've been swamped with company matters. Jeff is ill, Gale's in trouble, and Frank is rebelling, wanting to marry that terrible woman. I'm already overwhelmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I stay home to take care of you, who will earn the money? The company is deep in debt, and we've lost several partnerships. If this continues, we won't even have scraps to eat."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her plan was steadily moving forward.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="305.html">« Prev</a><a href="307.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
