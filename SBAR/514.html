"Okay! You are my savior. I will give you this favor. If you want that land, take it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was surprised that Steven agreed so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "He deliberately mentions I am his savior, telling me that he helps me because I saved his life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Another possibility is that Steven still dotes on me. But he doesn't want me to be labeled as a mistress, so he keeps his distance from me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smiled gently, her eyes slightly red with gratitude. "Steven, thank you. I want to be strong and be able to stand with you, so that no one will say anything about us anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Diana, that loser, can't be worthy of Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I will not give Diana anything, including the things I don't want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven smiled meaningfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took Evan to his seat and sat down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric was there, too. He sat next to Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said with a smile, "Mr. Gellar, I'm happy to see you here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned slightly and felt a little uncomfortable with Eric's unfamiliar attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't seen Eric since that night. Seeing Eric this time, Steven felt he had changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, I heard that you and Diana are getting a divorce. When are you going to get divorced? Queenie likes you so much. Haven't you always wanted to marry Queenie all these years?" asked Eric with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned, and the murderous intent in his eyes was apparent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had said he wanted to marry Queenie, but only if she was the one who saved him in the fire. But Queenie was not.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was the only woman who had saved him in the fire and the car accident, causing him to be unable to stand and become blind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was actually confused. He thought, "Sir Bishop seems to dislike me. But he went to my office that day and told me that it was Diana who saved me from the fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he really wants us to divorce, shouldn't he hide the truth?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Sir Bishop told me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And what does my grandpa know? Why does he insist that I marry Diana?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These two don't seem to know each other."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven answered him coldly, "It is a matter between us. It seems that it is not your turn to interfere."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric sneered, "Steven, do you want to have the best of both worlds? You hold on to Diana and dote on Queenie. Do you really think that the Gellar family can stand firm just because it is the wealthiest family in Capitole?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the fact that Queenie is your mistress gets out, Mr. Gellar, your stock will fall." He sneered, thinking, "The two should get together. My sister is still young and beautiful. She will find someone who loves her more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was really blind before and doted on the wrong person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at Eric coldly, thinking, "He really has changed from before. But his words seems to be calling me a scumbag."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie is your sister. You are not afraid of her being embarrassed. Why should I be afraid?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's smile had a profound meaning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made Eric a little confused about Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Before, Steven was willing to do anything for Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just now, he gave Queenie the land in the western suburbs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why isn't he willing to divorce and marry Queenie?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven had lived in darkness since he was a child. Except for his grandparents, no one loved him. Queenie approached him only because he was the one in charge of the Gellar family.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="513.html">« Prev</a><a href="515.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
