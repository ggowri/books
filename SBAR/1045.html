He knew it was still early, and Queenie usually didn&rsquo;t get up until after ten in the morning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He really had disturbed her sleep. Back then, whenever their family got up, they would speak in hushed tones, afraid of disturbing their most pampered princess.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Life now felt so unfamiliar to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan had no money, no house. It was miserable!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He forced a smile. "Queenie, I'm sorry for bothering you. I need your help</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>F</span><span>inding </span><span>me </span><span>a place. I&rsquo;ve cut ties with </span><span>Paula</span><span>. For you, I&rsquo;m ready to fight them to the end."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie&rsquo;s sleepiness vanished instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What an idiot!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He still doesn&rsquo;t get what I said. Can&rsquo;t he even pretend to go along with it?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You cut ties with her? Dylan, that was so impulsive. </span><span>She</span><span> loves you. If you go along with her, she&rsquo;ll make you a good life."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie cursed Dylan as a useless fool in her heart. Now, she had no choice but to use him to steal business secrets.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only if he felt sorry for her would he do things for her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She held back the urge to scold him and smiled, "Dylan, it&rsquo;s all my fault. I </span><span>made this</span><span>. But </span><span>Paula</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s</span><span> </span><span>kind. Maybe, after some time, she&rsquo;ll come around. Let me find you a place. </span><span>W</span><span>e can explain to her together. She&rsquo;ll forgive us, I&rsquo;m sure."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan thought the same.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gave a faint smile.</span><br><span>"</span><span>Queenie... I wasn&rsquo;t gonna bring this up, but, well, now that I&rsquo;ve been kicked out...</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He scratched the back of his neck.</span><br><span>"</span><span>I don&rsquo;t have a job. No income. Something happened while I was abroad&mdash;during a competition, I hit someone. Gave him everything I had. Then the team dropped me.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He paused, then added quietly,</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>Could you maybe lend me some money? Just for now. I&rsquo;ll pay you back once I start making something again.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Queenie felt even angrier. No wonder he came back right around Christmas. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If her plans</span><span> </span><span>weren&rsquo;t be ruined by Diana, he would&rsquo;ve been left to rot abroad. But he still had his uses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Compared to Paula&rsquo;s billion-dollar inheritance, this was nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dylan, no need for us to be so formal. I&rsquo;ll transfer $100,000 to your account. Use it for now. Once </span><span>Paula</span><span> agrees to take you back, her billion-dollar fortune will all be yours."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie lay on the bed, her eyes cold and filled with venom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula should&rsquo;ve never revealed the truth. It would only make Queenie even more greedy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan chuckled, "Queenie, don&rsquo;t worry. You&rsquo;ll get your share too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie suddenly spoke with concern, "Dylan, I know you care about me, but Diana&rsquo;s always scheming. Steven&rsquo;s Gellar Group was taken by her tricks, and now we&rsquo;re tough. I&rsquo;m afraid Paula might feel guilty and end up getting played by Diana."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana managed </span><span>once</span><span>, definitely capable of going after </span><span>Paula</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s</span><span> </span><span>money too. Everything that happened before, it was all Diana framing me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dylan, I&rsquo;m afraid Diana might frame you too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan's face darkened. A sly grin spread across his lips. "Queenie, don&rsquo;t worry. I won&rsquo;t give her a chance. Now that I&rsquo;m back, I&rsquo;ll protect you. I&rsquo;ll deal with her and get your revenge."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Queenie felt relieved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Dylan, take a cab to the address. From now on, you&rsquo;ll stay in the apartment I used to live in."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the Foliot family caused a scene at her place, she moved to another apartment. She planned to let Dylan stay in her old one.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright. Queenie, you&rsquo;re the best. I&rsquo;ll head over right away."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan hung up the phone and saw the address Queenie had sent him. He realized it was a luxury complex, a hundred times better than the rundown apartments Paula lived in.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He got up happily, washed up, and went downstairs. After grabbing his luggage, he headed straight to Queenie&rsquo;s apartment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Paula, Gale, and Eric had also moved into a luxurious flat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This complex was close to where Diana lived.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula wanted to be closer to Diana, so she could secretly watch her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From the 25th floor, Paula had a clear view of Diana&rsquo;s luxurious villa neighborhood. The morning was misty, but she felt happy. From now on, she would watch over Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In truth, Paula was selfish too. That night, she got drunk.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After finding out she was pregnant, she didn&rsquo;t feel much burden. Young and naive, she hadn&rsquo;t realized back then&mdash;she didn&rsquo;t love Jeff that much.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was merely moved by her own sense of self-righteousness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back then, the Gellar family wanted to marry Diana, so Sir Gellar must know the truth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he&rsquo;s been gone for two years. When he comes back, make sure to get answers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Any</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> secret behind all this?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why did he insist on Steven marrying Diana?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Early this morning, Diana went to the office.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though she hadn&rsquo;t heard anything about Andrew yet, she needed to be ready to handle whatever he might throw her way.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>S</span><span>he had already found a way.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana still had to go to the office in her wheelchair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Nick parked the car, Luna got out, prepared her wheelchair, and pushed her into the office.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they entered the lobby, Dylan suddenly appeared, blocking Diana's way.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing him, she felt annoyed, not understanding why he was here again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna eyed Dylan warily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sneered, "Diana, your people injured me. </span><span>T</span><span>en million dollars in compensation."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The amount he demanded was ridiculously high.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana scoffed, "</span><span>N</span><span>ot worth ten million dollars."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan was infuriated by her scornful remark.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Do I look that cheap?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Right then, Diana's firm voice rang in his ears. "Dylan, you've always been cheap."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan was completely stunned.</span><span> </span><span>Diana actually called him cheap.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He pointed at her angrily. "You... Diana, how dare you call me cheap?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had no intention of arguing with him. She knew he was here to avenge Queenie and demand compensation for his injuries from last night.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Luna, throw him out. Without my permission, he's not allowed to step in here again." She had an important meeting today and no time to argue with him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When she was in a bad mood, she could tear Dylan down until he was utterly defeated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sneered, looking down at her. "Diana, if you dare have me thrown out, I'll call the media and tell everyone how you ruined my family."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at Dylan, utterly speechless. The same old threat again!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She sneer</span><span>ed</span><span>, </span><span>"</span><span>You&rsquo;re not blind, Dylan. You know the truth&mdash;you just blame me because it&rsquo;s easy. If you&rsquo;d do this to your own sister, how much do you really care about Queenie?</span><span>"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1044.html">« Prev</a><a href="1046.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
