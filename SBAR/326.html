Why don't you come with me?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll introduce you to some connections. You're a designer now, right? You must need high-quality fabrics. I can introduce you to some great fabric factory owners. I'm sure you'll love their fabrics. They're all high-end and excellent.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, the people I'll introduce to you are the best. I've always wanted to thank you, but I didn't know how. Now that I know you're a fashion designer, this is the least I can do to repay you."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled, knowing that he was a grateful person.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her previous life, Queenie had used this to manipulate Cecil.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she wasn't Queenie, she indeed needed connections.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The vast difference in status often made her the target of Queenie's ridicule. Queenie would team up with others to insult and look down on her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie enjoyed humiliating her under the guise of kindness and gentleness, while committing the vilest acts.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Behind that beautiful facade, her heart was completely rotten.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled and said, "Cecil, thank you."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil replied, "Diana, I should be the one thanking you. I'll come to pick you up in three days."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled and said, "Alright."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana lay down and went to sleep.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next morning, the butler asked the chef to prepare oatmeal for Diana, along with a steamed grouper.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nothing tasted better than the fruits of her own labor.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was halfway through eating when her phone rang.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She picked it up and saw it was Queenie.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was surprised that Queenie would call her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hello?" Diana answered the phone while continuing to eat.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie sounded arrogant. "Diana, you tried to sabotage me with that live broadcast, hoping I wouldn't get the lead role, but you're going to be disappointed. The lead role is still mine."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana laughed, "Queenie, are you really that proud? You're covered in scandals, and yet you still dare to act?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, you'd better keep your mouth shut. I've told you before, you'll always be a loser compared to me," Queenie laughed arrogantly. She didn't care about the process, only the result.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana wanted to drag her down to hell, but that wasn't possible.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana countered, "Queenie, what are you so proud of? You're just benefiting others while draining Jace's resources. I'll be watching closely."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie narrowed her eyes, "Diana, what do you mean by that?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana replied, "Nothing much. Are you done showing off? If so, I'm going to hang up. I'm having breakfast, and I won't let you ruin my mood."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie ended the call.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana snorted with disdain.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was on her way to have breakfast with Jace. After hanging up the phone, she was frustrated. Diana had grown smarter and wasn't as easy to bully as before.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, her assistant, Mario Gillespie, walked over and got into the car, his face serious. "Miss, Cecil is investigating you. He seems to have found out about the hotel incident."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="325.html">« Prev</a><a href="327.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
