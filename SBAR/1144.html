"Evan, you said nothing would happen, so I didn&rsquo;t go tonight, and now Diana&rsquo;s in trouble."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan was also in despair, but he smiled and said, "Luna, Mr. Gellar and Mrs. Gellar have been married for three years. This time, they can truly be together, and we should be happy. We should thank those bastards."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Many things need the right opportunity. Now it's time for us to exit."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna was speechless and didn&rsquo;t want Diana to have regrets.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go. What's done is done. I just hope Diana won't hate Steven when she wakes up tomorrow morning."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan was also worried about this, but worrying was useless. "Let's go, we'll investigate the truth first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upstairs, Steven carried Diana into the room, locked the door, and only turned on the bedside lamp.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The warm yellow light added an intimate atmosphere.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He placed Diana on the soft, large bed. She was breathing heavily, constantly tugging at her clothes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, I feel so uncomfortable."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven quickly took off his clothes and hers as well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's hair was messy, and her face was flushed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, open your eyes and look at me. Who am I?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's hand wandered over his chest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven gently patted her face and said, "Diana, wake up."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at Steven with a dazed expression. Seeing he wasn't wearing clothes, Diana seemed to realize something.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She remembered that last time she also took an aphrodisiac.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That time, Steven took her to the hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, he didn't.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, what... what are you doing?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's breathing quickened. She was still thinking about not having eaten enough; she only had a piece of cake.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven quietly gazed at her and said softly, "Diana, we are husband and wife. I've wanted to sleep with you for a long time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, I want you to clearly feel my body. I am your husband."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven didn't wait for Diana to speak and lowered his head to kiss her lips.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mm..." Diana felt her whole body yearning for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven already understood this. His movements were very gentle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's whole body trembled, feeling so comfortable!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's hands instinctively wrapped around his waist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her actions made Steven completely let go of his worries.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven could no longer control himself. The moment he entered, Diana let out a painful sound.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stayed still, waiting for her to adjust to him. He felt an unprecedented pleasure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven gently kissed Diana's eyes and softly said, "Diana, I'll be gentler."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shed tears from the pain and said nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a long time, seeing Diana's expression relax, Steven became even bolder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the car, Cecil looked at Olivia in the passenger seat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had already heard about what happened at the banquet. Diana was taken away by Steven, and he felt relieved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana ultimately belonged to Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Cecil was quite happy, he could forgive Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the social engagement, he came to pick up Olivia, wanting to have a late-night snack with her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Olivia kept looking out the window, lost in thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her profile was beautiful, her eyes especially bright, like a night elf.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil could smell a faint rose fragrance. From his angle, she looked stunningly delicate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil smiled gently and said, "Olivia, what are you looking at?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia smiled and said, "Wish them happiness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?" Cecil asked, puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia looked at him and said, "Cecil, Diana came back and changed all of your lives. You can live on now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil knew there was some truth in what she said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was very composed now. With a faint smile, he asked, "Olivia, what about us?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia asked curiously, "What about us?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil smiled and said, "Nothing. What do you want for a late-night snack? I'll take you to eat."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During this time, he kept asking her out for dinner, but she never thought he might have feelings for her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia said, "I want fried chicken tonight."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil smiled and said, "Alright! Let's head out right away."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil drove with a smile, thinking about where to get fried chicken.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Late at night, in the dim room, Alexander stood by the window.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He held a cigarette between his fingers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the darkness, the cigarette's glow flickered, obscuring his expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander still lost Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had been lonely for over twenty years, finally met the woman he loved, yet still lost her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He lost her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander stood all night, his temples streaked with gray.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At noon, under the bright sunlight, Diana slowly opened her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sunlight streamed through the window, and Diana felt its warmth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The weather is getting warmer day by day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt unwell all over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She recalled what happened last night.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She suddenly looked beside her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's handsome face was just inches away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was still nestled in his arms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought, "Why did we cross the line last night?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why did we suddenly sleep together last night?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana frowned and yelled, "Steven."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was startled awake by her angry shout. Seeing her pale face, he was slightly stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Darling, you're awake." His voice was a bit hoarse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana pointed at herself, then at him. Neither of them was wearing clothes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She shyly said, "Steven, you're shameless."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1143.html">« Prev</a><a href="1145.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
