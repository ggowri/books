"Well, Steven, you promised to marry Queenie, then went and married me instead. Guess that makes you a world-class jerk.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's late, I'll leave you two lovebirds alone."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana yanked her hand free and </span><span>left</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she'd barely taken a few steps when Steven grabbed her wrist, his eyes deep with anger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, cut the crap. Where do you think you're going?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana whirled around</span><span>. H</span><span>er face streaked with tears.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, we're divorced. Please keep your distance. Th</span><span>ere</span><span> is Ms. Queenie Marsh, the woman you truly love. I'm just trying to get out of your way so you </span><span>two </span><span>can be together. Is that wrong?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stared at the tears on her face. She was clearly crying, yet something felt off.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He yanked her back, growling, "Get back inside and wait for me, will you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wait for what? Who wants to wait around for a scumbag with another woman on his mind?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana jerked her arm free from Steven's grip with all her might.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She took off running. When she'd gone upstairs earlier to change, she'd swapped her shoes for a pair she could sprint in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Damn that mustard! The spicy fumes were getting to her head, making her feel awful.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, get back here!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven moved to chase after her, but Queenie quickly latched onto him, demanding through tears, "Steven, why are you doing this to me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven snapped back to reality, his handsome face dark with anger as he coldly stared her down. "Queenie, what the hell are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie froze, taken aback by the ice in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She frowned slightly. "I came to find you. You've been ignoring my calls all day and refusing to talk to me. I got scared... scared you didn't love me anymore."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I never loved you in the first place."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His tone was cold and indifferent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was stunned. She'd spent her whole life trying to get close to Steven, and he'd always been so good to her. She could have anything she wanted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now he was saying he didn't love her!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So</span><span>,</span><span> Diana is the one he loved?" she thought.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, do you really have to treat me like this? I've loved you for my entire youth."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven let out a sneer. "And you actually believed all that puppy love nonsense? How naively ridiculous.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, if it weren't for what you've pulled recently, I might have kept being nice to you. But your attempts to frame Diana have really pissed me off.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You deliberately set up </span><span>a</span><span> kidnapping to frame Diana, all to try and make me divorce her, right?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Did you think I wouldn't see through that little stunt? I just let it slide to see how far you'd go in hurting Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But you've gone too far. I'm taking back every ounce of kindness I ever showed you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Steven turned and went into the villa, locking the door behind him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie stood in the night breeze, her thoughts in turmoil.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven clearly didn't trust her anymore. Damn that, Diana! She'd spent her whole youth trying to win Steven over.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How the hell had Diana managed to get evidence?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No, I can't lose! I absolutely can't lose to Diana!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She still had so much left unfinished. She refused to lose, no matter what.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, you bitch!" Queenie snarled as she stormed off.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stood upstairs, his gaze growing darker and </span><span>fiercer</span><span> as he watched Queenie leave. He picked up his phone and called Evan.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Gellar," Evan answered.</span><span> He was sleeping and woke up by the call.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's tone was displeased. "Have you found out why Queenie left back then?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Evan snapped awake instantly. Startled by Steven's icy voice, he stammered,</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, I've looked into it. It was two years ago, but I've uncovered some leads.
