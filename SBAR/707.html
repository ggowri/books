This evidence is very helpful for my divorce case and can help me get a large share of the assets. Since you're bringing money to me, I should thank you properly."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How...! Shameless!" Queenie shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana continued, "You call me shameless? Why didn't you call yourself shameless when you were framing me? You should have known that I'm not someone to be trifled with. I tolerated you for so long because of the ungrateful Marsh family.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eric has had a high fever for three days without any of you caring. In fact, it wasn't really a high fever; he was poisoned. Queenie, how he was poisoned is something you know better than anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You personally poisoned him, causing him to have a high fever for three days. Then you put on an act of being a caring sister to your brother, but Eric was too foolish to see through your scheme.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm very curious why haven't you killed him yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was stunned and couldn't believe it. On the other end of the call, where Diana couldn't see her, her face twisted in a grimace. "Diana, how do you know about all this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She even knew about the trigger of Eric's illness.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's very simple. You act carelessly because you think everyone will side with you and believe you. It's this confidence that has always made you slip up."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This way, I can finally get a hold of the Marsh family's scumbags. Thank you for helping me deal with that old bastard Jeff. He was utterly disgusting, and now you've made him look like trash. I'm really grateful to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hung up the phone with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that how revenge feels? It's so good!" Diana was super happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?" Then, she heard a gloomy voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Startled, Diana's laughter abruptly stopped. She lifted her gaze to look at Steven, thinking, "Is this guy sick? How can he walk without making any sound?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She laughed arrogantly. "Who wouldn't be happy after getting revenge? But I'll be even happier once you're dead. I can go on dates with eight handsome guys all at the same time."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was way too happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's face darkened; he would absolutely not let her wish to date handsome men come true. "Do you really hope I die that much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Yes, do you remember what I said to you at the beginning? I came back alive just to watch you and Queenie kill each other. I want revenge. My head is still replaying everything you did to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's good mood was ruined by Steven, so she sat down and said sullenly, "Let's have dinner."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven sat across from her, looking at her, the hatred on her face was intense. She truly wished for him and Queenie to both die.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana ignored his gaze and just buried her head into the food.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana like this made him feel quite powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of love turned to hate, she actually wanted to watch him die.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana took a bite of her favorite shrimp balls and felt satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her phone rang again, she glanced down and quickly picked it up. "Hello, Joseph."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, did you have dinner?" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana blinked, feeling that this child really cared about her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Joseph, I'm eating. What about you?" Diana asked with a smile.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="706.html">« Prev</a><a href="708.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
