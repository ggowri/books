"Diana, I see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he handed her a cup of hot chocolate. "Diana, it's warm, your favorite."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She beamed with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven noticed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's heartfelt smile made everything pale in comparison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lowered her head to take a sip of hot chocolate and grinned with satisfaction.

There was a world of distance between them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, when QM Company was read out on the stage, Diana glanced up at the models on the stage. Their clothes looked familiar. She instantly flew into a rage and glared at Queenie, who was next to Nolan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie smiled provocatively at her.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="843.html">« Prev</a><a href="845.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
