He said in surprise, "Mr. Gellar, Mrs. Gellar looks so beautiful holding the child."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's beauty was stunning, especially when she smiled from the side with her head slightly tilted up.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Evan showing an admiring face, Steven smiled and reminded him, "That's my wife. Ask the bodyguards to follow them and see what they are doing here."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan teased him, "Mr. Gellar, you finally care about Mrs. Gellar. You know? You haven't asked about Ms. Marsh once in the past few days, and I'm not used to it. If it was before, you would ask me to see where Ms. Marsh is, ask her assistant if she has eaten well today, or what clothes she is wearing, and whether she is cold. You cared about her so much, but now you haven't asked about these things for three days.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, you are skilled at loving someone," Evan said while sending messages.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven suddenly stopped and glanced at Evan coldly. "Evan, if you don't speak, no one will think you are dumb."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was helpless. He sighed heavily, "Mr. Gellar, I was complimenting you. You are so skilled at loving someone, but why did you say you don't know how to love someone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was furious. He glanced at Evan with a cold look. "I told you not to argue with me, but you argue every day, don't you? You say you are not a nitpicker?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan smiled embarrassedly and scratched his head. "Mr. Gellar, I can't stand what you did. You mistook the person and ended up being a bastard..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out!" Steven was angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He already knew that he had recognized the wrong person, and the person who saved him was Diana, not Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had realized his mistake and was already correcting it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan smiled and followed Steven up. After entering the elevator, he said, "Mr. Gellar, it's too late to care about Mrs. Gellar now. Luna said that Mrs. Gellar might go abroad and never come back."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was slightly stunned. Thinking of Diana's attitude and the disgust in her eyes, which was also the way he used to look at her, he felt very uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have a good relationship with Luna?" Steven said in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan smiled somewhat unnaturally, "Mr. Gellar, Luna is important to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven understood that Evan had fallen in love with Luna.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought for a while and said, "I'll give you a raise this month. You should work harder and pursue Luna."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was great. He could have a relationship and get a raise. Luna was his lucky star.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan quickly sent a message to Luna.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Luna, thank you.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna replied to him: [What's wrong with you?]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan smiled foolishly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He got a pay raise.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Evan received the news. "Mr. Gellar. Mrs. Gellar and her friends have booked two presidential suites upstairs for three days."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven asked, "Why do they want to stay in a hotel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan shook his head. "I don't know."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven said, "Ask the bodyguards to continue to follow them."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan said, "Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could tell that Steven cared more and more about Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a good thing. In Evan's eyes, Diana was a good person.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, I don't quite understand why Mrs. Gellar forgave Queenie. Queenie disappeared for three days and went to the island for surgery. She was really pregnant. Why didn't Mrs. Gellar expose her and instead let her on the trending?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Evan checked his phone just now, he saw that Queenie was on the trending again, and her popularity was increasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked calm, but his tone was cold. "The taller she grows, the harder she will fall."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was stunned.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="762.html">« Prev</a><a href="764.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
