But from Queenie's perspective, Penelope is Queenie's friend. To be honest, I won't marry a woman like her. She's very open-minded, smoking, drinking, fighting, and having sex in groups! I saw all of this with my own eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Because we have a project and have to go to the bar often to discuss it. That young master likes the atmosphere of the bar. I met him a few times when I went there, but I didn't greet him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In his eyes, Penelope was a bad girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was not a good choice for marriage. He still preferred someone like Diana, who could both be elegant and do housework.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Gale likes her, so we can't say anything. Penelope has a bad reputation in the circle, and Althea also likes Gale, so their relationship is complicated."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"And I heard that Penelope is pregnant. Gale is preparing to marry Penelope after the competition."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Taking advantage of this opportunity, Evan continued, "Mr. Gellar, except for you and the Marsh family, outsiders including me have a very good opinion of Ms. Bishop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Edward Gellar and Mrs. Helen Gellar both like her very much. Even the lady you sent to the mental hospital likes her very much. Only when you are well, I will be well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana was good to Mr. Edward Gellar and Mrs. Helen Gellar. She was always by your side back then. You were blind and very irritable, but Diana always took care of you patiently, and you gradually got better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Gellar, I think you should try to trust Ms. Bishop a little more. She is pitiful. The Marsh family simply doesn't treat her as a human being."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's eyes were naturally cold and calm, but he lost control when facing Gale just now. It could be seen that he was gradually trusting Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana likes you so much that she even tattooed your name on her chest with an elegant jasmine flower on it. She likes jasmine flowers."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven glanced at him coldly, as if he wanted to dig out his eyes. "When have you seen it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Ah... it was the last time I went to the island. On the night when Gale got into trouble, I met Ms. Bishop and Althea on the road when they went swimming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I saw the tattoo on Ms. Bishop's chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I also heard their conversation. Althea said that you loved Queenie wholeheartedly and asked why Diana tattooed your name on her chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I remember Ms. Bishop answered that if she tattooed the name of her loved one on her chest, she would feel closer to that person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Althea scolded her for being too humble. At that time, you were accompanying Ms. Marsh because she accidentally scraped her hand while swimming during the day. If you were a few minutes late, her wound would have healed itself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana tattooed his name on her chest, how could he not know?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan observed Steven's expression and saw that his eyes were getting colder and colder and he looked angry. Evan wisely shut up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm going to call Ms. Bishop and ask about the situation half a year ago."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan turned and left, standing in the corner and calling Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana still showed Evan respect because he had been nice to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana answered his call with a good temper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When the call was connected, he was very grateful and said, "Ms. Bishop, thank you for answering my call. Gale treated you like this because of something that happened half a year ago. I want to check what happened back then and resolve this misunderstanding. Ms. Bishop, can you give me some clues?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana didn't understand why Steven wanted to investigate what happened half a year ago. "Why? Did Mr. Gellar be uneasy when he heard that it was Queenie and Penelope who schemed against Gale? Does he want to find out the truth and clear Queenie's name?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Diana heard Evan's words, her first reaction was that Steven was going to hold justice for Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This happened many times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan was helpless. In Diana's eyes, Steven was the worst scumbag.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana continued, "Evan, tell Steven, I have evidence about what happened half a year ago. When the time comes, I will take it out myself and let him think of a plan to save his girlfriend."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="122.html">« Prev</a><a href="124.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
