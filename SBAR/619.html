Nothing is interesting. On leaving Marsh Villa, I kindly reminded Paula. Later, she found out something and plotted against Jeff. We can just watch them fight each other.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna replied: [Okay, Diana, but you shouldn't have reminded them. They are vicious and disgusting. Why bother?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furious, Luna put down her phone and drove away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie limped back to the second floor and saw Jeff lying on the sofa, scrolling through his mobile phone. The thought of Paula seeing her in her most miserable condition upset her a lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She walked over and was about to lose her temper when he suddenly said, "Prepare lunch. I'm hungry. Don't cook greasy food. I can't eat it now. Make me something light."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt more and more uncomfortable and dared not eat fatty food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was stunned. His words annoyed her. She stared at him and sneered, "Jeff, I married you to enjoy life, not to serve you. I have lived in secret for so many years. Do you wish me to serve you now? It's impossible. I'll order takeout for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Takeout?" Jeff frowned. He sat up from the sofa and glared at her. "Amelie, how could you let me eat takeout? If it were Paula, she would do that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie snorted, gazing at him with hatred, "Jeff, when you beat me just now, Paula was watching outside. You have embarrassed and humiliated me. Do you still want me to cook for you? Dream on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She treated you very well, but you are divorced now, and she has nothing to do with you anymore. She is eager to kill you. How dare you expect her to prepare lunch for you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jeff, are you still daydreaming?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mocking voice irritated him. Suddenly, he froze. "Did you mention Paula was watching us outside the villa just now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! So, if you want to eat lunch, go to hell." With that, Amelie went back to her room with a dark face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Jeff was very excited, wondering if Paula still cared about him and was worried that he was not eating well or sleeping well in the winter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always been very considerate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff quickly approached the window and glanced out, only to find that there was no one outside. Disappointed, he went to the kitchen.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sink was full of dishes and cutlery that had not been washed yesterday. Jeff did not know where to start despite attempting to make himself some food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been pampered by Paula for more than twenty years and couldn't cook at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, she didn't allow him to cook. There were always servants and chefs at home, so he could eat whatever he wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Jeff couldn't even have a warm meal. His increasing anger led him to quarrel with Amelie again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the divorce, instead of living the life he wanted, he lived in chaos every day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelie, come out and make lunch for me. I'm hungry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost! I am not your servant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the afternoon, Diana reviewed all the documents. The high-intensity work did not have much impact on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her health gave her time to do everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned off the computer and stretched herself. After saying she was fine in her family group chat, she went home.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once in the car, Diana took a look at the family group chat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobias, Julius, and Leopold replied to her message, but Hubery still ignored her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was very sad that Hubery remained unwilling to forgive her.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="618.html">« Prev</a><a href="620.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
