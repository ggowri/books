She's just a wild girl from the countryside, yet you truly treat her as your treasure. Aren't you afraid of disgracing your family?" she said with a mocking smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it weren't for Diana's intentional sabotage, the person handling her affairs now would be Cecil.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil was a very capable person; it was unexpected that he was tamed by Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If the Farley family stood by her side, she wouldn't be facing such a difficult choice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, Jace helped her solve the funding problem.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Otherwise, her company's capital chain would have been broken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, after losing the Farley family's help, she immediately attained Jace's support.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now that she had no worries and had found an excellent tech team, she would definitely take over the Farley family one day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil looked at Diana and said gently, "Thank you for your kind words. If I can win Diana's heart, I will definitely invite you to our wedding."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was taken aback and stamped her foot in anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought, "What's so great about Diana that Cecil actually wants to pursue her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie glared fiercely at Diana and then entered the elevator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana gave her a faint smile and said, "Queenie, regarding last night's incident, I didn't agree to a reconciliation. I think they might cause you trouble after they get out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was taken aback, glared at her fiercely, and ultimately said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige only breathed a sigh of relief when she saw the elevator doors close; she was really afraid of Queenie's tactics.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was extremely adept at manipulating the hearts of important people, and oddly enough, those people fell for her tactics.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh! Diana, I get scared every time I see Queenie; that woman's tactics are endless," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked at her pale face, patted her on the shoulder, and said, "Don't be afraid, Paige, I'm here for you. Come on, let's go fishing. Let's relax one more day before winter really sets in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked out at the clear sky through the window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Winter was coming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">More importantly, what happens next will be even more exciting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's beautiful eyes held a smile, but they seemed somewhat hollow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil looked over, feeling that her hollow gaze carried the weight of past and present lives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His heart suddenly throbbed, and for no apparent reason, his limbs ached.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, the elevator is here, let's go," Paige said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana came back to her senses and entered the elevator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil, however, felt somewhat sad, with a deep ache in his heart. This feeling made him very uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil took a deep breath to ease the discomfort in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana noticed that his expression was off and asked teasingly with a smile, "Cecil, are you also afraid of Queenie?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil responded with an ugly smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, I don't know what happened, but just now, for a moment, I felt pain in all my limbs and my heart was aching," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was taken aback. Calculating the time, after the Farley family was wiped out a few months later, Queenie cut off his limbs, giving Cecil no chance to survive. Queenie also knew that if Cecil had any chance of turning the tables, she would definitely have no way out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked at his pale face and said with a smile, "Don't worry, you'll be fine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In this life, the one who would suffer this pain would be Jace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil smiled and said, "Okay! With you, I'm not afraid."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana, seeing the sincerity in his smile, didn't say anything more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon reaching the first floor, Cecil led them to the dock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked at the clear weather and smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The weather is nice today, and tonight, I'll treat you to the most delicious seafood dinner," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil also set aside the discomfort in his heart, and as he looked at the azure sea, his mood became more pleasant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige said, "Then what are we waiting for? Let's get going."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled, holding the fishing gear in his hand, and said with a smile, "Let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon arriving at the dock and seeing a cruise ship, Diana was stunned. "Cecil, we were supposed to go camping. Are you planning on taking a vacation?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="402.html">« Prev</a><a href="404.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
