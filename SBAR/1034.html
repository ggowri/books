He bent down, picked it up, and looked at her with concern. "Queenie, what's wrong? You look terrible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "What did she see?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie snapped back to reality when she heard his voice. Panic flashed across her face as she looked at George as if seeing the all-powerful Steven. "George, Diana has proof that I killed that girl. What should I do?" She didn't know why Diana could have the proof.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" George asked, completely confused. "What evidence of murder? Aren't you always having other people do your dirty work? Why would you get your hands </span><span>dirty?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, Queenie had always used others to commit her crimes. She never got directly involved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie grabbed her phone. On the screen were videos and messages Diana had sent her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana: [Queenie, remember Callie Hayes? You killed her to win that piano competition and drove her to suicide.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Below is a video showing Queenie and three thugs threatening Callie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie quickly dialed Diana's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Diana was lying on her soft bed, dressed in pink pajamas. Her long hair flowed around her shoulders, and her flawless beauty had an innocent vibe. When she saw Queenie's call, her eyes glinted with coldness. "Hello?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's voice trembled with fury. "Diana, what do you want from me? How do you have these videos?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana listened to the sharp anger in her voice, her tone cold and detached. "Queenie, I wish I didn't have these videos. I hope that girl is still alive, still chasing her dreams, still playing the piano she loved, still honoring her parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you know her piano playing was better than yours. You drove her to her death. She jumped from a building and died horribly. Her mother fell into depression because of it. Her father and brother had to work themselves to the bone to keep the family afloat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, you're truly vile. One day, Callie's name will be cleared, and you will pay for what you've done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furious, Queenie shouted, "Diana, this isn't my fault! She couldn't handle the pressure. What does that have to do with me? She chose to kill herself, not me! What do you expect me to do about it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn't believe how shameless and wicked Queenie was. There was no one in this world as ruthless as her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, I'm not the only one who knows about you threatening Callie with those thugs. Someone in your live stream knows too, and they'll post it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's anger flared at her words. A cold, malicious gleam flickered in her eyes. "Diana, just wait."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She ended the call, a wave of murderous intent crossing her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn't be allowed to live. Queenie's mind immediately flashed back to the two men who had cornered her. That night, she had been surrounded by them, but she couldn't remember their faces anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to George, her gaze hard and resolute. "George, Diana can't stay alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George blinked, taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie didn't have time for his shock. She quickly had her own livestream shut down and set up a new broadcast under the company's account, keeping the money flowing as usual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Diana told Queenie about this, Diana wouldn't take this matter public or let the Hayes family find out. Diana was too kind for her own good&mdash;she knew the Hayes family couldn't stand up to Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had just started clearing her name, and any new scandal would cause a backlash against her company's products. All her efforts would be for nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She needed Diana gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The killing intent in Queenie's eyes was so chilling that even George felt a shiver down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana put down her phone. This time, she was setting a trap. She refused to believe that Queenie's hidden assassins would stay idle. She had to draw them out&mdash;she couldn't let her family be in danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana lay down, closing her eyes, but sleep didn't come easily. Her mind kept replaying the events from her past life. In that life, she never met Lillian. But in this one, Lillian's appearance had to mean something&mdash;it could uncover more secrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the weight of her thoughts, Diana managed to fall asleep. She knew she needed rest to be at her best for work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Steven sat in his apartment, watching the security footage of Diana returning to his villa. He smiled to himself. He wondered if she was still thinking about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had just showered and was lounging on his bed, the blanket pulled to his waist. His sharp features were softened by a subtle smile. He wore a light gray bathrobe, the collar slightly open, revealing the defined muscles of his abdomen&mdash;his body lean and strong, exuding a certain allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at a photo frame beside him. It was a picture he'd secretly taken of him and Diana. In the photo, Diana was asleep, curled up next to him as he held her, her peaceful expression standing in stark contrast to the chaos around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven reached for the photo frame, gently tracing his finger over her face. "Goodnight, my love."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled softly, placed the frame back, and lay down to sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night passed without a dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana woke up to find it was snowing again outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sighed in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh, I finally get to see the sun, and now it's snowing again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There came a knock at the door. Diana looked toward the door, still half-asleep, her eyes heavy. "Come in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was soft, her expression gentle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna asked, "Diana, it's snowing and cold outside. Do you still want to go to the office today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "No need. I'll work from home. Tell Nick and the others to step up the security. Last night, I told Queenie about Callie. I now have the biggest leverage over her. This video will ruin her again, and she won't let it go. She'll either try to kill me or get the video back. Either way, she never gets her hands dirty&mdash;she'll send her hidden assassins after me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's been backed into a corner now. Her underground network is starting to unravel. We have to be extra careful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna nodded. "Got it! Diana, I made breakfast. When you're ready, come downstairs </span><span>and eat. I'll have Nick and the others come over too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana lazily responded, "Okay, I'll be down in a minute."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Luna left, Diana picked up her phone and glanced at the news. Queenie's latest "accomplishments" were still trending at number one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Ugh, the attention she's getting&mdash;she's really soaking it all in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Lillian, Diana decided to wait. Queenie wasn't stupid enough to rescue Lillian herself; it would be someone else who would try to get her out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sent Cecil a message: [Cecil, keep an eye on Lillian. Find out who's going to try and pull her out.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Queenie saw that Cecil hadn't responded for a while, she knew he was still asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She put down her phone, got out of bed, and started changing. After getting dressed, she went to freshen up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she finished, she grabbed a pink puffer jacket from her closet, took her phone, and went downstairs for breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she entered the dining room, she received a message from Cecil: [Diana, I just woke up. I've had people watching Queenie. Diana, can I come see you today?]</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1033.html">« Prev</a><a href="1035.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
