Whatever you buy her is your business. But lingerie? Take it back and let her wear it for you instead. Keep her busy for three days straight if you want. Just make sure she stays out of my sight.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her anger was unmistakable.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven&#x27;s brow furrowed as he read the messages, realizing for the first time that Queenie had been sending these messages to provoke Diana.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He handed the phone back to her. &quot;I never bought her any clothes. She&#x27;s doing this just to stir up trouble.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana let out a cold laugh. &quot;Oh, she&#x27;s certainly shameless, right up your alley. Now get out.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Standing, she moved to push him toward the door.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Out. I don&#x27;t want to see you. Do whatever you want, go as crazy as you like. Just don&#x27;t drag me into it.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven could see her anger clearly. He felt cornered, yet frustrated.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Out!&quot; she repeated. She was so tired of this endless entanglement with Steven.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Suddenly, he stood up, grasping her shoulders tightly. His voice was low and intense. &quot;Diana, calm down. You&#x27;re overthinking it. It&#x27;s not what you think. I haven&#x27;t bought her anything. I&#x27;ve been here the whole time. She&#x27;s trying to provoke you. Don&#x27;t you see that?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Realizing he might be right, Diana smirked to herself. If Queenie wanted to play games, she could play too.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Picking up her phone, she selected a picture and sent it to Queenie.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was a photo of Queenie in bed with Jace.</p><p style="text-align:left;">[Queenie, send me one more piece of nonsense, and I&#x27;ll make this photo public. Let&#x27;s see what people think of your taste in... variety.]</p><p style="text-align:left;">She showed the message to Steven with a smirk. &quot;Take a look. And remember to stay out of my way. Honestly, both of you are revolting.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven gritted his teeth. &quot;You...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She shrugged off his hands, pointing at the door. &quot;Get out.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her voice was like ice, leaving no room for argument.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He looked at her, frustration in his eyes. &quot;Why can&#x27;t you believe me, just this once? I&#x27;m telling you, Queenie is trying to drive a wedge between us, and you&#x27;re letting her win!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana looked back at him, her eyes welling up. &quot;You think I want to believe her? But the proof is staring me in the face!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven took a deep breath, visibly struggling with the situation.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He didn&#x27;t know how to make her believe him. All he felt was growing anger at Queenie&#x27;s scheming.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana took a shaky breath and muttered to herself, &quot;Alright, alright. Don&#x27;t let it get to you.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She turned and went into the room across the hall, firmly closing the door behind her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She went straight to bed, drained, telling herself that a night&#x27;s sleep would make everything better.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She changed, lay down, and finally closed her eyes, feeling the exhaustion catch up with her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Outside, Steven stood there, staring at her closed door. Anger simmered in his gaze.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Pulling out his phone, he dialed Evan.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mr. Gellar,&quot; Evan answered.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven&#x27;s voice was cold and laced with fury. &quot;Remember that investigation we did on Queenie&#x27;s branch company? Report their finances.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I want that place under so much pressure that every penny she&#x27;s taken from me gets bled back out.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Evan was momentarily stunned, not quite processing what he&#x27;d just heard.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven snapped, &quot;Did you hear me?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">A grin crept across Evan&#x27;s face as he broke into a chuckle. &quot;Oh, I heard you, Mr. Gellar. This is fantastic news. I&#x27;ll get right on it!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">After ending the call, Steven dialed the kitchen to request dinner preparations, even arranging for a special meal for Althea and Paige.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He sat down on the sofa, papers in hand, trying to focus.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie had just returned home, still fuming over Steven&#x27;s indifference. In a fit of frustration, she had sent those messages to Diana, hoping to get a rise out of her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But the incriminating photo of her with Jace left her in a cold sweat.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Damn! How on earth does she have these photos?&quot; she muttered, panicked.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="799.html">« Prev</a><a href="801.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
