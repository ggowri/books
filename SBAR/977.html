Like I said, you'll meet someone who loves you deeply and has adorable children. But as for my own fate, I can't see it. I don't know if I'll ever find someone. You know how it is. My family could never be whole unless my lover gives me the home I've never had. Still, I doubt anyone would truly care for me.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana replied: [You told me before that you can read others' destinies but not your own. But Olivia, you've done so much good in your life. I believe good things will come to you in return.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Olivia said: [I hope so. Right now, my priority is earning money. I want to make my scumbag father regret everything he did.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana inhaled deeply. Olivia's family was a mess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her father had been heartless toward her, which explained why she worked tirelessly to make money. For Olivia, financial security was safety.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana understood that well. Money meant security to her too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana said: [Let's make a fortune together. We'll look out for each other and live good lives.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Olivia agreed: [Deal! I'll be back on the 8th of January. Don't worry about my grandparents. They're happy and healthy here. Their future looks bright.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana replied: [That's good. At least they won't be threatened anymore.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Olivia said: [Exactly! Take care of yourself. I can't interfere with your plans, but if you need help, just call me. You've been in some danger lately. Please stay cautious."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[I will!] Diana assured her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Olivia typed: [Good night, Diana!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana answered: [Good night!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana set her phone down and closed her eyes to rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tomorrow was January 3rd, a day she could finally spend quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet Olivia's warning lingered in her mind. She smiled faintly, knowing her friend had understated it. Her life wasn't just dangerous. It was outright perilous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's retaliation would hit her like a storm. Even so, Diana managed to fall asleep quickly. She had always been a good sleeper. If she wanted to rest, she could fall asleep in seconds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the hospital, the vile stench from Queenie and George attracted the doctors. After an examination, they were diagnosed with bacterial intestinal infections.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The bacteria had entered their systems through their food, causing relentless vomiting and diarrhea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By the time the ordeal ended, it was the middle of the night. Both of them lay weak and bedridden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's face was pale, her eyes void of energy. "Ahhh," she groaned in despair. She felt like death was near.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was so weak she couldn't even sit up, and her anger and pain were overwhelming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was the worst day of her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Never in her life had she been so humiliated. She'd always been the pampered princess of her family. But the events of this day had made her wish for death. The disdainful looks from the doctors and nurses pierced her pride. She almost wanted to gouge out their eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wanted to erase their memories, to make them forget everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She fumed inwardly, "Who dared to target us like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was certain someone had poisoned their food. But when she checked the surveillance footage, it showed nothing but static. This could only mean that someone had entered their room, tampered with their food, and then erased the evidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her mind raced. "When did they strike?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, she remembered the janitor. The person had been dressed in hospital scrubs, his face obscured by a mask, his head bowed. All she'd seen were his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who was it? Who poisoned us with such a vile substance?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie turned to look at George. His eyes were empty, fixed on the ceiling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was furious but silent. As a man, today's events had shattered his dignity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the doctors and nurses left, George lay motionless on the bed. He hadn't uttered a word since.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"George, are you okay?" she asked softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Shut up," he snapped, his voice icy. "Don't talk to me. I don't want to hear anyone right now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All he wanted was silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today had been a living hell for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His reputation was in ruins.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie felt a pang of sadness but didn't push further. She wanted answers. She wanted to know who had orchestrated this humiliation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She weakly slapped the bed in frustration, her body too drained to exert any real force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It was Diana," she muttered. "She must have realized we were behind tonight's attack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's why she retaliated by poisoning us. She knows medicine. It must have been her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">George's eyes burned with rage as he chuckled coldly. "And what if it was her? What difference does it make? What can you do about it? She's fine, and we're the ones who are suffering. She humiliated us, and we have no proof.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She's mimicking your tactics, using minor tricks to trap us. Even if she were caught, nothing serious would happen to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"With her status and connections, she'd suppress the news in no time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was why George had fought so hard to steal Steven's position.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet now, everything he'd worked for had been destroyed by Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everything he had, Diana had ruined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">George closed his eyes, his body trembling with fury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On January 8th, Diana woke up early, waiting for a call from Jenny.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But by nine o'clock, a message came instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It read: [Sorry, Diana. Something's come up, and I can't meet you today.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana stared at the screen, stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought, "What happened?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">We agreed to meet today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I've been dying to learn the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She replied: [Mrs. Gellar, if there's anything I can do to help, please let me know.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jenny responded: [I'll contact you in a couple of days.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana sighed. She knew there was nothing she could do about that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She sent back: [Alright, Mrs. Gellar.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She asked Luna to get ready. They'd head to the office today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna was already prepared. She brought the wheelchair over, helped Diana sit, and pushed her out the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nick had the car waiting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once Diana was settled, Nick drove them to the company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">January 8th marked the end of the snowy season, though the cold still lingered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In Capitole, snow rarely fell after Christmas, but spring warmth was still a ways off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana gazed out the window. The streets were nearly empty of people and cars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The festive aura of Christmas still hung faintly in the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought to herself, "In two months, it'll be my birthday. Will Hubery be back by then?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="976.html">« Prev</a><a href="978.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
