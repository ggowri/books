She hadn't seen him for half a month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked thinner now, his facial features sharper, and his complexion wasn't good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, his expression was so dark it seemed like a storm was brewing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, what do you think you're doing?" Diana asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was also visibly upset. He had no idea why Steven was here again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven glanced at the USB drive in his hand and then looked at Alexander, his tone dripping with arrogance. "Mr. Powell, I'll review my wife's project myself, so there's no need for you to trouble yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander raised an eyebrow, his gaze darkening. "Mr. Gellar, Diana and I are discussing a potential collaboration. Hand the USB drive back to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's grip on the USB tightened slightly. Diana kept surprising him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected that she was not only a top-notch designer but also someone who had developed an advanced AI medical system.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "Just how many more secrets does she have?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lately, he had also been looking for people to develop a similar project. Since his wife could do it, there was no need for him to go through the trouble of finding others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apologies, Mr. Powell, but tonight's dinner is on me. I'm taking my wife with me. We have things to discuss."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He made a point to emphasize his relationship with Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, he grabbed Diana's hand, intending to lead her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook his hand off with force, glaring at Steven's domineering face. She yelled, "Steven, let me go. I'm not going anywhere with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Alexander shot to his feet and said to Steven, "Steven, let Diana go. She doesn't want to leave with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eyes were icy cold. "Mr. Powell, this is a matter between my wife and me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt no one had the right to interfere in his affairs with his wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's fists clenched tightly. It was precisely because of Steven and Diana's marital relationship that he had no grounds to stop Steven from taking her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to help Diana, but he didn't want to cause her any trouble or expose her to rumors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven turned to Diana, his eyes carrying a warning. "Diana, I've warned you before. Mr. Powell has just returned to the country and hasn't firmly established himself yet. If there are any scandals involving him and you, it would be a serious blow to him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was stunned. She had been so focused on the collaboration that she hadn't considered this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Alexander was still in a developing phase and didn't want to cause him any trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want to jeopardize his progress, especially since her future was tied to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander spoke up angrily, "Steven, you don't need to use this to threaten Diana. There's nothing between her and me, unlike the shady mess between you and Queenie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was usually calm and composed, rarely commenting on others' affairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Steven had truly angered him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's lips curled into a cold, mocking smile as he stared icily at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana recognized this as a sign Steven was furious. She knew he was extremely angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was aware of just how ruthless Steven could be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It dawned on her that she had forgotten Alexander hadn't yet fully established himself in Capitole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana took a deep breath. She despised Steven's way of threatening her. She said, "Alexander, don't worry. Finish your dinner and head back. I'll text you once I'm home safely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She gave him a reassuring smile. "Alexander, you don't need to worry about me. I can take care of myself."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="587.html">« Prev</a><a href="589.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
