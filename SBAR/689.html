Diana didn't call him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven thought, "As her husband, when she got into trouble and explained, I didn't listen. Instead, I joined Queenie and others to bully her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't know when it started, but I was the one who pushed away the woman who loved me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven suddenly saw the news that the police had taken Diana away near the shopping mall. He trembled. He picked up the car keys on the table, left the office, and went to the police station.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Staggs family lived in a large flat in the city center. Her parents had always lived in the city for work.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Jasmine was holding a tablet and felt good at seeing Diana being scolded.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was chatting with Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Queenie, Diana will be dead this time.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie: [Thank you, Jasmine. Once this matter is over, I will help you arrange the cooperation that your father wants.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine was happy because she could share work chores with her father, Brad Staggs.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "My parents will definitely be happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, there was an angry knock on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine was startled.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She put the tablet down and went to open the door. She was startled to see angry Brad.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine took a quick step back because she had never seen Brad so angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, what's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad showed Jasmine the video on his phone. He asked angrily, "Jasmine, is Queenie your mother or your grandmother? Why are you doing this for her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad was too angry to say such things. All his life's work was ruined.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine was scared and started crying. "Dad, what are you talking about? She is my friend. I have known her since college. She is nice to me. Didn't you know that all along?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay! She is nice to you. We, as your parents, are bad to you. I will help you pack your things now. Go live at her house. You can do whatever she asks you to do then. We can't do anything about it. You can do whatever you want.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We asked you to study hard, but you felt that we were forcing you. She just said it, and you helped her clarify things on the Internet. She is your savior. Go find her now and let her take good care of your life in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine was shocked and cried. She had never seen such a terrible Brad.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, don't. I'm scared. What's wrong with you? Why do you say this to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad's eyes were bloodshot. He had cried before and felt miserable. He whispered, "Nothing. I just feel like I'm a failure as a father. I asked you to study hard, but you didn't listen. I asked you to learn management skills, and you didn't listen either. You think that playing with your friends is your life and the life you should live. I'll grant your wish then.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't Queenie quite amazing? You will definitely have a good life with her, better than living with us."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Brad turned around and said to the servant behind him, "Come in and help her pack her things. After 10 minutes, tell her to get out of here and not come back again."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine was stunned. Her ivory tower collapsed. She didn't understand. "Dad, even if you want me to get out, you have to give me a reason. How could you kick me out just because of this video? Have you ever treated me as your daughter? I'm telling the truth. Isn't it right for me to speak up for my friend?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="688.html">« Prev</a><a href="690.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
