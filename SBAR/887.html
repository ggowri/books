You think you can win men over with your looks and climb the social ladder using their status. That&#x27;s not your real fault, though. Your fault lies in draining Paula dry and stepping over her to get ahead.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Queenie, you&#x27;ve succeeded before, thanks to my stupidity. That&#x27;s the only reason you had an opportunity.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie frowned, her face full of doubt. What was Diana talking about?</p><p style="text-align:left;">A gust of cold wind blew past, making her shiver. Yet, Diana stood firmly in front of the door, blocking her way.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie&#x27;s voice trembled as she asked, &quot;Diana, what do you mean by that?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana smiled and shook her head. &quot;Nothing much. I just think you&#x27;re quite something.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie frowned, watching her smile. She had a nagging feeling Diana knew something.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Diana, you don&#x27;t have to be so sarcastic. Move aside—I need to see Steven.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana didn&#x27;t budge. &quot;Queenie, the evidence of you instructing the housekeeper to poison his grandmother is all there—on video. And yet, you still dare come looking for Steven? Aren&#x27;t you afraid he&#x27;ll turn you in?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie froze. Impossible! The housekeeper wouldn&#x27;t betray her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Then she laughed, confident and pleased.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Diana, if Steven wanted to send me to jail, he would&#x27;ve done it when he found out about the housekeeper. And yet, here I am, perfectly fine.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I&#x27;ve told you before—no matter what I do, Steven will forgive me unconditionally.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana&#x27;s heart ached sharply. &quot;Yes, sometimes I envy you. You had a man who adored you completely, and you ruined it by being involved with other men.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie clenched her fists, gripping the handle of the gift bag so tightly her knuckles whitened.</p><p style="text-align:left;">On the surface, she remained calm, her tone full of pride. &quot;Diana, even if I cheated, Steven still loves me madly. He still visits me in the hospital and stays by my side.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;With him, the damsel-in-distress act works like a charm.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Steven&#x27;s feelings for me run deep. After all, I&#x27;m the one who saved his life.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Tsk!&quot; Diana scoffed, shaking her head at Queenie&#x27;s arrogance. &quot;Saved him? Queenie, when did you ever save him? You&#x27;re the one who&#x27;s been trying to kill him all along.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie&#x27;s gaze faltered, panic flashing through her heart. &quot;Diana, what nonsense are you spouting? This is none of your business. Move out of my way—I&#x27;m going to see Steven.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana stood her ground. &quot;Queenie, you&#x27;re not getting in today. If you go anywhere, it&#x27;ll be to the police station...&quot; &quot;You&#x27;d better leave now. Don&#x27;t ruin our lunch. If you do, I won&#x27;t hesitate to take the evidence I have straight to the police. No matter how capable Steven is, even he won&#x27;t be able to clear your name.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Or I could expose all of this online. Your choice.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie glared at her coldly, but in her heart, she already knew what she needed to confirm.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She had rushed over to find out exactly how much Steven knew.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Zora wouldn&#x27;t betray her. She was sure of it—she was too smart for that.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The result was as she expected. Even if Steven knew about the slow poisoning of his grandmother, he wouldn&#x27;t have her arrested.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie sneered. &quot;Fine. I won&#x27;t go in. But let me make one thing clear—you&#x27;ll never have Steven as long as I&#x27;m around.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana shook her head. &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t want a man like him after he&#x27;s been tainted. He&#x27;s all yours—perfect for someone with your messy relationships.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Ha! Diana, you can&#x27;t seduce men yourself, so you call me filthy? Get real. A woman&#x27;s youth and beauty are her greatest assets. That&#x27;s why you&#x27;ve always been so broke.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana&#x27;s words infuriated Queenie. She decided Diana had to go.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Soon, Diana would be out of her way for good.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana laughed in anger. &quot;Queenie, you can insult yourself all you want on your way to hell. Your life has nothing to do with me. But I&#x27;ll say it again—every time you cross me, I&#x27;ll pay you back tenfold.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana didn&#x27;t want to argue anymore.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The fact that Queenie was still here proved to Diana that Steven wouldn&#x27;t do anything to her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She already knew the answer, but her heart still ached, even if she&#x27;d grown numb to it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">With a loud slam, she shut the door.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana smiled faintly. At last, peace and quiet.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie was seething, unable to understand why Steven wouldn&#x27;t divorce Diana if he didn&#x27;t love her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She turned, and suddenly, she saw Steven standing behind her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His tall figure, cold features, and imposing presence overwhelmed her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie parted her lips slightly, staring at Steven in shock.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Steven, you...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">How long had he been there?</p><p style="text-align:left;">How much had he heard?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Nervous, Queenie&#x27;s grip faltered, and the gift bag in her hand fell to the floor.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven&#x27;s gaze was cold and piercing. He smirked slightly. &quot;I&#x27;ve been here for a while. I heard everything you said to Diana.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Fear spread through Queenie&#x27;s chest like wildfire.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She quickly tried to cover, &quot;Steven, don&#x27;t take those words to heart. Diana and I were just messing around. You know how women are—always competing. It was just some harmless chatter.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Harmless chatter?&quot; Steven&#x27;s tone was icy, his smile chilling.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie couldn&#x27;t read what Steven was thinking. She was tense, terrified by his cryptic expression.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Steven, the thing with Mrs. Gellar—it wasn&#x27;t me! Zora wanted money from me. She did it all on her own. It has nothing to do with me.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;All I did was give her a little money to find out what you like. I know how busy you are... You used to want to marry me, but Mr. Gellar and Mrs. Gellar didn&#x27;t approve. I only gave Zora money to understand their preferences—I never told her to poison anyone.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Diana said that to ruin me, Steven. I grew up with you—don&#x27;t you know my character by now?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Yes, you grew up with me. But you&#x27;re a ghost, Queenie. I never truly saw who you were.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie froze, speechless.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She bit her lip in frustration.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Steven, how can you say that about me? I... I only said those things because of my issues with Diana. Don&#x27;t take it to heart.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Damn Diana, ruining her image in Steven&#x27;s heart again and again.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Did Diana see Steven earlier and deliberately bait her into saying those things?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana&#x27;s schemes were growing more calculated. And why hadn&#x27;t Samuel, that useless idiot acted yet?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Oh? And what do you expect me to say? Queenie, did you know? Before Diana came into my life, I actually considered marrying you... But after marrying Diana, I never wanted to marry you again.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He took a step closer, his smile turning sardonic. &quot;Queenie, do you know why?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="886.html">« Prev</a><a href="888.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
