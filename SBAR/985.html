"Diana," she said with a sly grin, "how can this be pointless? Ms. Barnes did this to completely destroy Queenie's career in the entertainment industry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She paused and added, "If I recall correctly, today is the release day of Queenie's new film. What Ms. Barnes has done is perfectly timed to end her career for good."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana froze momentarily, realizing Paula had finally launched her counterattack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula was always resourceful, Diana knew that. But no matter how clever Paula was, she could never match Queenie's venomous schemes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana didn't want to watch, yet she couldn't look away. She was desperate to know how it would all end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wanted to see just how far Paula would go, and whether Paula truly felt nothing for Queenie anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once Queenie had dealt with it, it would be Jeff's turn next.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the clubhouse, Paula wiped her tears and stared coldly at the gloating Queenie. "Keep smiling while you can," Paula thought. "Your time is almost up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was certain that the live stream audience must already be tearing Queenie apart in the comments.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula fixed her icy gaze on Queenie's smug, malicious face and said, "Queenie, even after I disowned Diana and cut ties with her, you still refused to leave her alone. You plotted against her over and over again. You even stole her designs, didn't you? You stole her work and had the audacity to accept an award for it. Was that design even yours?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How could you steal Diana's designs?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie let out a mocking laugh, her tone dripping with arrogance and shamelessness. "I didn't plan to steal her designs. I just wanted to see what was on her phone. Her design sketches happened to catch my eye, so I took them. I didn't expect her to have any real talent, but the designs turned out to be pretty decent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She was born to be my stepping stone. Of course, I had to crush her. Everything she has should belong to me, so what's the big deal if I took a few sketches?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And besides, she always wanted to stay low-key. With her so-called talent, she should've been able to outshine me even if I took her work. But guess what? She didn't."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She smirked at Paula, her words full of venom. "You see, Paula, I've hurt Diana time and time again, but as her mother, what could you do about it? You could only stand by and watch as I broke her down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She was born a loveless bastard. Sure, she's your daughter, but what does that matter? You're her biological mother, yet you hurt her worse than anyone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She hates you to the core now. And so what if she's 'precious' and 'noble'? She's still nothing but a bastard."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie threw all the blame onto Paula without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not satisfied with her words, she added, "And your sons, oh, they're as stupid as they come. All it took was a little nudge from me, and they turned on their own sister, each one more ruthless than the last. The sons you raised, Paula, are nothing but fools.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you truly loved someone, truly cared for them, your heart and eyes would only hold them. But you? Your heart and eyes were always on me, never on Diana. That's why she was so desperate and signed the disownment papers."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Queenie spoke, her face twisted with malice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, she screamed, "Paula! My father has been poisoning you with slow-acting toxins. Once the poison took effect, he planned to lock you away in a mental hospital. But he didn't succeed in the end. Tell me, how did you realize the medication was tainted?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula's heart ached. She knew her sons' flaws all too well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was easy to go astray, but it took a lifetime to change for the better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She laughed coldly and said, "How I figured it out doesn't matter. But during your birthday party, I learned that you're the daughter of a mistress. After I discovered the truth, I stopped taking the medicine. Your father ran into a series of problems after that, his health deteriorated, my company hit a crisis, and he was too busy stealing from me to continue poisoning me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And I knew about your plan all along. At the time, my company was in trouble. To protect what little assets I had left, I had no choice but to sell them off. At least now, I don't have to worry about ending up on the streets."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula's lips curled into a sinister smile as her tone shifted dramatically. "Queenie, congratulations. You're live streaming right now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The moment Paula finished speaking, Queenie's pupils shrank in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What did you say? We're live streaming?" Queenie asked, her voice trembling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula pointed to a nearby camera. "That's right. I wanted everyone supporting you to see your true, vicious nature."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing Paula's confirmation, Queenie froze. Then, rage overtook her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She screamed hoarsely, "Paula, I'm your precious daughter! How could you ruin me like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula had expected this meltdown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her expression turned colder. "Why? Because you need to pay for your cruelty. I need justice for my daughter. You plotted against her, stole her designs, and manipulated my sons into hurting her. You deserve to face the consequences. Even though I don't have solid evidence, this live stream will expose your true face to everyone who knows you. No one will be fooled by you anymore. That's why I did this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie quickly regained her composure. Her face turned deathly pale, the fire in her eyes extinguished, leaving only a chilling void filled with malice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Paula, you're insane! If I become a world-renowned businesswoman, you'd benefit from it too. Why would you destroy me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only now did she recall the significance of the day. Her film was premiering. If this live stream went viral, her career would be over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her face turned ashen, her eyes hollow and lifeless as she stood there, dazed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie," Paula's raspy voice broke through her despair. "I raised you myself, and this is how you repay me? Poisoning me, stealing my assets, and trying to kill my children? Is this how you show gratitude?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula's words struck Queenie like a thunderclap, shattering the last threads of her sanity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You set me up, Paula! You'll pay for this," Queenie howled in anguish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She closed her eyes in torment, praying desperately that this was all just a nightmare. That when she woke, everything would be fine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula stood up, her gaze as cold as ice as she looked down at Queenie. A faint, enigmatic smile played on her lips. "Queenie, I had no idea you dreamt of becoming a global business icon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She realized that this was what had driven Queenie's relentless climb to the top.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie, however, felt like her dream had been smashed to pieces. Her life had been turned into a cruel joke by Paula. Her future had been obliterated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She couldn't even fathom what awaited her next.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="984.html">« Prev</a><a href="986.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
