She had loved him so much, pouring all her energy into </span><span>him.And</span><span> now she could just switch off her love like it was nothing!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their special couple's mugs lay shattered on the floor, and she didn't seem to care one bit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven felt a frustration he'd never experienced, even when Queenie went abroad.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, don't use that tone with me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana furrowed her brow, meeting his stormy gaze with confusion. "What more do you want from me? When you teamed up with the Marsh family to drive me away, you should've expected I'd treat you like this."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I told </span><span>you,</span><span> I was wrong about what happened before. I made a mistake."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And I told you, I don't accept your apology."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They stared at each other in silence. Steven was fuming while Diana remained calm, her resistance unspoken but palpable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Where the hell is Queenie?" Diana thought.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Did she see my post?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her unfamiliar eyes, feeling a twinge in his chest. An odd sensation washed over him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He suddenly stood up, walked over, and pulled Diana to her feet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana frowned. "What are you doing?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We're going to buy wedding rings," Steven said, dragging her towards the door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was stunned. "Wedding rings? Now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This lunatic had lost it, and she wasn't about to play along with his madness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, let go! I'm not buying any rings. We're done, there's no future for us. What's the point of rings?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven abruptly stopped, warning her, "Diana, playing hard to get only works to a point."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana froze, staring at him in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Does he actually think I'm still playing hard to get?" she thought.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It must be that she'd been so good to him these past few years that it gave him the wrong idea that she couldn't live without him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once upon a time, that had been true. She'd been lovesick, unable to be apart from Steven, constantly feeling uneasy if she couldn't see him. Her whole world had revolved around him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter what she did, he was always her first thought.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afraid of disturbing him when he was busy with work, she'd hesitate to reach out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Worried about his stomach issues, she'd always make medicinal soups for him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, living this life over again, she wouldn't want a scumbag!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Diana was anxiously trying to figure out how to turn Steven down, suddenly, a blinding light flashed outside the window. A sly smile played at the corners of her mouth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment Steven opened the door, Queenie came charging in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Steven holding Diana's hand, she was furious. Jealousy consumed her. "How dare Steven hold Diana's hand?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No way!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not bothering to hide her shrew-like behavior, Queenie lashed out. "Diana, you shameless bitch! You're divorced now and you're still trying to seduce Steven?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven furrowed his brow, staring at the fuming Queenie with anger smoldering in his eyes. "Queenie, what the hell are you doing here at this hour?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his cold tone, Queenie arched an eyebrow and fixed Steven with a hurt look. "Steven, if I hadn't come, you would've let that woman back in, wouldn't you? You promised you'd marry me. When I left back then, you said you'd wait for me to come back. But you didn't. Are you going to break your word again?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven frowned. He had said that it was true.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he was already married to Diana. A verbal promise, naturally, meant nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He recalled what Diana had told him. He didn't want to be played for a fool. Now, he only wanted to know if Queenie had left him years ago because he was blind, running off with another man, or if she had been after the entire Gellar family fortune.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once doubt crept in, he knew he had to get to the bottom of it.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="78.html">« Prev</a><a href="80.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
