"Mom, things aren't the same anymore. My company has been sold, and I don't have much money left.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop giving my brother money. I don't have any left to give you. Even if you threatened to jump off a building, I couldn't come up with the cash."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at her with a pained expression. "Mom, you've given so much to him, but do you think his wife is willing to take care of you? In the end, you'll have nothing. You should just go back to our hometown. Here, no one's going to help you. For over twenty years, I've been supporting the entire Marsh family, but I can't do it anymore. If you want money, you might as well take my life."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tracey was stunned, looking at Jeff's defeated demeanor, nearly fainting from the shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her family once lived a carefree life with Paula's support, but now they have nothing. The feeling of falling from the sky to the ground was simply too painful for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was well aware of what another daughter-in-law was like. In the end, it was Paula who was both foolish and dutiful as a daughter-in-law.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Paula was gone, and Tracey was filled with regret. She felt that even if Paula had no money, she wouldn't have left her homeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she had burned that bridge with her harsh words, and Paula likely wouldn't care about her anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she redirected her anger at Jeff. "You useless fool! You gave up a great future for Amelie, a mistress who can't even hold her own. Look at the mess you've made of your life now! I don't care how you do it, but you must give me one hundred thousand dollars every month to pay off your brother's debts."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff let out a bitter laugh. "Then go earn it yourself to pay off his debts. I'm barely alive here. You would still be living in the countryside if it weren't for me and Paula."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you're my son! How could you say that to me?" Tracey hadn't been spoken to like this in years. When there was money, everyone was kind and cordial.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without money, everything really did change.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Diana tried to leave, Steven pulled her into his car.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He drove straight home.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way, neither of them said a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven knew that Diana was furious because he had threatened her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they drove, Steven kept glancing at the rearview mirror.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he exited the banquet earlier, he had noticed a few suspicious men lingering nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they hadn't followed him, he was certain that Samuel, known for his vengeful nature, wouldn't let Diana off so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Checking the mirror again, he saw Diana sitting in the back seat, her expression cold and her eyes fixed on the snowy landscape outside. He thought to himself, "It's snowing heavily, the fog is thick, and all there is to see are cars and pedestrians. What's so fascinating out there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It annoyed him that Diana treated him like a mere chauffeur, not even bothering to sit in the front passenger seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since she had obediently gotten into the car, he let it slide. If she wanted him to be her driver, so be it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they neared their home, Steven finally spoke, issuing a stern warning, "Stay away from Cecil from now on."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Diana seem to snap out of her thoughts. Hearing his threat made her anger flare. "You're still trying to threaten me? You used my brother to force me to comply, and I gave in. But as for Cecil, we collaborate professionally. Are you planning to keep me locked up here forever?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, I've told you before, there is no future for us.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your years of indifference and emotional cruelty killed all the love I had for you.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your bias and shameless behavior have completely crushed my heart. Even if I choose to love someone else, it will never be you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven abruptly slammed on the brakes, the car coming to a screeching halt. He turned to face her, his eyes deep and cold as he glared at her. "Diana, I dare you to say that again."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="658.html">« Prev</a><a href="660.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
