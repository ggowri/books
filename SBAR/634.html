How can you say that? You were the one who kept telling me to leave and insisted on a divorce. I went along with it, but why did you give me this? What do you really think of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face flushed with anger, and her voice trembled with tears. She was clearly irritated.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven watched her pain, knowing he was the cause of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was still trying to sort out his own feelings. "Diana, I just need you to stay here until next year. Once the two years are up, I'll divorce you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana scoffed, "What does where I live have anything to do with it? After two years of separation, I can file for divorce myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if I disagree, you won't be able to get one," he replied calmly, his tone tinged with a subtle threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears of anger welled up in Diana's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Steven disagreed, she couldn't get a divorce.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her previous life, he had agreed to a divorce, but later, she found herself pregnant.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Steven changed his mind. During that time, Steven treated her very well, but he went out early and came back late.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kept her locked away in a villa, preventing her from going out and taking away her means of contacting the outside world.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until Queenie had her kidnapped that she managed to escape, only to meet her death.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During those months, Steven was often irritated and would visit her, but he was always busy and would leave after breakfast. He never shared what was happening outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana assumed that Queenie had taken control of his company, which explained his constant absence.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana collapsed onto the floor, whispering, "Steven, please don't hurt Tobias. I'll stay here."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the previous life, Tobias had been killed by a killer hired by Queenie in order to avenge her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Tobias was on the rise, and as long as he held power, he could protect her. Together, they could confront Steven, Queenie, and the man behind Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned at her compliance, realizing she was staying not for him, but for Tobias.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, she'd gone to great lengths to win his affection, but now, she wanted none of his kindness.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze grew icy, and he helped her up from the floor. "We'll go back to how things were. You'll cook for me, and I'll try to come home for dinner every night. Breakfast will be the same as before."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He missed the way she used to care for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During her absence, Steven had struggled terribly&mdash;he hadn't eaten or slept well.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never known love from anyone but Diana, who had genuinely cared for him, and he had pushed that love away.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People often realized the value of something after they had lost it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He admitted that he was greedy for Diana's sincerity.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once, she had nearly died searching for medicine for him, and she had saved him from a fire, all out of love.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana quietly replied, "Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She avoided looking at him, tossing her bag onto the bed and sitting on the edge, staring blankly ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven watched her in silence, wanting to say something but finding the words escaping him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't bear to see her in such despair, so he turned and left the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he stood in the unfamiliar villa, he felt empty. The strange surroundings unsettled him, but the thought of Diana inside brought a small smile to his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was glad that she was here with him.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="633.html">« Prev</a><a href="635.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
