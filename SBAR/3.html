Diana finally agreed to get divorced, and Steven was finally going to be hers alone.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven had already signed on the divorce agreement, and after Diana signed, it would have legal effect.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana lifted her head and handed the divorce papers to Steven. </p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">For the first time in their two-year marriage, he really looked at her closely. Her fair skin and clear eyes, along with her black dress, made her look both elegant and laid-back. Her gaze was icy, proud, and full of life, captivating anyone who looked at her. </p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But the love that used to fill her eyes for him was gone. Steven suddenly felt a wave of panic, like something important was slipping away. He gripped the divorce papers tighter and tighter.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana turned to Queenie. "Ms. Marsh, are you happy now?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie was more than happy. She was ecstatic!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wasn't this why she went all the way to plot against Diana? She finally got&nbsp;to drive her out in front of so many relatives and friends!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She finally got what she wanted.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, please don't say that. I never meant to blame you..." Queenie was busy trying to squeeze out some tears again.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yeah, you never blamed me. You just kept pushing my family away from me. Congrats. You win!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana glanced at his parents and four indifferent brothers and smiled with relief.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She checked the time and then walked away, calm and graceful. Twenty minutes were almost up, and the show was about to start. </p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Marsh family had planed a birthday party for Queenie today, but she got kidnapped and nearly assaulted. Megan, Queenie's maid, claimed Diana was behind it, so Steven, furious, knocked Diana out. After all, he and Queenie had grown up together. </p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana counted down silently in her head, "Five, four, three, two, one." Suddenly, a video showed up on the screen behind her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Ms. Marsh, if you want Diana out of the Marsh family forever and to make Mr. Gellar divorce her, there is only one way. But you will suffer a little because someone will kidnap you to frame Diana. Everyone loves and pampers you. As long as you say she&rsquo;s behind the kidnapping, everyone will believe you. "</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Megan, what if we are exposed?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Relax, Ms. Marsh. We've done something like that before. No matter how Diana tried to explain it, Steven never believed her. He doesn't love Diana at all. He loves you. The person he has always loved is you. You are his angel. How could he not believe you? "</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Megan, I..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Don&rsquo;t worry. I got this. I will try&nbsp;to get Diana out early that day and let someone at home testify against Diana, then&nbsp;we can kick her out completely..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Every guest was astonished...</p><div class="pagination"><a href="2.html">« Prev</a><a href="4.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
