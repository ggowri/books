He knew Diana.</span><span> </span><span>Owen looked at Steven suddenly. The soft light shone on his handsome face, leaving a shadow, but his face was cold.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the young men who were playing cards not far away felt a chill, and their backs were covered in cold sweat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen was depressed. He had been away for several months. He didn't know what had happened.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was also depressed. He shoul</span><span>dn</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>t</span><span> sit here and ask for </span><span>it</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was always against Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Powell, Diana is still my wife." Steven </span><span>coldly </span><span>reminded him again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander looked at Steven with a smile. "I heard </span><span>from </span><span>Diana that she divorced you</span><span> </span><span>several months</span><span> ago</span><span>. And I have investigated</span><span> it</span><span>. It was you who forced her to sign the divorce agreement, and she has already signed it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>You cheated on </span><span>her to be with </span><span>Queenie during your marriage. Everyone in </span><span>Capitole</span><span> knows that you and Queenie are a perfect match, but no one knows that Diana was your wife.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Therefore, the person who should be </span><span>staying away from her</span><span> is you, Mr. Gellar. Don't keep pestering my future girlfriend."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Alexander finished speaking, Diana sent him another message.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>[Mr. Powell, I won't join you. I ate too much tonight. I'm going to take a walk. How about I treat you to dinner the day after tomorrow?]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander deliberately replied in front of Steven: [Okay! Diana.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said: [Great!]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander put away his phone and looked at Steven. "Mr. Gellar, do you know how I felt when I saw Diana for the first time?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's eyes were gloomy. He looked at Alexander</span><span>, silent</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander didn't care and was not afraid of Steven at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He picked up the wine on the table and took a sip elegantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then he said, "The first time I saw her, I knew she was the girl I wanted to marry all my life."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander wanted to say, "What you don't cherish is what others are longing for."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven wanted to punch him, but was stopped by Owen.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There seemed to be something wrong with the way he looked at Alexander.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was unfathomable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stood up and left. Owen looked at Alexander apologetically and said,</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Powell, enjoy your night. It's </span><span>on me </span><span>today. See you</span><span> next time</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled, "</span><span>See you</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen chased Steven out. And only after they got in the car did Owen couldn't help asking,</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, what happened?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven leaned against him with a headache and whispered, "Nothing."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen didn't believe what he said, but he knew that Steven had always loved Queenie. "I know you were forced to marry Diana at that time. Queenie has come back. It's okay for you to marry her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's obvious that Diana loves you very much. If you get divorced, she will definitely be very sad."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven thought of the image of Diana sitting on the stairs crying during the day. Her shoulders trembled, and she told the person on the phone that she would not love Steven anymore. He felt a pain in his heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven suddenly said, "But I don't want to get divorced."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen was stunned. "Isn't the person you love Queenie? Why don't you divorce?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven, you can't treat Diana like this. You love another woman. Now that Queenie is back, you should divorce. You are being unfair.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No one will wait for you forever. Diana has been ignored by you for two years.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Also, I don't understand what you're thinking. If there's a woman I like, I won't allow her to get entangled with others. But you're different."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven frowned. "Why don't you believe me? There's nothing between me and Queenie. She saved me back then, and I was just tolerant of her</span><span> </span><span>mistakes</span><span>, but I </span><span>won</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>t forgive her</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen frowned. Seeing that Steven was unwilling to say more, Owen did not ask any more questions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay, this has nothing to do with me. I just want to remind you that no matter how much hatred you have in your heart, don't hurt innocent women."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven thought of his mother who had suddenly gone crazy with a cold face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He always suspected that his mother's accident had something to do with the Marsh family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen was </span><span>resigned</span><span>. Steven was born with a cold personality. Owen thought Queenie was the most special one to Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen said, "But if you divorce Diana, it will be good for both you and Queenie..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>How</span><span>?" Steven's face was gloomy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He would not divorce Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Never mind. Let's go home."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven thought of Alexander's conversation with Diana and felt angry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought about what happened today and her conversation with Cecil.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hurt her twice in one day.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And there was someone behind Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven thought, "Did Diana say this on purpose, or did I not even understand Queenie?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The people behind Queenie wanted the Gellar family and the Farley family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why was she so ambitious and capable?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven still preferred Queenie in the end. He and Queenie grew up together. She couldn't be that ambitious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He convinced himself this way, but he still had doubts in his </span><span>mind</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What evidence </span><span>did</span><span> Cecil</span><span> have</span><span>?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana seemed to be very confident, but she was unwilling to show it. What was it?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven had never doubted Queenie, but </span><span>recently</span><span>, Queenie had frequently framed Diana</span><span> with </span><span>evidence. He wanted to investigate what happened back then.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sent a message to Evan.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Evan, secretly investigate the reason why Queenie left that year.]</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="64.html">« Prev</a><a href="66.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
