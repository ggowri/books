Her voice was icy. &quot;Jeff, after all these years of love, you disappoint me. To humiliate me like this in front of everyone. You&#x27;ve outdone yourself.&quot;</p><p>She gritted her teeth, glaring at him with anger and resentment. There was fire in her eyes, but her expression was that of a victim. It was hurt and helpless.</p><p>Jeff was stunned to see Paula like this.</p><p>He had never seen Paula so furious before.</p><p>Paula ignored him, pulled back the covers, grabbed the other woman by the hair, and slapped her with all her strength.</p><p>&quot;Slap...&quot;</p><p>She swung left and right, unleashing twenty years of bottled-up anger.</p><p>&quot;Ah... ah... help, help, Jeff, save me...</p><p>&quot;It hurts... it hurts so much... stop hitting me, help... ahhh...&quot;</p><p>Onlookers were stunned.</p><p>Cecil leaned toward Diana and whispered, &quot;Diana, what a show! Seeing Queenie act like a complete clown was so satisfying.&quot;</p><p>The setup was so obvious, yet the Marsh family couldn&#x27;t see through it and blamed everything on Diana.</p><p>It&#x27;s true. One can never wake up someone pretending to sleep.</p><p>Diana looked at the finished small cake, feeling a bit unsatisfied.</p><p>&quot;If only there was a drumstick too.&quot;</p><p>Cecil was speechless.</p><p>He laughed in disbelief. &quot;Why do you love drumsticks so much?&quot;</p><p>Diana raised an eyebrow at him. &quot;Because they&#x27;re delicious!&quot;</p><p>Cecil understood. Watching the drama made everything taste better.</p><p>&quot;Enough, Paula,&quot; a furious voice came from inside.</p><p>Paula was exhausted from hitting, and the woman lay on the bed, motionless.</p><p>Paula spotted a basin of water nearby, picked it up, and poured it over Jeff from head to toe.</p><p>Jeff was stunned. This was the most humiliating moment of his life.</p><p>What a disgrace. It&#x27;s truly mortifying.</p><p>Why had he even walked in here?</p><p>He had only come in because he saw his childhood sweetheart enter. Seeing her had rekindled his confidence, and he lost control for a moment...</p><p>With so many people at the banquet and the music so loud, how had they been heard so suddenly?</p><p>Paula let out a cold laugh, her voice filled with anger as she raised it intentionally, &quot;Enough? Jeff, do you really think this is enough? You humiliate me in front of everyone. Do I even matter to you?&quot;</p><p>Paula then approached Jace, bowed, and apologized, &quot;Mr. Foliot, I&#x27;m so sorry. I never expected these two shameless people to do something so disgusting at your banquet. You can handle them however you see fit.&quot;</p><p>Paula said this and walked away, completely washing her hands of the situation.</p><p>Jeff panicked, desperately giving Queenie signals, hoping she would save them.</p><p>&quot;Mr. Foliot, we... we were set up. How could I do something like this at your banquet?&quot; Jeff struggled to explain, insisting that they were framed. Only being framed could explain tonight&#x27;s events.</p><p>Jace didn&#x27;t respond; they just glared at him furiously.</p><p>It was only then that Queenie realized what her father and mother had done here.</p><p>Why them?</p><p>Why?</p><p>She had worked so hard to earn Jace&#x27;s trust.</p><p>But tonight&#x27;s events revealed her schemes, even to the seasoned businessman.</p><p>Queenie, enraged, asked, &quot;Dad, you say you were framed. Who framed you?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="200.html">« Prev</a><a href="202.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
