After all, Queenie is your friend. How can she be more important than your parents? Because of your actions, many partners have terminated their contracts with me. Our company went bankrupt in just two hours because I raised such a terrible daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You slander others easily just to speak up for your friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was also at the banquet last night. Mrs. Foliot was targeting the mistress. Why did you mess around?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go find your friends and live with them."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad cried as he said. He had worked hard for 20 years to build the company to its current success.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was all ruined by his daughter's action.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine was also stunned. She had just been happy because she wanted to get an investment for her father. But now, her family was doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head painfully. "It's impossible, Dad. Our company is a medium-sized enterprise. The scale has been expanding in the past two years. How could it be possible to go bankrupt so quickly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine couldn't believe this fact. She thought, "How could someone bankrupt our company within two hours?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad was sorrowful. He seemed to be deflated in an instant, as if he had aged a dozen years in an instant. "I also find it ridiculous. The results of my twenty years of hard work were suppressed in two hours. I have nothing left now. Steven and the Farley family took action."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad looked at Jasmine and asked, "Are you satisfied with this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine was distraught. Looking at the tears on Brad's face, she was trembling. She didn't know what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Jasmine's mother, Moira Staggs, rushed in quickly and slapped Jasmine hard on the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine was brought back to her senses by this slap. She looked at Moira with tears on her face and shouted in disbelief, "Mom, you hit me. You have never hit me before."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moira was beautiful. Even though she was in her middle age, she still had charm. Moira had a perfect figure. When she was angry, she was even trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cried and said, "Jasmine, is Queenie good to you? You spoke up for her and destroyed the Staggs family. How have your father and I wronged you over the years that you want to slander Diana for Queenie?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie is the child of her father and his mistress. Diana was abandoned by his biological father. Queenie is anxious to find you to clarify herself. She is using you. Don't you have a brain? She just wants to clarify herself and slander Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could you be so stupid? Now, our family is bankrupt. We have to mortgage this house to pay off the debt."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moira burst into tears and supported Brad. "Let's go pack our things first. As for her, let's send her abroad. If she doesn't want to go, I won't care about her. She is really born bad. How could I give birth to such a bad daughter?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have found out some of what she and Queenie did. It's terrible to have such a daughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moira felt regretful and blamed herself. She was even more angry because she had failed to discipline Jasmine and allowed Jasmine to be led astray by Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad and Moira went back to their room to pack their things.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine fell to the ground. She felt like the sky was falling, thinking, "How could our family suddenly go bankrupt?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isn't it just because of Diana?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cell phone suddenly vibrated. She picked it up and saw that it was a text message from an unfamiliar number.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Since you have chosen to be Queenie's dog, you must have the courage to bear the consequences.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it's impossible." Jasmine stood up quickly. Her legs were weak from being too nervous. Jasmine fell again. But she wanted to ask Queenie what the relationship between Diana and Cecil was.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Why did Cecil attack our family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine held the phone in trembling hands and called Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong, Jasmine?" asked Queenie with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine's voice was trembling. "Queenie, let me ask you something. Is it true that you were bullied by Diana?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="689.html">« Prev</a><a href="691.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
