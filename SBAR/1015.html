She forced him to sign a divorce agreement and took away all his properties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lying in bed, unable to get up or speak, he could only let others do whatever they wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Amelie woke up, she learned that Noah had slipped and fallen into the sea and disappeared without a trace while trying to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mental state became abnormal. She would call out anyone she saw as her son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She got into a fight, and it ended up being brought to Queenie's attention. Queenie paid a large sum of money before they sent her to the police.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at her disheveled mother and suddenly realized that she had originally intended to drive Paula crazy, but now the retribution had fallen on her own mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie became mentally ill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She murmured, "Hey, little girl, have you seen my son? He is tall and handsome. He is very filial, unlike my daughter. She doesn't care about me. Can you take me to find my son?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was devastated by Noah's death and could no longer recognize Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Queenie thought of Jenny. This scene was so familiar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenny went crazy back then. She was also disheveled and asked with her head tilted, "Little girl, who are you? Do you know where my son is? I want to find him. Can you take me? He is very handsome."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie staggered back a few steps, staring at her silly-smiling mother in a daze with tears in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "No, it's not like that. Mom, look at me. It's me, Queenie. I didn't abandon you. What I said was just angry words. Please look at me, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tightly grasped her shoulders with both hands and shook her vigorously, trying to bring her to her senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when she heard the name Queenie, she was very excited and said, "Queenie, you are such an ungrateful wretch. Your father treats you very well. Why don't you save him? In this world, your father is the only one who has your best interests at heart. If Paula and the others had known that you were not their biological daughter, how could they be good to you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, you are an ungrateful person. How could you scheme against your father? How could you not save your brother? How could you abandon me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at her with an expression of disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's heart was deeply hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie's eyes were filled with hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she was a child, every time she went to see her mother, she was always gentle and kind. Each time, she would embrace her, eyes brimming with tears, reluctant to let her leave. At that moment, she secretly vowed to herself that she would make sure Amelie returned to her side in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She loved her mother more than anyone else. Also, she didn't want her to live in darkness all her life but to be Mrs. Marsh with dignity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, she began to calculate everything about Paula. Every time she got hurt, they would give her a lot of money. And then she would give this money to Amelie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first thing she would do when she got the money was to buy her a gift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She believed that Amelie really loved her at that time, and she loved her the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grew up striving hard and became the most outstanding one among Paula's five children.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she couldn't expose herself. Her four useless brothers must be punished. They owed it to her and Amelie. Every time she saw Paula's happy face, she would think of the moments when Amelie was in tears. The hatred she harbored towards Paula in her heart grew a bit deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew very well that she was born because of their affair. It was her father's fault, and Amelie was too greedy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even though she knew these truths, she still, without hesitation, wanted Amelie to be an open and aboveboard mother in this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With such thoughts in mind, she had come this far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could do business and calculate everything she wanted. She didn't need a man's salvation. She believed she'd have a new life of her own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Paula's charity, their family would have lived happily together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She held onto that belief and made her way here step by step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now she could provide everything for herself, yet her mother had gone mad, her father was paralyzed in bed, and her brother fell into the sea, leaving her all alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Amelie's confused eyes, she loathed herself so much. Why did she have to go through pain before realizing that she had done something wrong?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had struggled so hard to get to where she was. Why arrange such an ending for her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She also wanted to make it up for her mother. What she said were just angry words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Noah, he did this to himself. It was he himself who went to the casino and ruined his own life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Queenie truly experienced what real pain and sorrow meant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought of Diana. Not trusted by anyone and bullied by all of them, she endured it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Diana hadn't waited for Steven's eyes to heal before striking back, she wouldn't have had the confidence to plot against Paula.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimately, her confidence stemmed from the trust and love she received from Steven and Paula.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was so spoiled by praise that she got carried away. But in fact, she was the one who was completely ruined by overindulgence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a pity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie didn't want to regret what she had done. But at this moment, she still deeply regretted it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no turning back for her now. Even if it was the wrong path, she had to keep going to the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She no longer harbored any hope for family or love even if she was filled with guilt and remorse. Only towards her own goals could she be driven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sent Amelie to a mental hospital and then sent Jeff to a sanatorium for recuperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were the only close relatives she had in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah made the headlines the next day. His body was found, his hands and feet were chopped off, and he died in the cold sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The authorities informed Queenie to claim his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his corpse, there was not even a trace of fear shown on her face. She just thought this was rather strange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything that should have happened to Cecil occurred to Noah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil also saw his corpse, with hands and feet missing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, he was in Diana's office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw the video on his mobile phone, he was nervous and scared that he closed his eyes in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This way of dying was exactly like what he had dreamed of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly put the phone in front of Diana, who was looking at the contract and was startled by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She frowned and looked at him. She asked, "Cecil, instead of going to your company, what are you doing here scaring me?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1014.html">« Prev</a><a href="1016.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
