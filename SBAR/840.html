Grandpa is overseas and can't make it back. Are you really going to let her spend the holidays all alone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana raised an eyebrow, puzzled. "But Grandma has you. You can go home and keep her company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned, and his expression serious. "Aren't we supposed to spend Christmas together as a couple?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn't help but laugh, tilting her head back to look at him. "That's rich! Sure, we're married, but every Christmas, you're off with Queenie. This year, you're not spending it with her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't, she'll find a way to make my life miserable until you do. So, for the sake of my own peace of mind, let's just spend the holidays apart. We're practically on the road to divorce anyway. If it weren't for your threats, I'd be abroad right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's bright mood evaporated in an instant, leaving her pale and silent as she focused on her breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's expression darkened as he thought, "It's that woman again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's shadow always looms over our lives."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a tense breakfast, they parted ways without a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was unaware that Diana was participating in today's fashion designer competition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was curious about it; his company needed fresh talent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he went with Evan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Diana and Luna were on their way to the competition as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The event was hosted at the Capitole Hotel, chosen by the Fashion Association.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they arrived, they spotted Queenie and her team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie eyed Diana, who was bundled up in a pink down jacket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smirk spread across her face. "Diana, what's with the outfit? You're wearing a puffy coat to a competition? As a fashion designer, you should lead by example and embody the spirit of fashion at all times."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana raised an eyebrow, unfazed by Queenie's taunt. "Queenie, what I wear is none of your business. Maybe you should mind your own affairs. Your health isn't great; if you keep dressing like that, you won't just struggle with pregnancy&mdash;you might end up losing your uterus. Given how wild you get when you're out having fun, I wouldn't be surprised if a doctor told you it's all pretty dirty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was momentarily speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at her entourage, her anger boiling over as she raised her hand to strike Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, a strong hand grabbed her wrist, stopping her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie looked up in surprise to see Steven standing there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven," she exclaimed, taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at her, his expression icy. "Queenie, what are you doing here acting like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was about to hit Diana!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, it's all Diana's fault! She's slandering my name, and I couldn't help but want to teach her a lesson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled coolly. "Queenie, your reputation is already in the gutter. Do you really think I need to slander you? Just take a look online&mdash;your name and your mother's have gone international, and it's all negative press."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had been through this before. In her past life, Steven had protected Queenie, refusing to acknowledge their marriage, and she ended up being branded as the homewrecker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The anger bubbled up inside her, and she snapped. "Come on, Mr. Gellar, enough with the theatrics. You know why I'm here, right? It's because your beloved Queenie secretly signed me up for this competition. Otherwise, I wouldn't even want to see you two. It's disgusting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Diana turned and walked into the venue with Luna.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="839.html">« Prev</a><a href="841.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
