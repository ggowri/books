In half a month, when the competition starts, you will be doomed. When he knows the truth, he will be so angry and you will pay for it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Diana finished speaking, she ignored Gale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She dared to mention what happened half a year ago. Looking at the company in front of him, he decided to take revenge for what happened last time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He must let Diana taste the feeling of being betrayed by her loved ones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale loved Penelope so much, but that woman just took advantage of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale took out his cell phone and made a call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Gale."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The person's voice sounded vulgar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale sneered, "Tonight, help me teach someone a lesson. Her name&rsquo;s Diana. I'll send you her company address. Don't beat her to death, just teach her a lesson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Okay!" The other party agreed readily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Gale finished his call, he called Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie's voice was weak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale felt distressed when he heard this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He said, "Queenie, Diana won't come back to apologize to you, but I'll find someone to teach her a lesson and make her jobless. She can only look up to you in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale thought of what happened half a year ago with hatred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Gale, don't do this. It doesn't matter if Diana doesn't apologize. I know you haven't been in a good mood recently. You are going to the competition and can't do anything illegal," Queenie advised him nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale smiled, "Thank you. Don't worry, I won't do anything illegal. She plotted against me half a year ago and hurt Penelope. I can't forgive her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Gale, thank you for being so nice to me..." Queenie cried with emotion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale said some comforting words before hanging up the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He looked at the gate of Diana's company and said, "Diana, I don't want to do this to you, but you are going too far."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was his biological sister. As long as she apologized to Queenie, Gale would not treat her like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale didn't think much about it and went to the convoy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie practiced piano at home. She must win first place in the piano competition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After a while, she received a call from Gale, who would teach Diana a lesson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That was great. Queenie's plot against Diana half a year ago was just to make Gale completely hate Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now Gale finally decided to take action against Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As long as Paula went bankrupt, Queenie could secretly buy up the Barnes family's shares.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie sent a message and continued practicing the piano, waiting for good news about Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She thought, "Diana, you will be doomed!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Steven left that night, he never contacted with Queenie again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This meant that Steven no longer believed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie was angry. After planning for so long, Diana still escaped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven no longer believed Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie needed to find another way. She needed to do something to his beloved grandmother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie's smile was vicious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana didn't know about this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In her previous life, she met Gale just before the competition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In this life, many things happened ahead of time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At four o'clock in the afternoon, after Diana finished her work, she took Luna to the beauty salon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The place was close, so they walked over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana chatted with Luna about company matters as they walked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">All the fabrics she needed were selected. Now the most important design drawings could not be leaked. She had personally handed this matter over to Nolan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The two walked deeper into the alley. Suddenly, five men jumped out from another alley and blocked their way.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="114.html">« Prev</a><a href="116.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
