It's just a fashion competition, nothing to stress over."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana wasn't concerned about the competition. Her focus was on her own safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having been given a second chance, she valued her life more than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna knew what Diana was capable of.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She handed Diana a set of design blueprints.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, here's the design Nolan sent over. Take a look first; the technical team has confirmed everything is in order. Once you approve, construction can start right after Christmas."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana took the blueprints with a smile. She'd already reviewed them once before.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Opening them again, she carefully went through each detail, noticing that Nolan had made all the changes she requested.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After about half an hour, she finished her review. Handing the blueprints back to Luna, she said, "All set. Pass these on to Nolan and have him start the project after the holidays."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew the stocks she'd bought would yield a nice profit. This resort project wouldn't need any outside investment. She could fund it all on her own.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna noticed the spark of excitement in Diana's eyes, a sure sign she was plotting another way to make money.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, Diana, I'll drop these off now. On my way back, I'll grab lunch. Anything specific you'd like?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought about it but didn't have any strong cravings.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the chilly weather, she wanted something comforting, maybe a casserole, though she couldn't have that every day.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing special, just decide when you're back. We'll eat out."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it!" Luna replied cheerfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana opened her laptop and dove into her other tasks.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Queenie was busy arranging to see a doctor. She couldn't risk anyone finding out she was pregnant.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After spending a while at the office, she went to meet with Amelie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie had been in good spirits lately. With Lily gone, she and Mark could finally enjoy time alone together.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Queenie arrived home, she found her mother positively glowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, what's got you so happy?" Queenie asked, taking a seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her, only her birth mother truly cared about her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula treated her well enough, but there were still many things she wouldn't let Queenie be part of.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie smiled brightly, "Mark's ready to marry me. Now, I just have to figure out how to divorce your father. If I'd known he'd be this useless, I never would have married him in the first place. Now, he's just a hassle.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mark's company is flourishing, and that'll benefit both yours and your brother's businesses. That worthless father of yours has nothing left to offer."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flash of resentment showed in Amelie's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, I have to find a way to divorce your father. The Marsh family is complicated, and all his relatives expect us to support them. If I stay with him, they'll be here in no time, demanding money."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paula may indulge them, but we won't. We worked hard for our money; why should we give it to them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie felt the same. Before, she had no other options, but now things were different. She was ready to let that deadbeat Jeff fend for himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled slyly, "Mom, I know a way to get Dad to divorce you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie's eyes lit up. "What's the plan?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="738.html">« Prev</a><a href="740.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
