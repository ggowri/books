I also visited Gale. He&#x27;s doing well at the rehabilitation center, though he&#x27;s lost his memory. He doesn&#x27;t remember Paige or how he was hurt, and he doesn&#x27;t recall how Diana saved him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;His leg is slowly recovering. The doctors say that in another year, he&#x27;ll be able to stand and walk with support. He said he&#x27;ll focus on recovery and come back to help you when he&#x27;s ready.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula was pleased. In moments like this, patience was key.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Eric, the more critical the moment, the more we must stay calm. Don&#x27;t worry about him for now. Keep his whereabouts hidden so Queenie can&#x27;t find the rehabilitation center he&#x27;s staying at. Focus on managing things on your end. Make sure Queenie doesn&#x27;t find out that you&#x27;ve acquired Noah&#x27;s company. I know there&#x27;s someone behind Queenie, and that person is ruthless. Be extra cautious in all your dealings.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Eric said, &quot;Mom, I understand. I&#x27;m following Ave&#x27;s guidance. She&#x27;s brilliant in business, and I&#x27;ve learned a lot from her these past few days. If only I&#x27;d started learning from you earlier, our family wouldn&#x27;t be in this situation now.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula gave a bitter smile. &quot;It&#x27;s never too late to grow, as long as you&#x27;re willing.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">What followed would be bitter days for Amelie and Jeff.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She could&#x27;ve crushed them all at once, but where would the fun in that be?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Now was when things would get truly interesting.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Everything Amelie had ever wanted would turn to dust.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Everything Jeff had pursued throughout his entire life would amount to nothing.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Maeve wouldn&#x27;t spare Amelie. She&#x27;d pay dearly for her ambitions.</p><p style="text-align:left;">*****</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana spent the entire afternoon reviewing the information on all of Steven&#x27;s business partners.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After finishing, she called them one by one. Her professionalism in commercial matters, her use of technical terms, and her understanding of the products and projects successfully silenced any doubts among the partners, earning their respect.</p><p style="text-align:left;">By the end of the day, she had made one hundred calls. Her throat was parched, and her voice was hoarse.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Frustrated, Diana felt like smashing her phone.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She raised her phone, no longer wanting to make another call. There were still so many business partners left to contact, and she had never in her life talked this much in a single day.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Luna knew what she was thinking and quickly stood up to stop her. &quot;Diana, don&#x27;t smash it. I customized this phone for you. Just the components alone cost over two hundred thousand dollars, and the data inside is invaluable. This is a high-end computer-grade smartphone tailored to your needs!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;If you must smash something, smash mine!&quot; She handed her cell phone to Diana.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She knew Diana despised socializing and dealing with people.</p><p style="text-align:left;">That was why she had left the company&#x27;s management to Nolan while she stayed behind the scenes.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana had never been so inconvenienced in her life, and now Steven had put her in this position.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She licked her dry lips, then said angrily, &quot;Luna, Steven must&#x27;ve done this on purpose. Judging by the situation, we&#x27;re pulling an all-nighter tonight.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Luna wasn&#x27;t sure if Steven had done it intentionally, but he had left her with a golden opportunity.</p><p style="text-align:left;">There&#x27;s no such thing as a free lunch. Success only comes through hard work.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Luna checked the time. It was dinnertime, and good food could certainly lift Diana&#x27;s spirits.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Diana, I&#x27;ll stay with you tonight. Nolan will come over later. What would you like to eat? I&#x27;ll have him bring it.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana thought for a moment. She needed to eat well to have the energy to work and to maintain a good mood. &quot;Let&#x27;s have a seafood feast. Tell him to bring lots of crabs, the ones with plenty of crab roe. I want steamed crabs with some mustard on the side. I need something to stimulate my brain.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Luna had expected this. Only delicious food could brighten Diana&#x27;s mood.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana added, &quot;Call Joseph and have him join us. He&#x27;ll be working late with us tonight.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Luna smiled, &quot;Okay!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana&#x27;s phone rang. She picked it up and saw it was Alexander. &quot;Alexander.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">His voice was deep and magnetic. &quot;Diana, I heard about your situation. Is it true? Did you... really get the divorce certificate?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana was stunned for a moment. Alexander was calling just to ask about her divorce.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She glanced at the divorce certificate on the table and smiled, &quot;Yes, Alexander, it&#x27;s true.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander said, &quot;Diana, let&#x27;s have dinner tonight to celebrate.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana replied, &quot;Alexander, I have to work late tonight. Tomorrow night, I&#x27;ll be attending a banquet hosted by Leones. How about the day after tomorrow?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander chuckled softly, &quot;Diana, the day after tomorrow is Christmas Eve. Are you planning to spend it with me?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana had completely forgotten about it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She responded, &quot;Alexander, let&#x27;s reschedule. I know you&#x27;ll want to spend Christmas with your parents. Let&#x27;s meet on the second day of Christmas.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander said, &quot;Alright. I&#x27;ve sent you a gift. It should arrive at the Gellar Group soon.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana thanked him. &quot;Thank you, Gale.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">His voice became even gentler. &quot;Diana, there&#x27;s no need for thanks between us.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana smiled and hung up the phone.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After hanging up, a call came from the front desk a few minutes later. Diana knew it was about Alexander&#x27;s gift and asked Luna to retrieve it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Ten minutes later, Luna returned with the gift.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana opened the exquisite box and saw a dazzling diamond necklace inside.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Luna was stunned. &quot;Diana, isn&#x27;t this the Star of Splendor from last month&#x27;s jewelry magazine cover? This set is worth three billion dollars!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana was puzzled. &quot;Why would he give me such an expensive gift?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Luna said, &quot;Maybe it&#x27;s to congratulate you on acquiring Gellar Group or to celebrate your divorce!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana blinked. &quot;Divorce is worth celebrating?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Luna explained, &quot;Diana, ending an unhappy marriage is something worth celebrating.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana agreed, but the gift was far too extravagant.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;This... what if it feels burdensome?&quot; Diana imagined herself walking around with this necklace and joked about how it might strain her neck.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Luna was speechless.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Three billion dollars were indeed too much!</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana decided against keeping it. &quot;Luna, help me figure out how to return it.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Luna was stunned and stared blankly at Diana. &quot;Diana, why would you want to return it? You&#x27;re divorced from Steven now. I think Mr. Powell might be your Mr. Right.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana laughed in exasperation. Looking at Luna&#x27;s hopeful expression, she took a deep breath. &quot;Luna, I just got out of a relationship...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Luna interrupted her, &quot;Diana, the best way to move on from a relationship is to start a new one. I think he would be a great man for you!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Besides, Mr. Edward Gellar also hopes that you and Mr. Powell will be together. He often asks me for information about you and Mr. Powell.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana blinked. &quot;When? Why didn&#x27;t you ever tell me?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="924.html">« Prev</a><a href="926.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
