She could tell he was on the verge of losing control. It was a sure sign of his intense anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did things go on the island, Diana?" Alexander asked with a warm smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana met his concerned gaze and smiled back. "It went very well. I only came back after everything was settled. Althea had a lovely baby boy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's wonderful! From now on, I'll keep looking after you. Tobias calls me every day, worried that someone might be giving you a hard time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wasn't exaggerating. Tobias did call him daily, reminding him to take care of Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Alexander had already assured him, Tobias still seemed a bit uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled gently. "Tobias really cares about me. Thank you, Alexander, for not minding the disturbance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not at all. He's been busy with projects abroad, and it just so happens we're collaborating. He's handling things on that end, while I'm pushing them forward over here. It's been going great. We chat about work every night, and it's actually kind of nice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's calm, soothing tone left a favorable impression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the waiter brought over the rib casseroles. Diana's eyes lit up the moment she saw them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd been eating seafood on the island for so long that she was craving ribs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow! They smell amazing!" Diana took a bite, and the taste delighted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her enjoy the meal, Alexander smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, have some more. You've lost weight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He placed a few more ribs on her plate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Alexander! I really love these."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go on, eat as much as you want," he said, still smiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After enjoying a few ribs, Diana said, "Alexander, I have an AI medical system that I've been developing for the past two years. Next, Micah and I are going to organize a research team, and in about six months, we'll be ready to bring it to market. Would you be interested in partnering with us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was taken aback by her talent. "Diana, how are you so incredibly gifted?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana paused for a moment, then smiled. "If you're willing to collaborate, I won't have to worry about seeking investors or partners."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been working on this system with Micah's team for two years. Some things came up before, which delayed the project, but recently, I've been back at it again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you have time in the next six months, you could join our research team. What I need are your resources. For now, I'm not lacking in development funds."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In six months, there will be a business conference with an opportunity for a commercial presentation. I was hoping I could count on your support then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew how valuable Alexander's resources were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana handed him a USB drive. "Alexander, this has all the information. Take your time to go through it. There's still half a year, so you can decide then. No rush."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know your company is involved in this field, so there's no pressure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled. "Diana, I'm not feeling pressured. I know how talented you are. Your designs sell incredibly well in our live streams. Our viewership used to be modest, but now the daily sales are beyond what you can imagine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go ahead, give me the drive. I'll take a good look at it. I'd be delighted to collaborate with you." He felt a surge of excitement at the thought of building a future together with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was just about to hand over the USB drive when a large hand intercepted it midway.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="586.html">« Prev</a><a href="588.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
