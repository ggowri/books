"No way&mdash;I'm worried you might have something!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven growled through clenched teeth. "Diana, I'm clean!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether you're clean or not has nothing to do with me!" Diana feigned calmness.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She won't let him see her panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Has everything to do with it! You've always been avoiding me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was furious, wishing he could just shake her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled brightly, "So you know I was avoiding you? Then keep your distance."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tried to walk away but found his grip on her wrist tightening.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you let go?" Diana complained, feeling his hot palm against her skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven furrowed his brow. "Where are you going?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My phone and clothes are with Althea. I need to find her. You dragged me away in angry. They'll worry about me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you're not worried about me being angry?" Steven gazed intensely at her, as if he might miss any flicker of her expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn't help but laugh. "I don't understand why you're angry! I waited for you at home like a good girl before, and you treated me like air. Now I go out to have some fun, and you're angry again? It seems like whatever I do is wrong in your eyes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt utterly helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they were together, they never had anything meaningful to discuss; they only revisited past arguments.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want to waste time with a man like him. Although she loved the melancholy and selfish Steven very much, she didn't want to be tangled up like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had lost her heart and felt indifferent. She couldn't control her feelings, no matter how it hurt or was misused.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet she could keep these feelings hidden in her heart&mdash;if she didn't touch it, it wouldn't hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven stared at her deeply and suddenly tempered his anger. "It's my fault!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana froze. Was Steven admitting he was wrong!?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt lost for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was surprising!</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven admitted his mistake!</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was taken aback. "Steven, how can you be wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry." Steven looked at her sincerely, his usual arrogance gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was utterly unprepared for this.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was genuinely apologizing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart skipped a beat!</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Steven she knew was proud and wouldn't bow to anyone, not even his troublesome father.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only people he respected were his grandparents.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, here he was, apologizing to her&mdash;it was shocking.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "It's fine. Just let it go..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you can't let it go; you keep bringing it up..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mentioning the past ignited Diana's temper. "If I don't bring up the past, what can I talk about? There's no future for us, so I have to bring up what happened before. If only you'd agree to a peaceful separation, a divorce, it wouldn't be so hard to move on.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why can't we just divorce?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn't understand why he was still clinging to her if he didn't love her!</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven knew she was trapped in her own loop, wanting to escape him to avoid confronting the pain of their past.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But could she really forget that pain?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, she couldn't!</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been in the depths of despair, knowing how terrifying that sense of hopelessness was.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he wouldn't let her suffer alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sit down. I won't force you. In this year, I won't touch you without your permission."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="784.html">« Prev</a><a href="786.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
