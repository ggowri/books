Don't you know a police officer? Report it quickly. Only someone we know can remain fair."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The things she developed must never be stolen by others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven replied, "Alright! Don't worry. I'll call right away."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana picked up her phone and quickly sent him the address.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've sent you the address. Forward it to your police friend."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven saw her anxiousness, made the call, and sent the address to the other party.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, let's go."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven pulled her downstairs and brought out her favorite shoes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked Diana to change her shoes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana watched his thoughtful actions and felt he was truly gentle. During this time, she had always been pampered by Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven would call Leopold every night and also go back with her to accompany Leopold for dinner.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven developed feelings and became a normal person.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They went straight to the garage to drive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Twenty minutes later, Diana and Steven met Tom and Joseph in the club's private room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana." Joseph saw Diana and smiled happily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Joseph greeted Steven coldly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven noticed his attitude but didn't mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Joseph had been hostile to him from the start, but Steven thought as long as he stayed loyal to Diana, it was enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled, "We also brought the police."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tom said, "These two chose to meet at the club, probably not for a deal. They're currently in a relationship."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana asked in confusion, "Joseph, who is the traitor in the lab?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Joseph felt annoyed whenever he thought of the vain Chloe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Chloe."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is it really her? No wonder she got so emotional about the special medicine."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana curiously asked, "Who is Chloe's lover?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tom sneered and said, "It's Mario. Joseph found out she recently started wearing designer brands, living in a mansion, and driving luxury cars, so he focused on her and saw her with Mario."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She was deceived by Mario. Her life was ruined just like that."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana didn&rsquo;t sympathize with Chloe. She was greedy and ruined her own future.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "I hate thieves the most, and I hate betrayal the most. Tom, back then, you brought her into the lab because she was hardworking and eager to learn. You gave her a chance, but she was the one who was vain and couldn&rsquo;t resist temptation."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at Tom. She knew Tom was kind and would surely blame himself. She said, "Tom, she betrayed you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tom felt guilty. Chloe was his student. "Actually, at this point, I don&rsquo;t feel it&rsquo;s a pity. She wasn&rsquo;t that outstanding to begin with. I gave her a chance because she was hardworking and diligent. She&rsquo;s the one who didn&rsquo;t seize it. I don&rsquo;t feel guilty anymore."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Joseph suddenly said, "Diana, Professor Cullen, they&rsquo;ve started."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at Steven and said, "Take the police in."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at Joseph and said, "Joseph, bring your evidence, let&rsquo;s go in together."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Joseph nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario, Chloe, and the buyer were all there.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie, eager to succeed, quickly found a buyer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the three were discussing the price, Steven walked in with his group.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe saw Steven and his group and got scared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't know how they came.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Professor Cullen, Ms. Bishop, what are you..." Chloe asked, trembling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario immediately had a bad feeling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glared at them, very worried.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tom said coldly, "Chloe, you really disappoint me. You had a great opportunity, yet you became a thief."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe's ears buzzed, and she felt terrified.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario stood up abruptly and firmly said, "This is my private room. Please leave and don't disturb our work."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana pointed at her computer and said, "But my computer is in your hands. Where do you want us to go?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario looked at the computer in his hands, which he had grabbed in anger when he stood up, and felt helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, there are so many identical computers in the world. How can you be sure this one is yours?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled, "My belongings always have a mark. I like blue, so the laptop's cover is also blue. Under the cover, there's a small label with the initials of my name and Steven's. Back then, I thought he belonged to me too, so all my things carried his mark."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven suddenly looked at her and held her hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Joseph looked at their joined hands, feeling displeased. But as long as she was happy, he could be content.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven felt deeply guilty. Over the years, he had made Diana endure too much pain alone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From now on, he would never let that happen again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He silently vowed in his heart never to let her suffer alone again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario was at a loss at that moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at Mario without speaking and smiled, "Mario, why don't you peel off that computer screen protector and see if the letters I mentioned are on it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario looked at her coldly and said, "I don't know what you're talking about. Leave, and don't disturb our work."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario held firm, believing that if Diana had no evidence, she couldn't do anything to them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana instead looked at Chloe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe was dressed in an elegant gown, looking regal and graceful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She avoided Diana's icy gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She lowered her head, standing close to Mario. Mario was her only support now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana walked toward Chloe, sizing her up, and finally said calmly, "Chloe, in my lab, you could actually have a great future."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With Tom, you'll have a bright future. Joseph's life will keep getting better."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He's 19 this year, earning a million dollars annually. Chloe, if you stick with it for two more years, you'll achieve the same. Your life will also keep getting better."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe looked into Diana's clear eyes and cried.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1159.html">« Prev</a><a href="1161.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
