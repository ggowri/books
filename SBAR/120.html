He said that you also know about this matter, and you will get him out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Steven, I'm not bothering you anymore, why don't you let me go?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I've already divorced you without hesitation. I've taken good care of you for two years. Why don&rsquo;t you let me go? Do you want to destroy me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana hung up the phone after saying that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then she blocked the number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Steven tried to call her, he found that he was blocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Damn it, Diana blocked me again..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven was furious and looked gloomy, saying, "Evan, come in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He yelled towards the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan was shocked and wondered who had offended his boss. He was about to collapse in recent times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven came back from the island like a different person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan came in when Steven's cell phone rang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven answered the phone, it was Gale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As soon as the call was connected, Gale said, "Steven, you have to help me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven already knew what happened to Diana, so he called Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now hearing Gale's words, his eyes narrowed slightly and instantly became sharp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"How can I help you?" he knew what Gale meant and said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale was not afraid to let Steven know it because they were on the same side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Steven, I wanted Harry and the others to stop Diana and teach her a lesson. Last time, she made Queenie unhappy, Queenie had been depressed for the past few days, but Diana didn't go back to apologize to Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I thought that after I taught her a lesson today, she would go back and apologize, but I didn't expect that they went a little too far and wanted to rape Diana. Now they have all been arrested by the police."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Steven, we're friends, please help rescue them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven looked cold and grim, saying, "Gale, are you still a human being? Because Queenie was unhappy, you found someone to destroy Diana?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The cold and angry voice made Gale shudder even through the screen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Steven, I wanted to teach her a lesson and make her divorce you sooner. Haven't you always liked Queenie? I'm doing this for your own good. You have to help me with this matter."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven closed his eyes. So this was how they bullied Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">How painful her heart would be?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Gale, you are such a fucking idiot. There is evidence for most of the things Queenie did, but you turned a blind eye and repeatedly hurt Diana?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You did some of those things together with Queenie. Do you want to pretend that you don't know?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Also, Diana is my wife. If you hurt her, you are provoking me. I will not bail them. I will keep them in jail forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Go back and tell Queenie&hellip;"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="119.html">« Prev</a><a href="121.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
