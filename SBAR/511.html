It was under my uncle's name before. But then, it was under my name. It was done by my father. I don't know what my father was going to do. My uncle may not know that the land is now under my name."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well!" Diana raised her eyebrows and smiled happily, "I called you before. Wyatt wanted to give me this piece of land so that I could release Samuel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was nervous. He had been plotted against recently. It made him feel anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was wearing a white jacket and light-colored jeans, looking noble and elegant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil asked worriedly, "Diana, what are you going to do? Are you really going to let him go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "Letting him go isn't a bad thing. Even if we let him go, he will still commit crimes with his impulsive temper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But he mentioned the land in the western suburbs. It reminded me of something. There is an ancient tomb under it. It can't be developed. Whoever buys it will be unlucky. That's why I asked you to sell it to Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie also wants to buy lands and enter the real estate industry. I purchased Elroy's land before. They also liked it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, they want to buy the land in the western suburbs. If I'm not mistaken, in half a month, the government will participate in the development of the western suburbs. And that land will also be included in the planning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't lie to you. It's better to sell it as soon as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil widened his eyes in shock. "Diana, what on earth has happened to my family? Why is everything going so wrong?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are there traps everywhere?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, "Cecil, in this world, bad people are too bad, and there are very few people who have no bad thoughts. As long as you are not blind, they can't hurt you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil asked in shock, "Diana, how do you know there is an ancient tomb below?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, "I have learned about the history and asked Olivia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that Cecil believed Olivia's words because Olivia had saved his father's life last time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, isn't Olivia coming back yet? If she comes back, I want to ask her to help my family. It's too terrible. Everything is full of calculations."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil couldn't sleep well now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was awakened by nightmares every night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Speaking of nightmares, Cecil was shocked. "Diana, I often had nightmares recently. I dreamed that a woman cut off my hands and feet and threw them into the sea to feed the fish."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said, "This is just a psychological effect. Don't think too much about it. You will be fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "I will not let anything happen to Cecil. He is my greatest ally."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cecil, everything is going well now. Your father is fine, and you will be fine, too. Your grandmother is in good health, and your mother is very happy. Your sister is doing well abroad as well. Everything is fine with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the only way Diana could comfort Cecil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew the result but not the process. She didn't know what had happened between Cecil and Queenie in her previous life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil frowned. He didn't feel that way. In his dream, he was in great pain. He also heard a woman's vicious voice. "Cecil, you idiot. Everything in the Farley family is mine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That voice was very vicious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil shook his head uncomfortably. He thought, "Perhaps I'm really overthinking." Then, he said, "Diana, I see. We will all be fine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tell Queenie that I will auction off the land you just mentioned. Anyway, I want her to buy the land at the highest price and end up with nothing."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="510.html">« Prev</a><a href="512.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
