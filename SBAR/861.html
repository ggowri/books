She even considered giving their child to a stranger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were distant. "Carolyn, you don't believe me? Do you really think I'd harm our child?" Sam's voice trembled with fear. He couldn't understand what he'd done wrong for Carolyn to misunderstand him so badly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn forced a cold smile. "Sam, you and Janet aren't siblings. There's something going on between you two. You can't let her go, so why not just marry her? Why hurt me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can choose not to love me, not to marry me, but you can't insult me like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You both have been trying to harm my baby. I've taken every precaution, but you almost succeeded."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was shocked. The story felt all too familiar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I didn't. There's nothing between Janet and me. I've always loved you. Janet has a boyfriend, so why do you keep bringing this up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't like Janet and refused to take the blame for something he didn't do. Where was this coming from?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet had grown up with the Young family and often acted coquettishly around him, but he always kept his distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Carolyn, I know you're pregnant and feeling insecure, which is why you're so worried. I promise I'll find out who poisoned you today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Janet with indifference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet was startled, swallowing nervously. She had taken advantage of Sam's absence to drive a wedge between them, and Carolyn had never dared to speak up before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sam, you... you believe this bitch's lies and not me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bitch?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam's eyes were cold. "Janet, I've tolerated you because you grew up in my family. It seems you've done a lot to hurt Carolyn in secret. You'd better hope I don't find out what you've really done. If I do, you'll regret ever being born."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone who dared to come between him and Carolyn would face his wrath. Carolyn was the wife he had prayed for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet's pupils trembled with fear, and she didn't dare speak or even breathe nervously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Carolyn, enduring intense pain, said, "Sam, the evidence is all on my phone. The photos and videos Janet sent me about you two, the messages where she insulted me&mdash;it's all there. I've given everything to my lawyer. Once I give birth safely, and if I survive, I'll use it to apply for divorce."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam was stunned. Evidence!?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What evidence?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He laughed bitterly, his eyes red. "Carolyn, can't you see how good I've been to you? There's nothing between Janet and me. If there is, it's just the care of an older brother for a younger sister."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop it. Sam, you're such a liar. Is it that hard to admit you like someone else?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at him coldly, fed up with his hypocrisy. If Carolyn hadn't been pregnant and it wasn't winter, she would have left long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana found these words so familiar. Sam reminded her of Steven, who was also a real scumbag.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="860.html">« Prev</a><a href="862.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
