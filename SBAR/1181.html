"Uncle, you're not even holding the gun right. How do you expect to shoot? This thing packs a punch&mdash;the recoil will hurt your hand when you fire. You might end up hurting yourself. You can't hold a gun like that."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana showed no fear, her clear eyes meeting his directly. Sure, she was scared with the barrel pressed against her forehead. Darnell Bishop's eyes flashed with murderous intent. "Shut your mouth, you little brat! If you hadn't come back, all of this would be mine. Your dad sped up cleaning out the Bishop family parasites just to get you home faster."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ha!" Diana burst into delighted laughter. "So you admit you're a parasite?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm not!" Darnell Bishop's killing intent intensified, his emotions running high.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone watched Diana tensely&mdash;she was provoking him. Leopold was sweating bullets. The fate of two generations of Bishop heirs rested on Diana's shoulders. Everyone was on edge but didn't dare speak, afraid of setting Darnell Bishop off.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You little brat, you've got a smart mouth. Shut up and don't say another word! If you keep talking, I'll blow your brains out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana flinched, putting on a scared act. "Oh no! I'm so scared. But even if you get the whole Bishop family and kill me too, do you really think you're walking out of here today?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My three brothers control your overseas business, and we control all the domestic operations. The entire Bishop family belongs to my dad now. What can you do besides play hero here? If you put the gun down, I'll have my dad spare your life. You'll be comfortable&mdash;how's that sound?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana blinked her pretty eyes playfully.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not interested." Darnell Bishop sneered. He could live comfortably on his own without anyone's charity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You little brat, you really caught me off guard. Your dad wants to give you the Bishop family as your dowry&mdash;did he bother asking if I agreed to that?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darnell Bishop was getting worked up. Diana laughed in disbelief. "My dad just told you&mdash;you're an adopted outsider. I give you food to eat, and you should be grateful. But what did you do? You're nothing but an ungrateful snake."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I... I'm not ungrateful! Your dad wronged me! So what if I'm adopted? Adopted sons can inherit too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darnell Bishop was losing it, on the verge of a breakdown. He hated Diana's sharp tongue. Today, nobody in this room was getting out alive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, no, no." Diana wagged her finger. "You'd inherit from your own father's estate. What's that got to do with my dad? You're not his son. My dad only has one daughter&mdash;me. If he's got assets to pass down, I'm the one who inherits them. What's that got to do with you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darnell Bishop: "..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Copper Bishop smiled. That's his Diana&mdash;well said. These words that he and his brothers couldn't bring themselves to say came naturally from the younger generation. She was absolutely right. Why should his wealth go to an outsider? His assets were all meant as his daughter's dowry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darnell Bishop gave a cold laugh. "You're right&mdash;it's got nothing to do with me. But that's exactly why we're taking it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His smile turned sinister. Yuki Bishop smirked arrogantly. "Diana, nobody's getting out of here today. You'll all be our stepping stones, and all your assets will fall into my hands."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana raised an eyebrow at her. "Confidence is good, but too much confidence becomes arrogance. Arrogant people tend to overestimate their own abilities and worth."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yuki Bishop: "Diana, cut the crap. I'm taking what's mine today."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled. "Oh really? And how exactly are you gonna do that? With daddy's little gun there? Look at you - your legs are shaking so bad you can barely hold the damn thing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darnell Bishop snapped. "Shut your mouth, you little bitch! Don't test me - I'll put a bullet in you right now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, you won't. Time to close the door and let the dogs loose." Diana shot to her feet. Steven immediately stood with her, pulling her protectively into his arms. Copper Bishop watched his daughter finish her game, then spoke calmly: "Butler, lock the doors. Time to deal with the rats."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, sir."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The heavy carved doors slammed shut with a resounding thud. Darnell Bishop flinched, his gun hand trembling even more violently. "What the hell do you mean, 'let the dogs loose'?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fear crept into Darnell's voice. He knew he had nothing left - he was at the end of his rope. Copper Bishop had been systematically destroying his company to secure his daughter's happiness, and Darnell knew it. He just couldn't accept defeat, couldn't swallow the bitter pill of failure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, armed security poured down the staircase, surrounding them in the grand hall. Darnell's cloudy eyes widened in terror. "Tobias, you bastard. You had this whole thing planned out, didn't you? Just waiting to spring your trap."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Copper Bishop nodded slightly. "Darnell, I never wanted to destroy you completely. But your greed got the better of you. All these years I've been trying to bring my daughter home, and today you three show up here causing trouble. I'm done being patient."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But Copper, everyone knows the Bishop Manor should be mine! Now it's going to some bastard child you had on the side - what does that make me look like?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yuki Bishop wasn't giving up. Even facing certain defeat, she'd cling to any shred of hope. Copper Bishop's gaze turned ice-cold: "Yuki, you've lived in luxury all these years because of your father - my adopted son. You got to enjoy all this because you're his daughter. But you were never the heir to this estate, and you never will be."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My daughter was never illegitimate. I watched her grow up from the day she was born. I kept her away from this family's bloodshed because I didn't want her to see the dirty games you people play. I wanted her to have a normal, happy childhood."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt tears well up at her father's words. The people who truly loved her would always love her, no matter what. "Dad." She stood and walked over, wrapping her arms around his. She could feel his love - there was nothing awkward about it at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Copper Bishop's expression softened, his eyes glistening with unshed tears. His daughter looked just like him in his youth. Just looking at her filled his heart with overwhelming happiness. "Diana, from now on, Daddy's never leaving you again. You'll never be alone. I'll stay right here with you until you have children of your own. Let me take care of you, okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nodded eagerly. "Yes, Dad. I want to spend more time with you too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Copper Bishop turned to Steven, his tone becoming distant again. "Steven, your parents can handle the company. Are you willing to stay here with Diana?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1180.html">« Prev</a><a href="1182.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
