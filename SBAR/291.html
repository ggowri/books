She grew up in the countryside. Do you think she really knows design?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you really want a designer, I can recommend someone to you. Elsie Hadley, my fianc&eacute;e, is a designer. She has won an award before."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana had intense hatred in her eyes, but she didn't say anything because she knew Nolan was even more sharp-tongued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nolan looked at Frank coldly and snorted, "Firstly, Diana grew up with me. She didn't become a designer by seducing me. I begged her to come back and be a designer in my company. Secondly, you said that she grew up in the countryside, but you don't know that she graduated from a top foreign university as a top student with multiple degrees. When she came back to your family, she had completed all her studies. She skipped grades and graduated early, but you thought she didn't go to college. She is excellent, and you, who spent money to study at a third-rate university, can never match her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thirdly, I know your fianc&eacute;e, Elsie Hadley. I was a judge in that competition. You can take her designs to solicit investment and see if anyone is willing to invest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was stunned, thinking, "How could this be? Diana was in the countryside when Gale went to pick her up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I still remember Diana dressed very poorly when she came back. How could it be possible that she had completed all her studies at that time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank didn't believe Nolan. "Humph! Mr. Watson, why do you have to belittle my fianc&eacute;e to protect Diana? My fianc&eacute;e has never offended you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Besides, if Diana is really as excellent as you say, why has she relied on Steven all these years?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Nolan heard the name "Steven", his face turned livid, and he exuded an imposing presence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nolan said coldly, "Steven had been disabled and blind. Diana wasted a few years taking care of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie, as his future wife, can only enjoy the good times with him. Diana helped you maintain the relationship between the two families, but what did she get in the end? And you, as her brother, even insulted her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Frank, regarding your defamation of Diana a few days ago, I will sue you. See you next time in court."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying that, Nolan took Diana away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana didn't even look at Frank all the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige slammed the office door, not wanting to see Frank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The door closed, and Frank looked extremely embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was angry, not believing what Nolan said at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank thought, "Back then, Steven was in such a terrible state, but Diana was still willing to marry him and take care of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie has never suffered since her childhood. How could we let her marry Steven and take care of the disabled man?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's a blessing for Diana to be Steven's wife for a few years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Besides, Steven's mother didn't accept Queenie, so it's not Queenie's fault."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank returned to the company in a rage. Then, he ordered the public relations department to retouch pictures to slander Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not long after, the pictures of Diana with men were posted on the Internet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All the men's faces were blurred, but Diana's face was shown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many netizens started cursing Diana for being lubricious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Diana returned to the office, Luna entered angrily. "Diana, Frank has gone too far!"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="290.html">« Prev</a><a href="292.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
