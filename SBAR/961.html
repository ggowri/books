Only when something happened to Steven would the man who looked like him be able to replace him.</p><p>Diana figured it all out.</p><p>She couldn&#x27;t help but admire herself. Even at a time like this, she could still smile.</p><p>Queenie didn&#x27;t answer directly. She wouldn&#x27;t make the mistake of telling Diana she was behind everything like she used to.</p><p>Diana was different now.</p><p>Queenie yelled, &quot;Diana, if you don&#x27;t let me have a good Christmas, then don&#x27;t expect to have one either.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So, what do you want to do to me?&quot; Diana scoffed. &quot;Queenie, there&#x27;s nothing left that can threaten me now.&quot;</p><p>She picked up a shrimp and slowly took a bite. The fresh, tender meat made her eyes narrow with joy.</p><p>Even though Leopold and her brothers weren&#x27;t around this year, she was still having a good time.</p><p>Queenie screamed into the phone, &quot;Diana, I want you dead.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh,&quot; Diana replied calmly.</p><p>Her indifferent attitude only made Queenie even angrier.</p><p>She couldn&#x27;t understand why Diana had suddenly become so fearless.</p><p>Queenie couldn&#x27;t believe how amazing Diana had become.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;ll make you wish you were dead, Diana.&quot; Queenie hung up the phone.</p><p>It was Christmas, and Diana wasn&#x27;t in the mood for a fight.</p><p>Queenie&#x27;s extreme behavior must have been triggered by something.</p><p>Diana turned to Luna. &quot;Luna, find out what happened to Queenie tomorrow. She&#x27;s throwing a tantrum.&quot;</p><p>Luna had already received the news. She smirked. &quot;Diana, I got the news already. Queenie and Mr. Gellar got beaten up. Both were sent to the hospital. Mr. Gellar is still unconscious, and Queenie is in a wheelchair.&quot;</p><p>Diana was surprised.</p><p>She wondered who did such a good deed.</p><p>It was such a pleasant surprise.</p><p>She glanced down at her feet, and for some reason, she felt the revenge wasn&#x27;t so bad after all.</p><p>Diana laughed uncontrollably.</p><p>Luna felt helpless. &quot;Diana, come on. You&#x27;ve been bullied by her for years, and now you&#x27;re this happy just because she got a little bit of karma?&quot;</p><p>She didn&#x27;t know how Diana had endured those years.</p><p>Diana said, &quot;Luna, you got it wrong. Those who can control their emotions and not show it are no ordinary people. I&#x27;m no ordinary woman. The loud ones? They usually don&#x27;t have any real skills. I&#x27;m the type who keeps quiet, has sharp eyes, and gets things done.&quot;</p><p>Luna, Nolan, Nick, and Barry stared at her, bewildered.</p><p>That was a big boast.</p><p>Diana noticed their confused gazes and felt a little awkward.</p><p>She frowned. &quot;So, do you all think I&#x27;m dumb?&quot;</p><p>They nodded at the same time.</p><p>Diana was speechless.</p><p>Luna shook her head. &quot;Diana, you&#x27;re not dumb. You&#x27;re just a love-struck fool. Without Steven, you&#x27;re pretty and rich.&quot;</p><p>Diana snorted, &quot;Stop with the sarcasm. Back then, I had my reasons. But now that everything&#x27;s clear, I&#x27;m not holding onto it anymore. Do you think I&#x27;d keep tolerating it?</p><p>&quot;Let&#x27;s eat, celebrate Christmas, and after we clean up, let&#x27;s play poker. I haven&#x27;t played in years. Let&#x27;s stay up late.&quot;</p><p>Diana felt she was being very sincere.</p><p>In the past, she&#x27;d been waiting on Steven, hoping for warmth that would never come.</p><p>Now she wasn&#x27;t so foolish.</p><p>Family and love could not be forced.</p><p>People should learn to accept fate.</p><p>Luna was excited when she saw the cards she had drawn.</p><p>Her dimples showed as she said, &quot;Nolan, you all better eat up. Once we&#x27;re done, let&#x27;s get started. I&#x27;m going to make a lot of money.&quot;</p><p>Diana almost always lost when she gambled.</p><p>It was fun.</p><p>Luna placed a whole fish into her bowl and laughed joyfully. &quot;Happy Christmas!&quot;</p><p>Nolan and the others couldn&#x27;t help but laugh at her antics.</p><p>&quot;Here you go. There&#x27;s more in the pot. Take as much as you want, as long as you&#x27;re not worried about getting full,&quot; Nolan said indulgently.</p><p>They grew up together, and to him, Luna was like a little sister.</p><p>Luna grinned, &quot;I&#x27;m not that greedy. One fish is enough. Every year&#x27;s surplus, and everyone shares. I wish for you three to each find a beautiful wife and have three kids next year.&quot;</p><p>Nolan and the others were taken aback.</p><p>But they were happy to hear it.</p><p>Diana glanced at the three handsome men.</p><p>She said, &quot;Look at you guys. You&#x27;re so handsome. By your age, others already have kids, yet here you are, still single. Next year, work hard and try to get married early. As Luna said, have three kids in a year.</p><p>&quot;You&#x27;ve been with me all these years, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about a house. I&#x27;ll make sure your wives live happily.&quot;</p><p>Nolan and the others couldn&#x27;t help but laugh.</p><p>Nick was the most bashful. &quot;Ms. Bishop, it&#x27;s our job to make our wives happy.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nick, you&#x27;re only two years older than me. I&#x27;m technically your little sister. I was planning to split up the houses for you, but since I&#x27;ve been away, I&#x27;ll do it after Christmas. Even if you don&#x27;t need the money, it&#x27;s the promise I made to you,&quot; Diana insisted.</p><p>Nolan and the others were all pleased. After all, no one ever complained about having more houses.</p><p>They were all orphans, taken in by Leopold and trained into talents. They were deeply grateful and lived with a heart full of appreciation.</p><p>&quot;Thanks, Ms. Bishop.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thanks, Ms. Bishop.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thanks, Diana.&quot;</p><p>Diana pointed to the table full of delicious food. &quot;Hurry up and eat. Afterward, I&#x27;ll give you gifts, and we&#x27;ll play poker together.&quot;</p><p>They couldn&#x27;t help but laugh joyfully.</p><p>Everything was harmonious and full of happiness.</p><p>Meanwhile, Steven and Evan were both unwell and not feeling like eating anything.</p><p>But when they saw Diana and Luna on the surveillance, they both smiled. Evan, seeing the warm and harmonious scene, suddenly felt that everyone around Diana must be very happy.</p><p>He looked at Nolan, his confusion deepening.</p><p>He took a bite of beef and looked up to see Steven&#x27;s smile. &quot;Mr. Gellar, why do all of them seem to respect Mrs. Gellar so much?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="960.html">« Prev</a><a href="962.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
