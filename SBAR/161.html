She went there with Alexander."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan went to check immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's cell phone rang. He picked it up and saw it was Gale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Hello!" He said with anger in his tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale didn't care. In his mind, Stevenn had always cared about Queenie the most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Steven, why didn't you come to see Queenie? She has been waiting for you and has been calling your name."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven frowned. "I've said it before. I've made it very clear last time at your house. I won't be involved in the affairs of Queenie and the Marsh family anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hearing this, Gale said angrily, "Steven, what's wrong with you? The person you wanted to marry was Queenie. Why did you suddenly ignore her? If you don't care about her, she will give up her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Did Diana say something? Don't believe her. Diana is a liar."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Should I believe you? You hired someone to deal with my wife, and I haven't settled the score with you yet. Diana is right. They don't tell me about what you did because there is a bigger conspiracy waiting for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Hmph! They didn't tell anyone about me because they value the brotherly relationship between us." Gale yelled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven hung up the phone directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He put his cell phone on the desk and sat lazily on the sofa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He remembered Diana's words in his mind. "Someone who has you in his or her heart has time 24 hours a day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the past, whenever Steven came home, Diana would wait for him at home and make him soothing drinks or midnight snacks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana kept the house in good order.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As for his mother, he knew it was not Diana's fault.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His mother was indeed poisoned by someone, but it was not Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana made oatmeal for him and added stomach-nourishing herbs to it. She had shown him what kind of herbs they were.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven went to Diana angrily, hoping to find a reason to see her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven thought, "Queenie was the biggest suspect now. She was abroad, so how did she get the video?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The servants would not come over when Diana was alone at home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Who took my photo?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan came in and said, "Mr. Gellar, Ms. Bishop is at Landing Restaurant."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven frowned and looked at him. "Why don't you call Diana Mrs. Gellar?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He seemed to have answered this question before. Seeing Steven's face, he still told the truth, "Mr. Gellar, didn't you forbid us to call Diana Mrs. Gellar before? You said you were afraid that Ms. Marsh would be unhappy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A hint of hostility flashed across Steven's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Let's go. Call her Mrs. Gellar from now on. It's improper to call Diana Ms. Bishop." He picked up the phone and stood up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan wanted to hit Steven on the back of the head with a hammer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He thought, "How could Steven change so quickly?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It's so hard to be a worker!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven and Evan rushed to Landing Restaurant. Diana and Alexander had already finished their dinner and just came out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alexander opened the car door and held it very gentlemanly to let Diana get in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Steven saw this, his eyes became dark and filled with anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He quickly opened the car door and got out. He walked over quickly and opened the car door. Steven looked at Diana, and said in a cold tone, "Diana, get out of the car."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was a little surprised when he saw Steven suddenly appearing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What are you doing? Get out of the way. I want to go home and rest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had been working intensively these days and must have a good rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven looked at Diana and said, "Come out. We haven't finished talking about the divorce thing today. Don't you want a divorce?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="160.html">« Prev</a><a href="162.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
