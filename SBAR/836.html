Dragging me out on such a cold day to shop while Mark's business is on the brink of collapse?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My hopes are slipping away, and everything seems to be going wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff promised he'd take everything from Paula and hand it over to me but look at him now&mdash;he's got nothing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turn to Mark for support, and he's about to go bankrupt, too. It's like no matter where I turn, I'm hitting a wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is the universe just out to get me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie's thoughts spiraled into a pit of frustration, her heart heavy with resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She understood the tangled web of family interests all too well. Amelie knew her place in this hierarchy&mdash;she had nothing, and now that she was aging, men treated her like a mere distraction, never genuinely caring for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If nothing had changed, if Jeff hadn't divorced Paula and Queenie still had Steven wrapped around her finger, I'd be living the good life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, I can't lose! I have to show Paula that I can live better than her. Look at her now&mdash;she's a lost cause."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Amelie's phone buzzed, and she stepped away to take the call in a quieter spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Jean, feeling defeated after failing to catch up with Lily, turned back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Witnessing the warmth between Lily and Diana made her heart heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anger and disappointment surged within her, a deep sense of loss settling in. Losing Lily felt like a crushing blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not noticing Amelie nearby, Jean glanced in the opposite direction and saw Amelie on the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jean smiled and started to walk over, ready to call out to her. But as soon as she heard Amelie's words, she froze in her tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was on the line with Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, where are you?" Queenie asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where else would I be? Dragged out shopping with that useless Jean. It's freezing, and she insists on buying stuff instead of staying home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That little brat is driving me nuts! If it weren't for her parents' divorce giving me a way out, I wouldn't bother being nice to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But thankfully, her dad's going to be all mine soon, and once I figure out how to kick his kids to the curb, I'll be set."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, this is your choice, and now my movie can't be released because of your mess. We need to figure something out," Queenie replied, frustration bubbling beneath her calm tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie frowned, her irritation mounting. "You should talk to Steven. He's been good to you; he'll help get your movie out there. Look, I'm really stressed right now. I'll think of something later. I need to deal with Jean first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, Amelie turned to find Jean quickly turned away, trying to hide from her gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streamed down Jean's face as she thought, "So that's it. Amelie's kindness was just a ploy to drive a wedge between us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew it deep down but pretended I didn't. How did I let it come to this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I'm sorry!" Jean cried out, determined to chase after Lily once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie spotted her and shouted, "Jean! What do you think you're doing? Get back here and pick out some shoes. After that, we need to go see your dad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wiping her tears away, Jean thought, "Fine, if she wants to play games, let's see who comes out on top."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Amelie, forcing a smile. "Sure thing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie raised an eyebrow, puzzled. "What's going on with you? Why are you crying?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="835.html">« Prev</a><a href="837.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
