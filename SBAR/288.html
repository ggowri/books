In the past two years, something happened to the designer, and the company gradually declined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Paige and her father had always remained optimistic about Aria Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige nodded happily. "Okay, Diana. I will tell my dad when I get home tonight. He will definitely agree. My dad also intended to cooperate with Mr. Watson before, but Mr. Watson never gave him a chance. With you this time, I'm sure the cooperation will be successful."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana knew about this. Back then, she had put all her attention into taking good care of Steven, and she had never produced any design.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now that she was back, and the company was thriving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Frank said sarcastically, "Diana, you are just a designer. What right do you have to decide on Aria Group's affairs? Mr. Watson hasn't decided yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Humph, designer? You came from the countryside. What do you know about design? You are much inferior to Elsie."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana ignored his mocking words, thinking that he was annoying. She squinted at Frank. "Why are you still here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank paused and stared at Diana. "I've been here all the time. Diana, you vicious woman. Did you say something to Paige? She won't attend my wedding."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana thought Frank was unreasonable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige was angry. "You jerk! Frank, why do you always suspect your sister? Diana is vicious? Humph, the real vicious ones are you and your family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You always think you are superior to others? Wake up! Do you know that what you said is like salt on Diana's wounds?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana is a designer. Although she came from the countryside, she is better than you, a graduate of a diploma mill. Your ability is inferior to hers. Diana is the design director, and her design impressed Mr. Powell. She managed to make a cooperation with Mr. Powell. You are the last one who is qualified to criticize Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You enjoy a wealthy life, but you don't care about your own sister."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying that, Paige pointed at Elsie and said, "Thanks to Elsie, her shameful life made me find out that you two are the same type.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Elsie, do you think no one knows your dirty deeds? I have already found out, so you'd better not offend me, or I will give you a big surprise at your wedding."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie panicked. "Paige, you are framing me for not being able to get the love you want. Yes, I have a terrible life. My parents didn't love me. But you are a wealthy lady and can get whatever you want easily. Everything I have now was earned by myself. What qualifications do you have to criticize me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Elsie spoke, she started crying and leaned in Frank's arms, feeling aggrieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana rolled her eyes at Elsie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige was surprised by Elsie's impudent accusation, thinking Elsie was really cheeky.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige sneered, "Well, Elsie. Since you said this, I should really do something. I won't let you down. At your wedding, I will give you a surprise. Just wait."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="287.html">« Prev</a><a href="289.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
