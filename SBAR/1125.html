How dare he say such hypocritical things?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Was he just pretending with Queenie all along?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yanson had known Steven for years, yet he still couldn't figure him out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yanson only knew the general outline of things; the details remained a mystery to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had always believed Steven truly cared for Queenie; otherwise, Yanson wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t have treated Diana that way.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every time Diana was bullied, she just swallowed her pride. Over time, everyone began to see her as an easy target.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>People's cruelty grows when others keep backing down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Yanson didn</span><span>'</span><span>t dare say anything. He</span><span>'</span><span>d always disliked Diana for being such a pushover. Steven didn</span><span>'</span><span>t care about her either, so Yanson never treated her as a friend.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Diana stepped up to help him in his time of need, he was genuinely surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven and George were eerily alike in some ways. Yanson felt he didn</span><span>'</span><span>t even deserve to be Steven</span><span>'</span><span>s friend.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yanson stayed silent, and neither Diana nor Steven said a word.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The atmosphere felt heavy. Of course, Yanson was the only one who felt that way.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie</span><span>'</span><span>s overseas account suddenly showed irregularities, making her even more anxious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie stared intently at the data on her computer, her anxiety growing by the second.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario stood nearby and asked, "Queenie, what's wrong?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie frowned in confusion. "That money should've been transferred overseas by now. Why hasn</span><span>'</span><span>t it arrived yet?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario chuckled, trying to calm her. "It</span><span>'</span><span>s a big amount, so it</span><span>'</span><span>ll take time. Don</span><span>'</span><span>t worry. That money</span><span>'</span><span>s ours anyway."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Large sums of money always passed through their offshore shell company</span><span>'</span><span>s account before being funneled back into Queenie</span><span>'</span><span>s account.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was generous, with plenty of people working under her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A faint unease crept into Queenie</span><span>'</span><span>s heart. She had never felt this way before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Something</span><span>'</span><span>s off. I haven</span><span>'</span><span>t felt this uneasy in a long time. Call Sandra and the others&mdash;tell them to leave immediately. We can</span><span>'</span><span>t let anyone catch anything on us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario, however, was in a great mood. "Alright, don</span><span>'</span><span>t worry. I</span><span>'</span><span>ll call them right away."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario dialed Sandra</span><span>'</span><span>s number, instructing them to leave quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whenever Queenie handled things like this, she always made sure to cover her tracks. No one could trace it back to her office.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sandra covered for Queenie, ensuring she wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t end up on the police</span><span>'</span><span>s radar.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But today, Queenie couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t shake off the unease in her heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario hung up the phone and gently reassured her, "Queenie, they</span><span>'</span><span>ve made it out safely."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She picked up her phone, but the payment notification still hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t come through.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Sandra and her crew were caught by the police just as they left the office.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was still incriminating evidence on their computers that they hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t had time to erase.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sandra was stunned when she saw Diana and Steven arrive together.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sandra realized they were already one step too late.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Panic set in&mdash;Sandra was certain Steven would come down on them hard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sandra struggled briefly, only to be met with a cold warning from the officer, "Ma</span><span>'</span><span>am, stop resisting."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stepped forward, glanced at the program on the computer, and told the officers, "They're the ones who used tech to siphon money from Yanson's company."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sandra glared at Diana and snapped, "Diana, you're lying! This is just my studio. Why would I steal anyone's money?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sandra lacked Felicity's composure and resolve, blurting out words she instantly regretted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smirked at her and said, "Who are you? And how do you know my name?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sandra's companions glared at her back with visible displeasure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man kicked Sandra hard and barked, "Sandra, shut up."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sandra winced in pain. If the officer hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t been holding her, she would</span><span>'</span><span>ve collapsed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She lowered her head in agony, frustrated that she could no longer use that money.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How did Diana find this place?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How did that bitch see right through what I was doing?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie clearly said Diana was just a clueless bumpkin."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The seasoned officers went in to investigate and quickly secured the evidence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sandra felt utterly desperate. She snapped her head up, glaring furiously at Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sandra," Diana called her name directly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sandra asked in surprise, "You know me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked down at her with a cold smirk. "You're Queenie's accomplice. Of course, I know you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What...?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana leaned in close to Sandra's ear, her voice a chilling whisper. "Queenie won't save you. Felicity was already her pawn, and you're next. If you want to see your mom again, confess. With charges this big, Queenie</span><span>'</span><span>s looking at serious time. But you? You might just get a few years and a chance to reunite with your family."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sandra let out a cold laugh. "Don't try to mislead me. I have no idea what you're talking about."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana frowned at her, saying nothing more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie must have made Sandra false promises when she got her to do these things.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sandra would never betray Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had underestimated Queenie's talent for manipulation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yanson was deeply worried about his money. With it, his company could avoid going under.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stepped closer to Diana and cautiously asked, "Diana, can I still get my money back?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana let out a cold laugh and said, "Yes. If Queenie doesn</span><span>'</span><span>t get your money, it</span><span>'</span><span>ll be returned to you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's words were meant for Sandra to hear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sure enough, Sandra snapped her head toward Diana, her face filled with disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana didn</span><span>'</span><span>t say a word; she simply smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sandra was terrified. Diana's smile made her realize she was truly going to prison.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter how cunning Queenie was, she was no match for Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sandra was in a panic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No, Ms. Marsh has been so good to me. I can't betray her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If she comes to help me, I'll be fine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana must have said that on purpose to make me betray Ms. Marsh," Sandra realized.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yanson let out a sigh of relief, then shot Sandra a cold glare.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sandra, if you dare scheme against me, I'll make sure you end up in prison," he said icily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sandra instinctively looked at Yanson and asked, "Why do you even know me?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1124.html">« Prev</a><a href="1126.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
