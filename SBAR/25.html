I just pleaded with Mr. Farley to let you go.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana sneered, &quot;No need. After Madam Farley&#x27;s accident, her bodyguard got a car accident. Quite a coincidence, don&#x27;t you think? It seems that some so-called computer experts couldn&#x27;t even tell whether it was true or false.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie was stunned.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven frowned and asked, &quot;Diana, are you still trying to mess around?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana coldly looked at him and questioned, &quot;Who are you to accuse me of causing trouble?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Diana, you...&quot; Steven stared at the indifference in her eyes, feeling increasingly irritated.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana glanced at Cecil and then scanned the glamorous crowd.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She didn&#x27;t spot Leopold, wondering where he had gone.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Then it clicked in her mind. Perhaps he had hidden away secretly because he didn&#x27;t want to see her being bullied.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Before entering the venue, Diana had asked Olivia to find Leopold and stay with him, assuring her that she could handle things alone here.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Cecil, let&#x27;s get started,&quot; Diana said.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cecil&#x27;s cold eyes became sharp and meaningful. As he looked at her arrogant face, he suddenly wondered how satisfying it would be to inflict pain upon her with his own hands.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He uttered coldly, &quot;Diana, today I&#x27;m going to make your life a living hell.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana responded with a charming smile, &quot;Mr. Farley, do you remember what I said yesterday? I&#x27;ll give back tenfold the slap I got from you.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Everyone couldn&#x27;t tolerate her arrogance.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Diana, you&#x27;re so vicious and arrogant. Do you even realize what will happen to you by coming here today?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Diana, you&#x27;re so wicked. You won&#x27;t even spare an old man. People like you should rot in hell.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">When several girls close to Diana heard her words, they couldn&#x27;t help but stand up and complain, hoping to leave an impression on Cecil.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana glanced coldly at them and remained silent.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She allowed them to scold her, knowing they would soon be embarrassed.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cecil mocked, &quot;Idiot.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Then he made an elegant invitation to Queenie and softly said, &quot;Beautiful Ms. Marsh, please join me on stage.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie took a deep breath. The glory she would obtain at this moment would make her the center of attention in high society, bringing her father continuous support and cooperation.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Even Steven&#x27;s status would rise due to her, making him treat her even better in the future.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana watched Queenie&#x27;s back and smiled.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven caught a glimpse of her smile and was momentarily stunned. Diana appeared completely different and stunning.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In the past, her eyes were always fixated on him wherever he went.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But now, the girl who used to gaze at him with adoration seemed to never want to see him again.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven grew increasingly irritable and took a few steps closer to Diana. Just as he was about to say something, she walked away to the other side.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven paused, watching as Diana looked back at him with a hint of disgust.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It felt as if she was conveying the message, &quot;Stay away from me.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Meanwhile, Cecil enthusiastically introduced, &quot;Thank you all for attending tonight&#x27;s banquet. The beautiful Ms. Queenie Marsh standing next to me saved my grandmother and the entire Farley family.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Everyone knew that Rita held a significant amount of power through her shares.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cecil looked at Diana and said, &quot;Diana, apologize. Once you apologize, I will cut off your hands to make sure you can no longer spread your evil deeds.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana raised an eyebrow and remained motionless.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven frowned, thinking Cecil had gone too far.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Quickly, Queenie intervened, saying, &quot;Mr. Farley, Diana was just careless. Please let her go.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie pleaded loudly for Diana, which earned the favor of everyone present.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Queenie, that&#x27;s enough. I have already made my decision,&quot; Cecil responded before turning his angry gaze towards Diana. &quot;Diana, apologize immediately. Don&#x27;t waste Ms. Marsh&#x27;s time.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie looked at Diana, pretending to be concerned, and was about to speak when a cold voice suddenly came from the door, &quot;Who said Queenie saved me?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="24.html">« Prev</a><a href="26.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
