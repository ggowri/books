It was a crime that could get him up to three years in prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Diana's calculating smirk, Samuel instantly realized why she had provoked him on purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was too late for him to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had deliberately set him up to attack, adding another charge to his case.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With multiple charges now, along with attempted murder, a three-year sentence was unavoidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, one day I'll kill you," he shouted, breaking down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana frowned at him, her fiery red lips curling into a faint, breathtaking smile. Her voice was hauntingly calm as she spoke, "Mr. Farley, I know you are wealthy, but money doesn't mean you can treat lives like they're worthless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel had spent years hanging around with petty thugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all called him "Boss."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This group was skilled at nothing but eating, drinking, partying, gambling, and visiting brothels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Diana turned around gracefully and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Courtney felt dizzy at what she had just witnessed. It seemed they had crossed a madwoman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana deliberately escalated the situation, bringing public scrutiny. Even if Courtney offered a billion, no one would dare to shield her son now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Diana's arrogant smile, Courtney wished she could tear Diana apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana did it on purpose. She provoked her son into assaulting officers, adding another charge to his case.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana cut her off coldly. "Mrs. Farley, are you planning to hurl threats at me in front of the police, too? I'll pretend I didn't hear your previous threats, but I won't accept any settlement. Use whatever means you want. Let the public see your power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Courtney's face twisted in anger as she tried hard to suppress the fury boiling inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never felt such rage in her entire life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was so furious she wanted to destroy the world; the anger burned in her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She used to think people faking fainting from anger was a joke. How could anyone faint from mere rage?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, experiencing it herself, she realized that anger could indeed make one pass out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana watched as Courtney trembled with rage, her eyes cold. Women like her always believed they were superior, never having to worry about money and getting whatever they wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those without status or background were mere ants in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, some people, no matter the cost, never understood the concept of limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana straightened her back and walked past Courtney.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Courtney suddenly realized she couldn't act recklessly with Diana. She took a deep breath, suppressing her anger and murderous intent, and forced a smile at Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, turn off the livestream first. I won't threaten you. Let's sit down and have a proper talk."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="495.html">« Prev</a><a href="497.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
