She treated us as her own family before and has been enduring it all the time. She has even signed the severance agreement, and you still want her to endure it? It's impossible."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jeff said with a cold voice, "It seems that the plan for handling your eldest brother needs to be more ruthless. Get 5% of his shares. I'll think of a way to do the rest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jeff stood in front of the window. He looked ambitiously at the bustling city outside the window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie lowered her head and her eyes were full of malice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Outside the door, Paula recorded their conversation and left again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When she reached the lobby downstairs, she ran into Gale who came rushing over angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mom." Gale's stomach still hurt and his face was pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula was relieved when she saw that Diana didn't come.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She asked weakly, "Did you go to find Diana?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale was very angry. His tone was full of hatred, "I went to find her, but was beaten out by her people."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula smiled. He thought, "Well done. Hope Gale can be smarter."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula forced herself to smile and said, "Gale, come with me to the garden in front. I have something to tell you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale was worried about Queenie. "Mom, I'll go see Queenie first. She must be very sad now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula sneered, "Yes, you care about her so much that you even hurt your own younger sister, but she wants to kill you. Go ahead. I will prepare a coffin for you in advance. Anyway, I know you are stubborn. You only believe in Queenie and will not believe in me although I am your mother."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula looked at his shocked expression and said, "Go ahead. I will choose a good place to bury you. Anyway, your fate is already determined. You are like a bull and cannot be pulled back. I can only prepare for you early."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale said in anger, "Mom, what do you mean? Are you cursing me to death?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula said tearfully, "Has Diana told you not to go anywhere recently?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale sneered, "She told me not to go racing. I have been preparing for three years. How can I not go?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula asked again, "Even if it's life-threatening, you still want to go, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No, Mom, don't listen to Diana's nonsense. I'm wondering if she will plot against me." After Diana told her about this, he was on guard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula's face was pale, and her eyes were filled with killing intentions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She smiled bitterly. "So, what's your thought? She reminded you to be careful, but in the end, you still want to blame her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Gale, do you know that you were in a car accident two years ago? It was Diana who carried you out of the car, so you are still alive today. Although you were not seriously injured, you were knocked unconscious at the time, and your head was squeezed by the airbag. If you were not rescued in time, you would have suffocated to death."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mom, who told you that? The person who saved me that year was Queenie. Diana couldn't even open a racing door. How could she have the ability to save me?" Gale was very angry that Diana had lied to Paula again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula sighed. Gale didn't believe her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mom, you've been deceived by Diana again. Diana is really a liar."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As soon as Gale finished speaking, he was slapped in the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Pah..." A hint of disappointment flashed across Paula's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale was stunned. "Mom, you hit me. You hit me for Diana."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula said weakly, "Go away. You'd better not say a word of what I just said to you in front of Queenie. If you say it, she might commit suicide again to prove that she saved you, and then you will be heartbroken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I won't go there. The company is going bankrupt and I have to work overtime."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula walked away with her head down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale was shocked. He thought, "Is the company going to go bankrupt?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="156.html">« Prev</a><a href="158.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
