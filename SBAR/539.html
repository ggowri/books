Even though she took 3% of the shares, she always feels guilty about it. She would rather owe us nothing, and we can help each other when we can. This is actually quite good. If she doesn't want it, we will find other ways to help her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was shocked to realize that this was how Diana thought. Indeed, he also didn't like owing favors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandma, I see. But now that Wyatt is in the hospital, do you think Queenie might still have more tricks up her sleeve?" He was really worried; Queenie had too many schemes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rita squinted in displeasure as Queenie had crossed the line too far. In the business world, the outcome of each battle was inherently unpredictable. If Queenie were to outdo the Farley family with her own abilities, she would lose with a clear conscience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she insisted on using such underhanded methods, which made her very mad. To deal with a despicable person, Rita had no choice but to become more vile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She won't make a move on the company for now. Their most important goal at the moment is the project in the western suburbs. They will definitely deal with that project first. But if it's true, as Diana said, that there are antiques underneath, then it's uncertain. You need to be prepared to respond at any time," Rita said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about the dream he had, Cecil looked meaningful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandma, I got it." Cecil gave her a reassuring look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rita smiled with relief as Cecil was working hard to grow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was afternoon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula had completed the handover procedures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At six in the afternood, Paula took Linda and Elina out of the company building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula turned to look at the building behind her, feeling very reluctant, but since the buyer wanted it, she sold it. The buyer offered a price of 500 million dollars, so she neither lost nor gained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she still had several other buildings and didn't really care about losing this one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wicked smile curled at the corner of her mouth as she thought, "Queenie, I hope all of your ten billion will go down the drain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Buying an empty company would definitely make her mad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula looked at her two good friends and said with a smile, "Linda, Elina, I'll leave the company matters to you now. I'm going home to deal with some family affairs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Linda said with a smile, "We will take care of the company and consult you on any major decisions. You just have to handle your family affairs well and keep distance from any possible danger, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula nodded with a smile. "Don't worry. I'm invulnerable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Linda and Elina both knew her personality well, so they weren't worried about her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'm heading back now. If there's anything, I'll give you a call." In the wind and snow, Paula still wore a confident smile on her beautiful face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Linda and Elina waved, and Paula got into a taxi by the roadside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far away, in a car, Queenie sat quietly, watching Paula leave the company with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said with a relieved smile, "Mario, this place finally belongs to me. I've been looking forward to this for so many years, and now it's finally mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario smiled, looking at the building not far away with admiration. Ever since Queenie met Steven, her life had become very smooth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Ms. Marsh, you've been planning for so many years, and everything has gone smoothly. From now on, this place is yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right! Tomorrow, you go and tell Felicity to sign the contract with our previous partners, and then have her gather the technical department for a meeting. As long as they work hard, high salaries will be guaranteed," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario said, "Okay, Ms. Marsh, I will notify Felicity immediately and let them prepare early."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie took a deep breath and said in a gentle voice as she was in a good mood, "Now, let's go visit Cecil."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="538.html">« Prev</a><a href="540.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
