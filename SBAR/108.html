He took the USB drive. "Is it about Diana again? Thinking back, only she had chances to approach his mother."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie's eyes were brimmed with intense hope when she saw his gloomy expression. Great. She could kick Diana out of Steven's life completely this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula looked at Queenie in astonishment. "What do you mean? How did you find it out?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie looked very sad. She stared at Steven who remained silent, unsure if he would believe her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I always suspected the culprit is Diana and thus began to secretly collect evidence. I've just finished doing it. If you don't believe me, I'll go take the laptop now. You can plug in the USB to see for yourself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven nodded. "Go get it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lowering her eyes filled with joy, Queenie quickly stood up to get the computer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula clenched her fists. Diana wouldn't do such a thing. Queenie was acting very doubtful. If she had real evidence, she would have exposed Diana much earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie returned with the laptop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven handed her the USB drive. She plugged it into the laptop and clicked the folder open under everybody's gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was footage of Diana busy cooking oatmeal in the kitchen. When the oatmeal was almost done, she crouched down, took out a packet of powder from the cabinet, and poured it into the oatmeal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The next video showed Diana bringing the oatmeal to Steven's mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula was stunned. This video was filmed with a phone, not very clear, but it was obvious that Diana did put something in the oatmeal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's mother was Steven's bottom line. Although she was cold towards Steven because of her husband, Steven still respected her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie knew this well, and thus decided to present this video.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A hint of secret joy flashed in her eyes as Steven's face increasingly darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula saw all this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie was framing Diana again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing that gloating look, she couldn't help but wanna slap this woman to death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If it were allowed, she would surely give Queenie a few good slaps.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Humph! Diana is so vicious. Steven, you must divorce her. Now that the divorce agreement has been signed, I'll have Diana go to the Civil Affairs Bureau tomorrow morning to get the divorce finalized."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula angrily slammed the table. If she urged this scumbag to divorce Diana, Steven would believe the evidence provided by Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie was proficient in computer technology. It was possible that she used a synthesized video.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie was overjoyed. Paula did "help" her a lot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie spoke in a sarcastic tone, "Didn't expect Diana to be so vicious. Your mum was very good to her. To make her marry you, she went to great lengths to drive me away, for the reason that I am not the biological daughter of the Marsh family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I had no choice but to go abroad. But Diana didn't cherish all this at all. She got you so easily while I couldn't no matter how hard I tried. Even in my great sadness, I still pray for your well-being.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Now you've seen it with your own eyes. Diana pretended to be innocent, but you've witnessed all she did these years."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Alas! How did I end up with such a ruthless daughter like Diana?" Jeff couldn't help but feel sad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie said nothing more. Anyway, Diana didn't have much of a place in Steven's heart to begin with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now with the evidence, Diana had offended him completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Steven, don't be angry. It's my fault for not raising her properly. Go get divorced tomorrow. You said earlier that Queenie has called Diana on your behalf.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You gave her a divorce agreement, but she refused to sign it. This time she should have come to her senses. No matter how hard she tries to ingratiate you, it is of no use.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You obviously don't love Diana at all. Queenie earned your love this easily, but Diana got nothing at all in return after doing that much for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her words were meaningful enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula continued, "Diana did her best to serve you, but you only treat her as a free housekeeper."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Queenie not only excels in her studies but is very versatile. Offered a large sum of money monthly by you, she is undoubtedly the happiest girl in the world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In comparison, Diana had to get up at six in the morning to make oatmeal for you and your mother. After you left for work, she would go take care of your mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">You don't feel like others touching your things, but she insisted on organizing your shirts in person and preparing you gifts for banquets. No matter how late it was, she wouldn't sleep until you came back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She even worked herself to the bone by cooking you healthy late-night snacks every day. It was her own money that she used to buy everything you eat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Whatever she does for you was in vain. She was even framed for harming Queenie. Why bother to choose such a woman? Go divorce her as soon as possible."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"A scumbag only deserved another scumbag.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Stay away from my dear daughter!" She thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie's face was paled at Paula's sarcastic words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But her words did make sense. She had done nothing for Steven but managed to earn his love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">To some degree, she seemed to be dwarfed by Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie was shocked. Not until now did she realize that she hadn't done anything for Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With each word Paula spoke, Steven's face darkened more and more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her aim was clear enough&mdash;divorced Diana as soon as possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven slowly stood up, stared at the three of them.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="107.html">« Prev</a><a href="109.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
