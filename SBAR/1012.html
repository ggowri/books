My grandma has been waiting for you. She likes you very much and talks about you almost every day. She wishes you could be with her 24 hours a day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She liked Diana more than her own granddaughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't refuse her invitation. Even though she was in a bad mood, the bad guys got the punishment they deserved, so she felt quite good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She also liked Rita very much. She was an elegant and loving lady who had experienced a lot. Sometimes, just one word from her could make Diana see things in a completely new light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana replied, "Alright. I'll go with you. I do miss Rita."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was so happy that she pushed her to the car. After helping her get in, she put the folding wheelchair in the trunk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she got into the driver's seat with a beaming smile and drove away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula followed out and watched them leave, her face already in floods of tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew in her heart that it was too late. Her daughter would never look back at her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But thinking about what she said about the DNA test, could it be that her biological father has been watching her secretly all along?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And why did Edward make such a request to Jeff?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he know who Diana really was?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was accustomed to thinking things through in the long term.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked quite like her. But her profile bore a strong resemblance to her father's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She still remembered the man. She wanted to forget him, but his appearance was so captivating that one glance left an eternal memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was well-dressed, had an outstanding appearance, exuded an air of refinement, and what's more, he was extremely wealthy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She got married at a young age back then. She was able to keep going because of Jeff's kindness to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the face of money and work, his hypocritical kindness was completely worthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had a really hard time during that period and didn't get any understanding from her parents. In fact, as people who had experienced life, her parents knew full well that someone like Jeff, a person with honey on his lips but murder in his heart, would not be of any help to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet she still believed that there was true love in this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula laughed painfully, "Haha..." The graceful and luxurious woman's eyes were brimming with tears. A gust of cold wind rushed down her throat, causing her great discomfort and forcing her to cough several times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She coughed. "Ahem..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric quickly walked over, held her up with concern, and asked, "Mom, are you alright? Are you feeling uncomfortable?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head and whispered, "Eric, I'm fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at her pale face. She was in pain, and he was very worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked again, "Mom, did Jeff bully you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After being abandoned, he never called him Dad again and always addressed Jeff as Mr. Jeff Marsh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula sneered, "Eric, he no longer has the ability to bully me. Seeing him lose everything, I wasn't really happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She held Eric's hand, with deep-seated hatred glinting in her eyes, and she said, "Eric, he doesn't deserve to be your father, since he really wants to take the lives of you five siblings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric's heart suddenly ached sharply. He slightly parted his lips, but then he forced himself to shut up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was full of bitterness, but he smiled, "Mom, it's fine. We are all adults. It won't affect us whether he wants us or not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A father's love lacking sincerity, one filled with ulterior motives, was dispensable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Paula still wasn't reconciled. After all, she believed in love once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be the filter of love clouding her judgment that led to such a crushing defeat?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That sole act of indulgence made her feel deeply sorry to Jeff. So after she got pregnant, she did everything she could to treat him well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she never expected that he would swap the two children.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula was upset. She looked at the gray sky and said, "Eric, Diana was here just now. She doesn't want to be with us anymore. She said she forgave me, but it was merely lip service. Deep in her heart, she didn't truly forgive me. If she hadn't been swapped back then, she would still be the most beloved princess in our family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was all because of that despicable person that she became estranged from her daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't care who the child's father was. The deed was done, and she didn't regret it. The baby in her belly was also hers, and she wouldn't favor one over the other. At that time, she truly hoped it would be a girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because Diana's father was someone else, she showed even more love and affection on her after giving birth to her. Every day, she told her four brothers to treat their only sister well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never disliked her for being someone else's child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what changed later?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's return disrupted the peaceful and happy home she ever had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It came to her mind that the daughter she had painstakingly taught for twenty years was not her biological daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was hard for her to accept. Moreover, due to Queenie's various schemes, she was led to believe that Diana was a bad person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought Diana only knew how to be jealous and stop at nothing to gain attention. But in fact, she should have been able to see through all those Queenie's little tricks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She also didn't know why she held such an attitude at the time. Even she herself couldn't figure out why she had that momentary lapse in judgment when all the facts came to light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder the ancients said that a single thought could send one straight to the devil's den.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric comforted her, "Mom, time will dilute everything. Diana will forgive us. As long as we show up in front of her when she needs us the most, she will remember our kindness. You are her mother, and this will never change."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula looked at him and smiled, "Eric, you have really grown up. This isn't what you would've said before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric also laughed, "Mom, after going through so many things, if I don't grow up, you will really abandon me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula nodded with a smile. "That's true. When I saw you guys showed no signs of repentance, I did have such an intention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you and Gale are both changing. As your mother, I want to give you a chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a deep breath and looked at the foggy sky. After Christmas, the sky cleared up. The spring snow melted, and the city became prosperous once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the streets, vehicles flowed continuously, with the horns and engine noises rising and falling. Gazing at the lively and bustling scene, her eyes held a bit more hope and anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Eric, you are right. Time will heal the wound. As long as we are sincere to Diana, she will forgive us one day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was exactly what Eric thought. Suddenly, it occurred to him that an ambulance was parked downstairs. Jeff must have fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly asked, "Mom, I just saw the ambulance coming. Has Jeff been sent to the hospital for emergency treatment?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1011.html">« Prev</a><a href="1013.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
