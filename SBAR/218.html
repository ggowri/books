You stole my designs and used them to your heart's content, didn't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the sight of her, Emma realized what she was here for.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't understand what you mean. How could I possibly steal your designs? You suddenly joined the company. Compared to a capable designer like me, how dare you claim that I plagiarized your works?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana took a step forward with cold, bright eyes like a demon coming out of hell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, let's go to the police station. I can prove that you plagiarized my works."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana roared, "Get up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma was stunned. Then, she reacted and yelled, "I didn't plagiarize your works. Don't slander me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She quickly glanced at Queenie and asked her to help her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana noticed their interaction and suddenly grasped the situation. "Why are you looking at Queenie? You two know each other. Well, I've figured it out. Gale didn't send the photos he had taken to anyone, but the photos in his album disappeared. The only people who have access to his phone are Queenie and Steven. Who else could it be?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie gazed at her intently. "Diana, I think you are out of mind. You can design, so you accuse her of stealing your design drawings. Why don't you create your own works?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What you stole was my design drawings, wasn't it?" Diana retorted with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't slander me. I didn't do that." Queenie took Steven's arm and said, "Steven, say something. Diana has made such a fuss. You should get her out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He withdrew his hand and looked at Emma on the floor. "You'd better tell the truth. Did you steal Diana's design drawings?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He gave her another chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She also realized it, but now she could only deny it. "Mr. Gellar, I didn't."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She believed that Diana had absolutely no evidence because the original drafts had been destroyed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana stared into her eyes, and her tone was extremely icy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Emma, you are a very capable designer. I have always respected the fruits of your labor, but why are you so shameless?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's gaze was cold, causing Emma to panic, but she quickly concealed it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you talking about? How could I steal your designs?" Emma tried to act innocent, but her eyes gave her away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana drew a long breath to prevent a retort. She played a video captured from a surveillance camera she had installed in her office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is a record of my drafts. Every detail was designed by me. This surveillance video shows where and when I drew them every day and how Gale took them away." Diana showed the video to Emma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her face turned pale in fright instantly. To her surprise, Diana had such solid evidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I-I..." Emma stammered, unable to utter a complete sentence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Emma, designers rely on their dignity. I didn't expect you to plagiarize."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana fixed her eyes on her with disappointment. "Do you know what these designs mean to me? They are the most important drafts of my collaboration with the Powell Group. And you stole them for your own benefit."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="217.html">« Prev</a><a href="219.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
