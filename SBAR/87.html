"Ms. Marsh, please watch your mouth, and only someone with a dirty mind could say such dirty things. We are talking about cooperation."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon seeing that Alexander was explaining for Diana, Queenie thought it was a bit ridiculous and thought, "Why the hell is Diana so attractive?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie usually looked down on Diana, just wanting to step on her and never let her get up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Powell, she's just a tomboy from a village, and she can't even understand a contract, so how could she possibly come and sign one with you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, I know you want to make something of yourself to impress your family and Steven, but it's enough to play this trick once or twice."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shut up! What do you mean by playing hard to get? On the contrary, you seduced a married man, you truly impressed us."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander retorted nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was speechless, thinking, "It's all Steven's fault. Why did he marry Diana?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn't afford to offend Alexander.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie looked at Steven with a grievance. "Steven, did you just watch them bully me? Diana even did it so embarrassingly, but why haven't you divorced her yet? Why did you make me be yelled at as a mistress?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at Diana, her eyes calm, no longer arguing with him in anger like she used to when he spoke up for Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven suddenly remembered Owen's words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, no one will wait for you where you are for the rest of her life, and no matter how much she loves you, her love will be gradually worn away by your ruthlessness."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven instantly felt upset, and the girl who only cared about him truly didn't love him anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at Diana with a forced smile. "Diana, your trick..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No," Diana interrupted Steven, her tone was very calm. "Steven, I truly have no tricks this time, and I am so tired that I don't want to continue to be with you anymore. I just want to fulfill you and Queenie, and I hope that you will be together forever and have a child soon."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If it's possible, let's go through with the divorce right now, shall we?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled indifferently, his attractive face instantly mesmerizing Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sat quietly and turned to look at Diana, and they looked at each other. His deep and sharp eyes made Diana avert her gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said calmly, "Diana, you forget that I told you last time that we couldn't get a divorce unless we died."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why did he say that again? Diana glared at him, her large and bright eyes filled with anger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you're not divorcing me, what are you doing here? Mr. Gellar, if you're not going to talk about divorce from now on, please don't come to me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stood up and smiled naughtily at Alexander and Nolan, "Mr. Watson, Mr. Powell, let's go. We should eat somewhere else."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was hungry and didn't want to be so disgusted by these people that she couldn't even eat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander glanced coldly at Steven. "Okay!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nolan stood up and helped Diana to her feet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven saw Nolan's hand on Diana's arm and wanted to wring Nolan's hand off.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He tightened his hands on the table slightly, his eyes filled with irritation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie looked at Steven in dismay and thought, "Diana wanted a divorce, but why wouldn't he?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They wouldn't get divorced unless they were dead.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What am I then?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Am </span><span>I</span><span> his mistress?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By the time Diana and the other two had left, Queenie looked at Steven with grievance with tears in her eyes. "Steven, what do you think you're doing to me? What do you think I am? You said you'd marry me, but how could you go back on your word?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stood up and looked at her indifferently. "Queenie, I thought I made it clear to you last time. "</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="86.html">« Prev</a><a href="88.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
