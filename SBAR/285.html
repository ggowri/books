She looked even more stunning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige liked seafood, and the table was filled with seafood dishes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As they dined and conversed, laughter filled the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank found the scene before him incredibly distasteful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seated across from him was Diana. If it were a man, he would have exploded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Frank," Elsie called out, her gaze shifting between the gorgeous Paige and Frank's intense fixation on her, a sense of unease washing over her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lost in their own discussion, Diana and Paige didn't notice Frank and Elsie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as Frank was about to leave with a frown, Paige's next words caught his attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, you mentioned introducing me to Julius. When?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank's fists clenched as he fixated on Paige's expectant expression. While it was a relief that she no longer bothered him and decided to see other men, the anger within him surged, and his eyes turned cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So much for her affection for me!" he thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana, noting Paige's curiosity, nodded. "Julius won't be back until my birthday. I'll personally set you up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige exclaimed, "I've heard about Julius being kind and handsome. I can't wait to meet him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Displaying a photo on her phone, Diana introduced Julius to Paige.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Look, this is Julius, unfiltered," she shared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige looked at the man on the screen, dressed in a white t-shirt with stylish bangs. His features were chiseled, exuding a gentle and refined aura. Frank was nothing compared to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, my goodness, Diana, Julius is incredibly attractive. Are you really setting him up with me?" Paige expressed her disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Feeling inadequate, she added, "He's too good-looking. I fear that other women will mock me for not being on his level if we're together." She had never thought about pursuing such a handsome man</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, he's way out of my league," Paige said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amused, Diana replied, "Don't worry. You have only seen Julius' face. When you see him in person, you'll be even more amazed. Any woman would be captivated once they see him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her three brothers were all strikingly attractive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"For a man like him, I must make myself prettier to win his heart at first sight. He's my type," Paige said, excitedly grasping Diana's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, my hands are still oily from the lobster," Diana chuckled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige released her grip. "Diana, the lobster here is good. I have a business trip this month and might return in a month. By then, Julius will likely be back, and I can meet him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana confirmed, "Yes, my birthday is in October. It's around the corner. The day my grandfather found me became my birthday, so Julius will soon return. I also miss him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige bubbled with thrill. "You're truly lucky. If I had such a stunning brother, I'd never leave his side."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, a voice interrupted, "Paige, aren't you coming to my wedding?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="284.html">« Prev</a><a href="286.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
