Take your sister to the hospital. She has fainted."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric pretended to be very anxious and ran in. "Queenie, what happened to you? Why did you suddenly faint?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario roared, "Stop talking nonsense. Take Ms. Marsh to the hospital immediately. If anything happens to her, I will kill you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric looked at Mario, who was anxious. He had always wondered why Mario was so devoted to Queenie. Now he understood it was because they were both ruthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Mario had special feelings towards Queenie. Whenever he saw Queenie, he was smiling, and the look in his eyes was also different.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric squatted down and carried Queenie on his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario picked up the blanket on the sofa and covered Queenie with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric drove Queenie to a nearby hospital and then went to pay the medical bill for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way to pay the bill, Eric sent a message to Diana using a new number.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Diana, the Barnes Group Queenie acquired has become a shell company, and she suffered stock losses. She fainted from anger.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was eating casseroles on the sixth floor with her friends. When she saw the message from an unfamiliar number, she smiled, and she knew who sent the message.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Eric.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana showed the phone to Paige and Althea. "See, Queenie fainted from anger. She schemed against Paula, who raised her since she was a child. She got her retribution."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige and Althea were shocked when they saw the message.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea found it a little unbelievable. "Did Queenie do this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded. "Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea was very angry. Thinking of Paula's doting on Queenie over the years, she thought Queenie was an ungrateful person.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula had high expectations for Queenie. Queenie also worked hard and won many awards. In college, Queenie was an outstanding student.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did Queenie become like this? Paula, her four brothers, and Steven all doted on her. Steven even hurt you many times for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She is a little princess who grew up in a castle. Sometimes I even envy her because she has four brothers who love her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even Steven protected her, fearing that she would get hurt. I still remember when it snowed heavily the year before last, Queenie was having her period. Steven stayed with her in her room all night..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Althea..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige quickly reminded Althea that Diana was still sitting there.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea also reacted quickly and looked at Diana. "Diana, I'm sorry. I know you haven't..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled and waved her hands. "It's okay, I don't have any feelings for Steven anymore. After getting a divorce, I will be completely free. You can talk boldly. Those things can't hurt me anymore. I don't care how he pampers Queenie. I want to become a rich woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Diana's smile, Paige and Althea felt sad for her. They both knew how much Diana loved Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea said, "Diana, you are still young. You will meet someone better in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course. I will meet someone better in the future, and he will love me deeply." Diana believed she would have good luck.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea smiled and patted her shoulder. "Diana, the person who favors you will appear."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="764.html">« Prev</a><a href="766.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
