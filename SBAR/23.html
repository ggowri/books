Aside from his interactions with people from the company, he only communicated with his family. There were no signs of a mistress or an affair.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Upon receiving this news, Paula wished she could tear Diana in half. Because of Diana&#x27;s words, Paula had been feeling uneasy for the past few days.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Initially, Paula thought that after their divorce, Diana would have nowhere to go, so she intended to give her a shabby old house on the outskirts of the city, only to take it back when Diana got married. Now, Paula realized it was unnecessary.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She would no longer care about a daughter who had ill wishes towards her own biological mother.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Doubting Jeff had caused Paula to feel guilty, and in her guilt, she forgot about conducting a paternity test. She only thinking about making it up to him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Meanwhile, Jeff, outside the room, narrowed his eyes as he looked at Paula, watching her doubts dissipate and a guilty expression take on her face. With a triumphant smile, he quietly went downstairs.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula had no idea that the people she had sent to follow Jeff were actually working for him. Over the years, Jeff&#x27;s people had infiltrated the entire Barnes family, putting the family under his control.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Back then, the Marsh family was a modest one, and it was Jeff&#x27;s charm and that incident that led him to marry Paula. Ever since, he had enjoyed a comfortable life, reaping the benefits of his union with Paula.</p><p style="text-align:left;">However, his true intention was to eventually get rid of his daughter, four sons, and even his wife.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Knowing Paula&#x27;s character well, he understood that her suspicion would drive her to treat him well for a while to erase her guilt.</p><p style="text-align:left;">With these thoughts, Jeff happily hummed a tune as he went downstairs.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie was already prepared to attend the party, waiting for Steven to pick her up. She was in a very good mood today.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Today, she would see Diana apologize in public, and her selfless act of saving Rita would boost her own image and prepare her to enter the entertainment industry.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Seeing Jeff beaming, she smiled and asked, &quot;Dad, why are you so happy?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jeff smiled affectionately at his beautiful daughter, his grin growing wider. &quot;Something good. Let&#x27;s go. Your mom is waiting for us. We&#x27;ll head directly to the party since Steven won&#x27;t be joining us.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie smiled maliciously. Tonight, she had arranged for reporters to destroy Diana.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The online arguments were in full swing, and everyone was eager to attend the party to see Diana apologize and beg for mercy.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In order to enter the entertainment industry, Queenie had carefully crafted her public persona. She had managed to gain a degree of popularity, and in the eyes of others, she was kind, gentle, and Steven&#x27;s loving girlfriend.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She had become the center of attention, while Diana was the target of criticism. Rumors even said she had stolen Queenie&#x27;s boyfriend Steven.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The online criticism against Diana grew increasingly harsh.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Inside the car, Steven sat silently, dressed in a dark suit that accentuated his perfect figure.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He watched the news and saw Diana being bashed on the internet, his brows furrowed.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The driver was his assistant, Evan Brooks.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Evan also saw the news and discussions online. Diana had always been kind to him, so he couldn&#x27;t help but ask, &quot;Mr. Gellar, would you like me to deal with the news?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="22.html">« Prev</a><a href="24.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
