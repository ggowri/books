It had been a long time since he last drank the seafood soup made by Diana, and tonight, he finally had a satisfying meal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige also had an unfriendly expression towards Steven. Only Diana, who had received money, was eating happily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana glanced at his phone and said, "Cecil, the tide won't go out until after 2 AM tonight. You all said not to worry about me; I'm used to night diving."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Diana finished speaking, he heard Paige say, "Diana, don't dive. That witch is here. Let's go back. We need to avoid her to stay safe."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If what happened last night had occurred with only her, she would have been harmed long ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was very confused. "Witch? What witch?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil explained, "Queenie! Now that she's here, let's switch to another island or just go back. I don't want to die in the sea."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked out the window, and it was indeed Queenie. She was standing at the bow of the boat, wearing a swimsuit. Queenie's figure was truly very sexy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana frowned and said, "Then let's go back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven looked at the three of them, his brows slightly furrowed, very curious as to why they were so afraid of Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan was also a bit scared, feeling as if he had been targeted by Queenie. "Um... Ms. Bishop, I... I have a stomachache. It might be seafood. Could you take me back too? I don't feel safe staying here, and I'm afraid I might pass out from the pain."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked at Evan in confusion. He had just eaten two large plates of spaghetti and two big lobsters; how could he possibly have a stomachache?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan looked at her with a pleading expression. After all, he didn't dare to bet his life on Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked at Steven and said in a cool tone, "As long as your boss agrees, you can leave with us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan smiled and said, "Mr. Gellar, I'm not feeling well in my stomach. I'll head back first and won't disturb you and Ms. Marsh anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Evan." Steven looked at them angrily and said helplessly, "Then let's go back together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was good to go back; on land, Queenie couldn't compete with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil said, "Mr. Farley, Evan, then you should return to your ship. We are heading back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven and Evan were blocked by Queenie as soon as they got off the boat. She asked reproachfully, "Steven, why didn't you take me with you when you went out to sea for fun?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's tall figure appeared even more striking under the setting sun. He hadn't told Queenie about his whereabouts, yet she had still managed to track him down here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven narrowed his eyes. It seemed that Queenie could always find his location, and considering how she had previously framed him, it was too much of a coincidence for her to show up every time he just arrived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, there must have been people working for Queenie around him, and not just one. He had been testing this possibility several times recently. This time, Queenie showed up again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He frowned and asked her with an icy tone, "How did you know I was here?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="408.html">« Prev</a><a href="410.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
