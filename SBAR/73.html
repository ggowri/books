She exuded grace and refinement.</p><p>As Diana entered, Rita flashed a gentle, gracious smile. &quot;Diana, you&#x27;re here. Come, sit by Grandma.&quot;</p><p>Diana felt a twinge of unease as she looked at the kindly Rita. At their last encounter at the party, she&#x27;d been quite the hellraiser, even roughing up her precious grandson.</p><p>Rita&#x27;s warmth during this second meeting felt almost surreal to Diana.</p><p>Her steps faltered as she approached.</p><p>&quot;Hello, Grandma!&quot; Diana responded smoothly, going along with the familial term.</p><p>&quot;Good, good, good! Ever since I took your medicine, I&#x27;ve been feeling great.&quot;</p><p>Rita had taken a real liking to Diana. Recalling the girl&#x27;s deft moves from their last encounter, she knew this young woman was both open-minded and far from ordinary.</p><p>A broad-minded person could accept all sorts of people - something Cecil was incapable of. Cecil had always been petty.</p><p>&quot;Grandma, this is a gift for you,&quot; Diana said, handing over an exquisite silk box. &quot;It&#x27;s Fragrant Pills. They can help with minor ailments.&quot;</p><p>Rita accepted the gift with a smile, clutching it in her hands like a treasure.</p><p>She marveled at how someone so young could possess such remarkable medical skills.</p><p>Cecil, feeling left out, piped up, &quot;Diana, don&#x27;t I get a present?&quot;</p><p>Diana rummaged through her bag for a moment before pulling out a jet-black pill. She held it out to Cecil. &quot;It&#x27;s a life-saving pill. Want it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Cecil, I know you&#x27;re into racing. It&#x27;s a dangerous sport. Make sure you always check your car thoroughly before getting behind the wheel.&quot;</p><p>Cecil&#x27;s eyes flickered as he accepted the pill with a smile. In a critical moment, this could be a lifesaver.</p><p>As Diana watched him accept it, a cold glint shimmered in the depths of her eyes. This drug was actually meant for Gale, the head of the Marsh family.</p><p>But Cecil would never believe her if she told him that.</p><p>In her past life, she&#x27;d noticed something off about his car. She warned Gale, but he didn&#x27;t believe her. After the accident, he and Queenie turned the tables, pinning the blame on her.</p><p>Queenie was a savvy woman with a knack for getting things done. Just look at these recent incidents...</p><p>If she hadn&#x27;t been prepared in advance, she&#x27;d never have cleared her name. That woman was not only cunning but also knew how to win people over.</p><p>With her soft features, she was a real heartbreaker. Men fell for her left and right.</p><p>The four Marsh brothers doted on Queenie like crazy, catering to her every whim.</p><p>This time around, she wouldn&#x27;t try to stop what happened in her past life.</p><p>&quot;Diana, what&#x27;s on your mind?&quot; Cecil&#x27;s devilish voice cut through her thoughts.</p><p>Diana snapped back to reality, gazing at Cecil&#x27;s devilishly handsome face. She gave a faint smile and said, &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s nothing. I just remembered there&#x27;s a car race coming up soon. I heard you&#x27;re into racing too. Think you could take me to watch it?&quot;</p><p>She loved racing, but she only wanted to see how Gale would wreck himself.</p><p>That man had treated her horribly.</p><p>Cecil and Rita were momentarily taken aback.</p><p>Cecil grinned and asked, &quot;Diana, you&#x27;re into racing?&quot;</p><p>Diana&#x27;s expression returned to normal, her smile light. &quot;I love watching it!&quot;</p><p>She did love it, but Leopold wouldn&#x27;t let her on the track, fearing for her safety. If she dared to race, he&#x27;d have a fit.</p><p>Rita looked at her grandson. &quot;Cecil, it&#x27;s not a big deal. Why don&#x27;t you take Diana to the track to watch?&quot;</p><p>Cecil always listened to Rita. She doted on him the most. He smiled, &quot;No problem, Grandma. I&#x27;ll take Diana along and let her experience the thrill of high-speed racing.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#x27;s wonderful, you young folks enjoy yourselves. This old lady will sit this one out.&quot;</p><p>Rita&#x27;s eyes suddenly turned severe. &quot;Diana, tell me, who&#x27;s pulling Queenie&#x27;s strings? I&#x27;ve been digging for ages but can&#x27;t find anything.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m certain it was something she put in my drink that caused my incident.&quot;</p><p>Diana pondered for a moment. In her past life, the Farley family had been swallowed up by Queenie&#x27;s backer a year from now.</p><p>She said, &quot;Grandma, it won&#x27;t be long. That person will show up soon. You all need to be extremely careful this year.&quot;</p><p>Rita had come today specifically to hear these words.</p><p>She&#x27;d already consulted fortune tellers who predicted a significant crisis for her and the Farley family this year.</p><p>She&#x27;d already dodged one bullet, and with Diana&#x27;s warning, she now had a plan in mind.</p><p>Cecil&#x27;s eyes narrowed as he gazed at Diana&#x27;s slightly flushed cheeks. Her beauty was utterly breathtaking.</p><p>Even in casual clothes, she was stunning. Her natural beauty meant clothes were mere accessories to her face, unable to hide her innate aura.</p><p>Curiosity got the better of him, and he bluntly asked, &quot;Diana, how did you figure out there&#x27;s someone behind Queenie?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="72.html">« Prev</a><a href="74.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
