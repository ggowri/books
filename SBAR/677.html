He had heard about what had happened at the Foliot family banquet last night.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Queenie is Jeff's biological daughter, and Jeff lost his daughter. This is really messy and cruel."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, are you really your father's biological daughter?" asked Owen impolitely.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was stunned and whispered, "Owen, I don't know either. I only found out about it yesterday. My parents have obtained their marriage license, and we are a family now."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was eager to prove that she was not an illegitimate daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen smiled and said nothing. He thought, "Anyway, Steven has a bad sense of choosing women."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, Owen would realize that Steven had a better sense than him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he would regret it for the rest of his life!</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. I'm leaving now. You guys can chat."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie went in only after Owen left.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Steven knew that I was in a bad mood last night, but he didn't go to accompany me. If I had encountered such a thing in the past, Steven would have always been by my side. Although he didn't know how to make girls happy, his company would make me happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Queenie went in, she sent a message to Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She found a suitable photo and sent it to Diana as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Diana, Steven was with me the whole time last night. We have been together for such a long time. Why are you so shameless and still pestering Steven? Can't you just leave us alone?]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, Queenie walked towards Steven, who was sitting on the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, why didn't you come to accompany me last night?" Queenie sat next to Steven and, with a hint of fear in her eyes, looked at his gloomy face.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eyes were meaningful. "Queenie, everyone knows about last night's incident. My 100 million dollars has gone down the drain. Do you think your movie can still be released?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's eyes were full of grievance. "Steven, I came here today just to talk about this matter. I suspect that what happened last night was a plot by Diana against me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eyes were filled with murderous intent, thinking, "She plotted against Diana just like this before, and I thought so too." His eyes became even colder. "But yesterday, she stayed with me the whole day. I took her to the banquet. How could I not know if she had plotted against you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven felt highly powerless. He thought, "It turns out that I misunderstood Diana before.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I trusted Queenie very much and trusted her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was so busy with work that I never gave it much thought. But because of this simple negligence, Diana no longer wants me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's face became more gloomy, and his eyes were getting colder and colder.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, Queenie just wanted to shift all the blame to Diana and did not notice Steven's terrible expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was surprised and at a loss, thinking, "I have done so much before. Why did Diana get the advantage?" Then, she said, "Steven, did you go together?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's tone became more serious. "Yes. She was my female companion last night. Mrs. Foliot did not invite her. You said she plotted against you. How did she do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie finally saw Steven's cold and handsome face.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were full of panic. She knew that Steven was furious. She looked at Steven with tears on her face. "Steven, please help me. Are you going to let your money go to waste?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please let Diana come out and apologize, saying that all this was arranged by her and Mrs. Foliot to slander me. Then, I will be cleared. Steven, we grew up together. You have to help me. Besides, you once promised that you would marry me, right?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="676.html">« Prev</a><a href="678.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
