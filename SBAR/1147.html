Investigate their background thoroughly. The companies they took from the Robinson family, the Toby family, and the Foliot family are just what we can see. Use our hidden forces to make all these companies go bankrupt."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The grudge from the previous life, he must avenge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan thought this wasn't a difficult task. These companies are all in the development stage. When Queenie seized the companies, they had already noticed and were aware of their partners and partnerships.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Queenie is good at management and has an elite team, two members of her elite team are already out of the picture. As long as the remaining two are destroyed, Queenie's power will be greatly weakened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without that elite team helping her, her strength will diminish.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A professional team is hard to dismantle, but they can be taken down separately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie will be left without support.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only that, Cecil is also secretly suppressing Queenie's company.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their speed is a bit slow, but it's not illegal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, killing someone is easy, but doing it legally and reasonably takes time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan said, "Mr. Gellar, it can be done within ten days. We've been investigating them all along, and I've been preparing as well."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said harshly, "Leave these matters to you. Within a month, I want all of Queenie's companies bankrupt."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan was excited. Because of Queenie, he almost died. Now he has found evidence to send her to prison.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, leave this matter to me. I won't let you down."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven knew Evan also hated Queenie, but in the end, he would handle it himself. "Alright! Now there's an even more important matter. Take me to buy materials for folding roses."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan said in surprise, "This is important too?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was very confused.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "Once the address is confirmed, we'll head out immediately."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan said, "Mr. Gellar, we can wait at home for same-city delivery."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven asked, "Can it be delivered today?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan smiled helplessly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven knows nothing about life except being able to make money.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Same-city delivery is very convenient now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven turned on his phone and asked, "Where to buy?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan opened the app and let him choose his favorite color.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven filled in the address and phone number before shopping.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He chose pink for the heart color.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For the handmade rose paper, he chose the color-changing one that sparkles under the light.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Giving roses to someone you like symbolizes beautiful love.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There are rumors that roses represent passionate love for a partner.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven read it and smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly placed an order and then started learning online how to fold hearts and roses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan was shocked. "Mr. Gellar, why are you buying these? Aren't they for kids?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, why do you need these?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "Diana asked me to fold them. Once the materials arrive, you can leave."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven gracefully stood up, found some white paper in the cabinet, and started practicing origami.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan, watching him from the side, was very puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan really couldn't understand their romance as a couple, wondering if Diana was reminiscing about the past.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan waited for forty minutes. The materials Steven needed had all arrived.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After bringing in the materials, Evan went to work.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Steven sat alone on the first floor folding hearts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The method for folding hearts was very simple. He learned it after practicing three times.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He folded hearts for four hours straight, placed them in a beautiful glass jar, and wrote meaningful wishes inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was then that he understood why Diana liked origami.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because the jar filled with hearts was beautiful, placed in a prominent spot, very romantic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled. He had been sitting for too long, his legs were a bit numb. He stood up, stretched his legs, and then went upstairs to see Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He pushed the door open and saw Diana still sleeping.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There&rsquo;s an auction tonight, featuring diamonds from other countries, and Steven wants to take her along.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He walked over, sat by the bed, and saw her sleeping soundly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, wake up. Don't sleep too long, or you won't be able to sleep tonight."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana heard his voice and slowly opened her eyes. Her legs hurt a lot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why did you wake me up? I'm still so sleepy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana closed her eyes, wanting to continue sleeping.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled and patted her face, saying, "Diana, aren't you hungry?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was hungry, but she wanted to sleep more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if she was hungry, she still wanted to sleep.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven picked her up. Only then did Diana reluctantly open her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven gently said, "Diana, don't sleep anymore. You won't be able to sleep at night."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana replied, "I sleep so well, I could sleep for three days and nights."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven carried her to the bathroom to freshen up. "Diana, if you don't want to meet acquaintances, then let's go to the auction house. There's a beautiful jewelry auction tonight, and I want to give you something. Let's go together."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"For dinner, let's go to Capitole Hotel. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought it was fine. "Alright, you arrange it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven knew she wasn't fully awake yet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When they first started living together, he already knew she looked adorable when she woke up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven held Diana at this moment, feeling her skin even through the clothes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the bathroom, Diana tried to perk up and noticed the hickey on her neck was quite obvious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She glared angrily at Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven felt quite helpless. He clearly hadn't been too rough, yet there were many marks on her body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her and said, "Diana, I wasn't rough; it's because your skin is too delicate."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn&rsquo;t want to talk about it, pointed to the door, and said, &ldquo;Wait for me outside.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled and went to help her find the dress for tonight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana watched him leave and breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She washed her face, feeling much more awake. Looking at the sunset outside the window, she realized she had slept for a long time.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1146.html">« Prev</a><a href="1148.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
