He shouted, "This is just Diana's ploy to grab my attention!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I kicked her out of the car, and now she's trying to make me feel guilty. She's really foolish. I won't go see her, and don't ever bring her up in front of me again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Steven turned and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan watched his leave with pressed lips, feeling a wave of pity for Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided not to mention Diana's situation and planned to visit her after work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the island, Queenie had just wrapped up filming when Mario handed her a phone with a smirk. "Ms. Marsh, we encouraged Samuel a little, and he really went after Diana."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Queenie frowned upon seeing the news. "Why didn't he kill her? If she survives, it's not a success."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario replied, "Diana reacted quickly. When the car was about to turn, she jumped onto the hood. She isn't seriously hurt, but we've successfully turned Samuel against Cecil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, we'll just wait and reap the profits."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie found this idea appealing. She narrowed her eyes and said, "If it weren't for Diana, the Farley family would already be ours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario wore a sinister smile, oozing malice and conspiracy. "Ms. Marsh, the Foliot family will soon be within our grasp. Jace is very obsessed with you. I have arranged for people to be with me. I can deal with him at any time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie felt reassured by his reliability. "Good! Keep encouraging Samuel so Felicity can seize her opportunity. It has to be done cleanly. We need an executioner; we won't do it ourselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario sneered, "Ms. Marsh, Samuel is our executioner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smiled, but her beautiful smile concealed a deep-seated malice that sent chills down one's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, Diana was wheeled out of the examination room and into a VIP ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom entered with her medical records, followed by Joseph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph looked at Diana's pale face, his concern evident. "Diana, does it hurt?" he asked, a suppressed emotion lingering in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana met his gaze and smiled. "Yeah, it hurts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom signed off on her records and said, "Fortunately, the injury is to your left hand, and it's not too severe. You've got some soft tissue damage, but you'll be fine after some rest. There are no broken bones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, you have some serious scratches on your back. Diana, you were really lucky this time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, recalling how Leopold had forced her to learn boxing and build her strength since childhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once people got lazy, their reflexes and thinking slowed down. Only through regular exercise could one sharpen their reactions and save themselves in critical moments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that she had faced an actual threat, she finally understood Leopold's intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a mischievous grin, she said, "Tom, you know my skills. When danger strikes, I react quickly. It's just like diving; the ocean can be just as dangerous."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="471.html">« Prev</a><a href="473.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
