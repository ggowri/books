Her satisfied face was flushed with a deep red, her breath a little heavy. She smiled brightly. Her eyes gleamed with tenderness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"George, you take the picture. I'm too tired. Making Diana angry is a must. I want to make her wish she were dead," she murmured, leaning into his embrace. She had to admit that George really did satisfy her in ways she hadn't known she needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His presence soothed her mind, and her entire body felt at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George really knew how to comfort her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George smiled, his voice full of suggestive warmth. "Sure! Hand me the phone. I'll take a much better shot than you. Let's make Diana see how spoiled you are by me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can tell Diana still loves Steven. Too bad Steven is long gone, swallowed up by the sea and fed to the sharks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie felt a twinge of reluctance. If Steven were still around, before everything had happened, he would have been her stepping stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had incredible abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was more valuable than George.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie handed her phone to George. He adjusted the angle. His gaze was filled with deep affection and tenderness, deliberately for Diana to see. He wanted to watch her suffer, to enjoy her heartbreak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had taken everything from Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smiled slightly as if the entire world now consisted only of the two of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After six rapid shots, George handed the phone back to Queenie so she could send the photos to Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then helped her into a wheelchair. His chest ached, so he couldn't carry her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They returned to the bed, starting another round of passionate activity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie loved George's skills in this regard. On lonely nights, it allowed her to sleep soundly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, I love you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the heat of the moment, George felt utterly at ease, his words of affection flowing effortlessly. Queenie, overwhelmed by his intensity, was left disoriented, but her body and soul were deeply satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body tensed as she experienced the ultimate pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The morning sunlight streamed through the window, bathing the room in a soft, golden glow that shimmered across the white furniture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana slowly opened her eyes, greeted by a clear sky. A faint smile curved on her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been a while since she had seen the sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stretched lazily, her hair spreading across the pillow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She slowly sat up, rubbing her eyes. She had slept well last night, and a smile showed on her face, her mood light and pleasant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the morning light, her skin looked even softer, and her large eyes shone like stars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah... finally, the sun," Diana murmured as she got out of bed and picked up her phone to check the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She saw a message and photos from Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie: [Diana, Steven really adores me. Just look at how great he is. You and Steven have been married for years, but he wouldn't even touch you, finding you disgusting. He remained pure for me and gave me the best. You're just an unwanted bastard woman.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The photo showed the aftermath of their passionate night together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their flushed faces and the sickening aura practically spilled from the screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smirked, rolling her eyes. It was typical of Queenie to gross her out first thing in the morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought for a moment and then replied with a smile: [No need to send me such photos again. I wish you two a lifetime of happiness and many children.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[You two are truly a perfect match. One is extremely fake, and the other is thoroughly disgusting. What a perfect pair. You won't find many like you in love. These vulgar photos truly match your tastes and statuses.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[You two better hold on tight and not become a short-lived couple. At least let me see you grow old together. That's the least you can do after everything you've done to upset me.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Two bastards, I hope you torture each other."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She placed her phone on the bed, fuming as she went to the bathroom to freshen up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie, who had slept soundly, woke up early. She reached for her vibrating phone and, seeing Diana's message, a mocking gleam flashed in her eyes. She thought, "Diana must have been crying somewhere last night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She texted me so early in the morning, seems like she's really angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George and I will definitely not grow old together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because after Diana dies, he will also leave this world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie remembered reading a popular short novel once, where the empress became powerful by leveraging the influence of the men around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every man who loved her became her stepping stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the man she loved most, in order to ensure her position as empress, was sacrificed. His vision was truly grand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was Queenie's fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She put the phone down and looked at George lying beside her. Perhaps she loved Steven a bit more than she realized. She would keep him close, just like she did with Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie slowly sat up. Now, it was time to focus on Mario. She needed to know everything happening in Diana's lab.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would never let Diana have it better than her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula might have planned everything, but how could she know what Queenie truly wanted?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cruel smile curled on Queenie's lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, what's with that scary smile so early in the morning?" George asked, waking up. He propped himself up on his hand and gently held her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was perfect in every way. Her body was soft and fragrant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was far more perfect than Yvette.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie gave him a tender smile. "Nothing. Diana just sent me a message this morning. She wished us a lifetime of happiness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George chuckled softly and pulled her into his embrace. The sheets were already on the floor from last night's passionate exertions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, don't worry. We'll grow old together. You're the one I love most."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie simply smiled. It wasn't like before, when she would eagerly leap into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He noticed it immediately. In the past, whenever he said this, she would always happily fall into his arms and say happily, "George, I love you, too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, her calm response made George feel uneasy. "Queenie, did you change your mind? I don't care if you've had another man's child. Why would you care about my past?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I remember that whenever I told you I loved you, you'd always get so happy and jump into my arms."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice sounded very similar to Steven's, but the tone Steven used was something he could never replicate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gentle voice reminded her of the times Steven had been tender with her. Looking at his face, identical to Steven's, she felt a moment of confusion. Recently, she found herself constantly remembering the kindness Steven had shown her. Could it be that the person she truly loved was Steven?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="996.html">« Prev</a><a href="998.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
