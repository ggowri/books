I've done some digging, and it turns out Wyatt and Queenie were in contact.

Your dad managed to escape once, but he won't be so lucky again.

We'll be at the hospital soon. Just let me know where it hurts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana opened her eyes and managed a small smile.

Joseph said, turning to Tom. "Tom, I want to stay with her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom, seeing the worry in Joseph's eyes, replied with a reassuring smile, "Leave her in our care.
