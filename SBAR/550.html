"Steven, you guessed right&mdash;I did it on purpose. Do you remember the time I asked you to meet and talk about you and Queenie? I stood outside for four hours in the snow, waiting. You told me you'd come, that we'd finally talk about divorcing, yet you never showed. Instead, you were with her, taking care of her while she feigned a stomach ache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even before her birthday party, I tried to talk to you about the divorce. But then, you vanished for months, only to reappear and slap me unconscious at her party.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two hours was all you could manage to wait today, huh? Isn't it clear where your patience lies? All of it reserved for your dear Queenie, while you can't even give me a minute's worth. Your Love to her is obvious, isn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furiously, Steven shot back. "Diana, I know I failed you before. I couldn't see clearly, but I'm here now to apologize, truly..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough, Steven." Diana's voice cut through his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apologize? Don't flatter yourself. I wouldn't accept one from someone like you. You and Queenie are two of a kind&mdash;you feed off what marriage to me offers you while indulging in whatever little romantic thrill you have together. She gets your care, you get your pride, while I'm here to make things easier for both of you. Queenie tried so hard to get me off her way. Tell me, if I left, could you two live as comfortably? If you wanted out, why not divorce?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's face softened. "Diana, I know, I was wrong before, and I want to fix this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need. Your actions speak for themselves. You're a married man who can't respect boundaries. On the day I asked for a divorce, she pretended to faint, and I was struck by you and passed out&mdash;yet you took her to the hospital. An apology isn't enough to mend this. Men like you always justify cheating, wrapping it in some grandiose excuse to shield your own guilt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Save it, Steven," she scoffed. "Now, let me guess. Queenie's an orphan raised by the Marsh family, fragile and needy. She saved your life once, didn't she? Nothing happened, right? Spare me, please. I've heard it all, and I'm done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only speak to me if it's about the divorce. Otherwise, leave me be. I hate you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana ended the call, a glint of satisfaction warming her icy gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wished people like Steven stop pestering her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana wanted to live a peaceful life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven glared at his phone in frustration. Despite lowering his pride, Diana wouldn't relent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had ensnared him, but he intended to root out the threat her hidden accomplice posed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once that was settled, he intented on bringing Diana back, safeguarding her from Queenie's ambitions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, no matter what he said, she would believe that there was something fishy going on between him and Queenie.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="549.html">« Prev</a><a href="551.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
