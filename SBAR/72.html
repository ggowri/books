"Cecil's voice held a hint of charm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He got out himself to open the door for Diana, ushering her in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's lips curved into a slight smile. "Thanks!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil gazed at her exquisite features, his captivating eyes twinkling with an even warmer smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright Diana, let's roll," Cecil said as he started driving towards the restaurant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not far away, Steven arrived a moment too late, watching as Cecil drove off with Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie, who had come looking for Steven, also witnessed the scene.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She felt jealous. Cecil used to be so good to her, but ever since that incident came to light, he'd suddenly become incredibly attentive to Diana instead.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her voice dripped with sweetness as she said, "Steven, what's the deal with Diana? First Alexander, now Cecil... isn't she just playing the field?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Steven let out a sneer. "Playing the field, huh? Didn't you have lunch with Mr. Norris' son earlier? You two seemed to be having a grand old time. How come when it's you, it's all innocent, but when it's my wife, suddenly she's playing the field?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie froze. "What?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What did he just say?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Wait... wait...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What was that?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Wife?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Is he admitting Diana is his wife right in front of me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, what are you talking about? I'm the one you love..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've never loved you. If being good to you is love, then that's not love. My kindness and repeated help weren't out of love but because you saved me that year. However, your recent actions have deeply disappointed me. I've already told you. Last night was the last time I'll help you.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"These past few times, I've lost several projects and sunk over a billion dollars. Queenie, you need to learn when enough is enough."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's tone was ice-cold as he finished speaking and climbed into a nearby car.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once inside, Steven looked at Evan and ordered, "Follow them."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Left behind, Queenie stood alone on the sidewalk, completely shell-shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie burst into tears, stomping her foot in frustration as she watched Steven's car drive away, her eyes filled with hatred.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How dare you not love me, Steven? How dare you love Diana instead?" Queenie muttered under her breath.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn't believe it. Just because of these two incidents, Steven had tossed her aside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were a golden couple. Everyone said they were perfect together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It had taken her so much effort to gain Steven's trust to finally get Diana out of the picture.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't the outcome she wanted. She wanted Steven to utterly despise Diana, even to the point of killing her with his own hands!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was unpredictable, and his personality was enigmatic. She'd used the fact that she'd once saved his life to gain his favor and indulgence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her carefully crafted persona, the gentle and kindhearted innocent, had been shattered by those two recent events!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wouldn't do at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, you have to be mine now, and the Gellar family has to be his."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She would pave the way for him and wait for his return.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie gathered the hem of her turquoise dress and stepped to the curb, hailing a cab to follow Steven's car.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A sinister smile played across her face. "Steven," she thought, "you can't shake me off that easily."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She pulled out her phone, instructing the driver to follow Steven's GPS location.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="71.html">« Prev</a><a href="73.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
