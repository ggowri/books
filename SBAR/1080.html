I'm clearly thinking of them, but they don't appreciate it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Chris, I'm thinking about you all too. Honestly, aren't we working with Professor Cullen just to earn a good reputation?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If Diana takes it all for herself, what does that make us?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chris frowned and said, "I don't know what you count as, but I know what teamwork means. If you really want to prove yourself, you should develop the special medicine on your own. Do you want to claim others' hard-earned research as your own? That</span><span>'</span><span>s not your ability after all."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides, our lab operates legally, so it must be a malicious report from a competitor."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chris turned around, looking at the team members behind him, and said, "Don't listen to Chloe stirring up trouble here. Ms. Bishop is the investor in our lab, and the entire hospital is even her property. Everything she does is for the development of the hospital. We all built our reputation together, and Ms. Bishop has been supporting us all these years. We can't question her character because of a few provoking words. Anyone who doesn't believe it can leave now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chris coldly finished speaking and turned to leave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although others agreed with Chloe's statement, everyone chose to wait and see until the results came out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A guy who had feelings for Chloe said flatteringly, "Chloe, don't rush. Let's wait for the results. Ms. Bishop has always been very capable. We should wait a bit longer."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are we waiting for? You're all cowards. If you insist on waiting, then go ahead!" Chloe coldly finished speaking and turned to leave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eason Lennon frowned slightly, and Chloe had changed so much during this time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long ago, he thought Chloe was a humble and studious girl, but now she wears designer clothes all day, uses the latest phone, and her temper has become increasingly irritable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eason touched his head. Watching the patients coming and going in the hospital, he didn</span><span>'</span><span>t leave but turned around to help.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he had stayed in the lab for three days and nights, after a few hours of sleep, he felt he could still hold on, so he turned to help at the hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, in a villa, a middle-aged man sat in a wheelchair, monitoring online public opinion, his eyes filled with dissatisfaction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph! After lurking for so many years, I've finally found this organization. To hide my identity, I made my wife and son live a hard life. Now it's time to take action."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His wife crouched down, looking at him anxiously, and said, "Is it really safe now? You know I can't bear any more risks. You barely survived, and I can't just watch you take another risk."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man gazed at her gently and said, "Darling, if we don't act now, Steven will never forgive us in this lifetime..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the other side, Diana brought Joseph back home. She told Joseph to sleep for two hours before getting up to deal with the matter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She planned to wait and see, feeling that things might still take a turn.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anyway, they had already taken the special medicine and wouldn't face any danger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing her return, Steven instantly relaxed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana." Seeing her pale face, Steven felt deeply worried.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana, exhausted and tired, directly lay in Steven's arms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She whispered, "Steven, remember to wake me up in two hours..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked down at Diana, who had fallen asleep instantly in his arms, his eyes full of tenderness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gently picked up Diana, took the elevator to the second floor, and settled her in the bedroom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After setting the alarm, he looked at her peaceful face, leaned down to kiss her forehead, and turned to leave the room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as he got downstairs, Evan rushed into the hall.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, something's wrong. Mrs. Gellar's lab has been reported for illegal experiments. They've already been forced to shut it down, and Dr. Cullen has been taken away for investigation by the authorities. What should we do now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan felt extremely nervous. The situation outside was becoming increasingly severe, and the virus was spreading very quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn</span><span>'</span><span>t even dare to go out easily anymore. He instinctively held his breath, waiting for Steven to make a decision.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's eyes were grim, and his voice was low yet firm. "No need to worry. I already applied for the patent yesterday. Submit all the documents now. Once the drug development succeeds and the authorities investigate thoroughly, Dr. Cullen will naturally be released."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We waited until today just to see them make a move. Do you really think this pandemic is a coincidence? Someone orchestrated it deliberately. You don't need me to tell you their goal is money."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Report Stella Pharmaceutical Company now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Evan was stunned, as if struck by lightning, frozen in place. He stared at Steven in disbelief, motionless, as if he were about to solidify.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This news is simply outrageous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who exactly is Mr. Gellar? Who could be so heartless? So many people have already died. Are they really this ruthless?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven took a deep breath and handed him a few special pills. "I</span><span>'</span><span>ve already ordered the pharmaceutical company to urgently produce one million pills. Once you take them, you won</span><span>'</span><span>t get infected. Now go and handle what I</span><span>'</span><span>ve instructed immediately."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana notifies Steven immediately every time she confirms the experimental data. He arranges bulk purchases of the herbs she needs via air transport and delivers them directly to her pharmaceutical company.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Evan took the medicine, she immediately led the team to handle the follow-up matters.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After finishing his work, Steven turned and went upstairs to accompany Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In George's office, Andrew stared at the constantly increasing numbers on the computer screen and couldn't stop smiling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George sat beside him. Watching the amount about to hit a hundred million dollars, a cold smile flashed in his eyes. "Dad, you're so smart."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George glanced at him coldly and said, "If it weren't for those stupid ideas from you and Queenie ruining my years of planning, I wouldn't resort to this method."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We've made billions of dollars in a single day. With this funding, our investment plan can move forward."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That little bitch, once Diana is dead, the entire Capitole will be ours."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of Diana's delicate face, George suddenly said, "Dad, do you have any drug that can make someone lose their memory? I want Diana to be my woman, so I can rightfully take over the company."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew sneered, "I previously got you a top hypnotist, but you still couldn't get rid of Steven."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now you still want to use drugs to control Diana? Stop dreaming! There are plenty of women in this world. Stop obsessing and just focus on running the company!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George gave an awkward laugh, but a strange glint flashed in his eyes. They had met a few times, and his desire to possess Diana was growing stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dad, I understand."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the knocking sounded, George looked toward the door and said, "Come in."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvette quickly walked in and said, "George, give me the special medicine! My parents are infected!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George frowned, "Why did you come to the company?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvette looked anxious, not expecting George to worry about her coming here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She held his hand and pleaded, "George, give me the special medicine. I need to save my parents! I know you have it, please give it to me!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1079.html">« Prev</a><a href="1081.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
