The intense pressure made her heart skip a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana frowned slightly, remaining silent, feeling very annoyed at encountering him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander also frowned slightly upon seeing Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Queenie walked over and looked at Diana with feigned surprise, "Diana, how could you do something like this behind Steven's back? This is really too shameless of you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven works late every day for the company, and not only do you not go home to take care of him, but you also come here to meet with other men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you really have to behave yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana laughed in anger, thinking, "How can Queenie still have the nerve to call me shameless?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood up, looked at Queenie with a devilish smile, and then slapped her hard in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! Diana, how dare you hit me?" Queenie was furious and glared at Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sneered and said, "Why dare not? Queenie, because you are a dirty person, do you think that everyone else is as dirty as you? There's nothing wrong with having dinner together since Alexander and I are business partners and also neighbors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't the one without any shame to you? Knowing full well that Steven and I are married, you deliberately visit our villa, take photos of you lying on his bed on purpose, and whenever you get a chance, you stay in the master bedroom of the villa, while I, as his wife, can only stay in the guest room. You act so openly as the mistress; have you ever cared about your dignity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that I've already made things right for both of you, why do you still come to me together and make me feel disgusted?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, I know you really want me dead, but I won't let you have your way. I will live a perfect life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glanced at Steven with mockery. "Mr. Gellar is really tolerant, no matter how many people you've been with, he still dotes on you without care. What more could you possibly want? You even come to me to show off." "What... What are you talking about? Diana, you're just jealous of me and Steven, that's why you're deliberately slandering me. Your viciousness is simply outrageous!" Queenie was very angry and shocked that she knew her secrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said with a cold smile, "You say I'm vicious? Rest assured, there is evidence for everything you've done. Who is truly vicious, the law will decide. Do I need to throw the evidence in your face to show how pure and noble your soul is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, don't think you're the smartest person in the world. There are many people who are more capable and smarter than you. Who have you offended, and why did they manage to catch your weakness? How did that weakness end up in my hands? Can't you think about it carefully?" Diana smiled beautifully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was so angry that her whole body trembled, her features twisted in a way that was frightening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, their expressions formed a striking contrast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I'm going to sue you for a false accusation." Queenie refuted her weakly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana asked with a smile, "Do you want me to call the police for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you need me to call the police for you, then I will sue both of you together. Since he cheated on me during our marriage, return the 5 million dollars you take from my husband every month. If you can return it, I will call the police right now," she said.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="541.html">« Prev</a><a href="543.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
