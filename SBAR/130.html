It is glorious to be a mistress and use the lover's money? Then let her show off, a scumbag and a cheap woman are the perfect match for all time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie stamped her feet in anger. "Diana, the one who is not loved is the mistress, and you are the mistress."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana smiled flamboyantly and cheerfully. "Oh! Sorry, I am still his wife. As long as we are not divorced, you will always be a shameful mistress and a vicious woman."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, humph! Don't you just want to verbally win? Even if you scold me every day, it can't change the fact that Steven loves me. Have you seen the photos I sent you? He loves me so much every day, but you, he hasn't even touched you with a finger."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie knew how to poke Diana's sore spot because Diana loved Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana's face suddenly turned pale, and she pursed her lips slightly. She smiled and glanced at Queenie's arrogant face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Queenie, you know what? I'm very grateful that he never touched me because you're too dirty. If he touched you and then touched me, I guess I wouldn't be able to eat for the rest of my life. It's too disgusting."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie's pupils trembled suddenly, and she looked at the flamboyant Diana in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What did she mean by that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The two people's eyes met, Queenie looked angry, while Diana looked calm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, you are looking for death!" Queenie's eyes were full of murderous intent. Did Diana know something?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Queenie, the scumbag was in a car accident that year, his legs were crippled and his eyes were blind. You were afraid and didn't want to serve a cripple. You ran away with another man that year. You left a letter for him and said that his mother and I forced you away. You are not the biological daughter of the Marsh family, I am the biological daughter. You can't steal the man who belongs to me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You found another man to help you. You even framed the scumbag's mother, and she was finally locked up in a mental hospital on the grounds of being mentally ill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Do you think if Steven were to investigate, he wouldn't be able to find anything?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No matter how well you hide it, what about after one or two years? Can you hide it for a lifetime? You can't, because your ambition will never stop there."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana's smile was cold, but Queenie was a little scared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana seemed to know a lot of things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie suddenly understood. How could Diana know this? Even Queenie's parents and brothers didn't know. There was a flame of arrogance in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, you are slandering me because you can't get what you want. I gave him to you because you are the biological daughter of the Marsh family. I didn't fight with you for him. It was because you were incompetent and failed to win his heart. Now you blame me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She raised her voice deliberately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was a pity that there were no spectators around and there were very few people in the mall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was amused. Her smile was very sweet, but she still had her innate flamboyance. "Why should I blame you? I should thank you for coming back.
