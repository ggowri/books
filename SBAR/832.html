Steven might notice the cake she liked at the hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Diana did not want to eat it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat for a while and then went to work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was waiting for Steven to come back downstairs of Steven's company in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, she saw Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was wearing a black coat and stood straight. And he looked even more dazzling in the snow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was outstanding and had a unique temperament. If his personality was not so cold, Queenie would really fall in love with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven once brought the best of the world to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie didn't dare to compare him with Levi. Once she did, all she would feel was heartache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The relationship between her and Levi was just like what Steven had given to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Levi turned a blind eye to her efforts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie walked in front of Steven and was overwhelmed by his domineering aura, but she felt a sense of security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, let's talk." She looked pleading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the nervousness and unwillingness in her eyes, Steven pointed to the company lobby. "Let's go in and talk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was very happy and followed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was fascinated by the masculinity in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These few times, whenever she got close to Steven, she felt excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had a love-hate relationship with Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What she loved was that he once doted on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What she hated was that he was so cruel to her now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven took Queenie to the lounge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Queenie was not happy because she was used to Steven being nice to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt uncomfortable being suddenly brought to the lounge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie said, "Steven, I want to go to your office."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Why does Steven received me here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at her coldly. "You don't have to talk to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was speechless and controlled her anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unconsciously, their relationship was no longer close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, she always held on to a glimmer of hope. And even every time they met, she was still in the pampered state as before, but Steven became colder and colder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They entered the lounge. Evan stood outside, waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie sat down after Steven did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Steven, I can explain why I was pregnant. Levi and I were both drunk that night, so I got pregnant. Steven, I was forced."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie explained while crying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven asked, "So what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven..." Queenie felt aggrieved. Steven didn't love her anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said she was forced. Shouldn't Steven feel sorry for her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his expression was still so cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, Steven's cold voice sounded. "Queenie, I was stupid. I let you control me before because I believed that you were a kind person. But are you kind?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that such a scandal has been exposed, your movie will definitely not be broadcast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie said, "No, Steven, there must be a way. That was something my mother did, not me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven said, "Oh! Aren't you a mistress? You did these without any sense of boundaries and have been alienating the relationship between me and Diana. Queenie, you are even more shameless than your mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, for me, interests come first, and feelings come last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't choose your family, but you can choose to be a good person. However, you did not.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have done my best for you. Don't appear in front of me again."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="831.html">« Prev</a><a href="833.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
