Diana showed a cold smile in return.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff described to the police the conflict between him, Diana and Gale three days ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the same time, there was another man who served as a witness and pointed out that Diana was the mastermind behind the incident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana stared at the young man. He had pink hair and two conspicuous large earrings on his earlobes. His skin was covered with acne, and his eyes were yellow. It was obvious that he overindulged himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shook her head, lamenting that Queenie was always surrounded by such weird people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Facing the police, Diana insisted. "I have corresponding rebuttal evidence for the evidence they provided. I did not hire someone to kill someone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She turned to the man and asked, "Are you sure I ordered you to do that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man responded with a wicked smile, "Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana sneered and retorted, "Only based on your one-sided statement?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Afterwards, Diana asked Luna to provide evidence to the police.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the video, the man appeared panicked. He asked for help on the phone. "Miss, I lost money in gambling. Can you give me some tasks? As long as you help me pay off my gambling debts, I'll do anything. They want to cut off my fingers. I can't live without my fingers."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He listened quietly to the phone. "Just frame Diana? Will you give me money if I cripple Gale?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I will frame Diana for this matter and make sure she will never be able to get her justice."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man trembled suddenly. "Where... Where did this come from?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff was shocked. He knew that the person on the phone was Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He angrily asked, "Diana, how did you get the fake video? Gale has been very kind to you. Why did you want to kill him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked at Jeff with cold eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff was shocked and felt a chill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "When did Diana's eyes become so terrifying?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was right. Ever since Diana woke up from her birthday party, she had changed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana sneered, "Mr. Jeff Marsh, you can't frame me just because you make a loud noise. Whether it's a fake video or not, the police will give me a fair and just answer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked at the police and said, "Sir, we have additional evidence that this man framed me for the accident to pay off his gambling debts, in exchange for a high reward."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna played another video.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man in the video was the man who testified against Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Miss, I have damaged Gale's car. As long as he speeds up, the car will roll over. My mission is accomplished. But I didn't see Diana and don't know what she looks like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How do I frame her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I'll insist it was her. Half a million dollars, right? Okay, I get it. Gale is going to die today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man's face was full of anger. And he looked at the screen in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They failed again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff wondered why Diana was so tenacious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana, Luna and the man were taken back to the police station for investigation. At noon the next day, the police confirmed that the video was real.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The video and evidence provided by the man were found to be false.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man had no way to argue and admitted his crime. But he didn't name his employer. He was arrested for intentional homicide.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He insisted that he was the one who wanted to kill Gale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The police would announce the follow-up investigation. Diana was allowed to leave the police station.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Having not slept all night, she was tired. Just as she was about to stretch, she saw someone.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="228.html">« Prev</a><a href="230.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
