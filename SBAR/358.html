Don't be so cheap. We can never live together peacefully in this life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's eyes suddenly dimmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was hatred in Diana's eyes. She would never forget what Steven had done to her in the past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, you are my wife. We must live together." Steven knew that she didn't want to live here, so he planned to live somewhere else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He owned a lot of houses. He chose to live here because this place was close to the company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven stopped and said, "Diana, I have done a lot of wrong things before. I apologize to you. Let's live a good life in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was surprised that Steven wanted to live a good life with her, but it was too late.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why do you say that to me? I told you last time not to apologize, because I won't forgive you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the future, because of Queenie, Steven would push Diana off the building when she was pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She often had this nightmare, almost every night for one month. When she woke up, the pain was so severe that it almost killed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She would rather live alone for the rest of her life than have anything to do with Steven again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's eyes were full of hatred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven frowned and said softly, "You can't leave now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana asked, "What do you mean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was said that men who didn't smile often looked handsome when they did. It turned out to be true.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana seldom saw Steven smile, and at this moment, he looked more charming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie did everything just to separate you and me. If you leave, isn't that exactly what she wants?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was stunned. That was true.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she didn't care anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's good that she gets what she wants. At least she will spend less time plotting against me and more time plotting against you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana thought, "Does Steven want to trick me into being a nanny again? Impossible!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He smiled. "You are smart. Why did you let Queenie scheme against you again and again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's because you all believed her. You were all stupid. Couldn't you see through her blatant conspiracy? You just didn't want to believe me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Didn't I resist? I resisted every time. Now you blame me. To be honest, I am unlucky to meet you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie has done so many bad things. Do you think you can keep them secret for her forever? It's impossible. When I get my revenge, I will send you two to jail. Then I will travel around the world and find a few toyboys. I will live a carefree life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was stunned. Diana actually hated him so much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She still dared to look for toyboys?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a long while, Steven said, "Do you think you live a miserable life because of me?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="357.html">« Prev</a><a href="359.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
