"Diana, don't worry. The child is fine. I'm bored at home, so I came to pick you up."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana went to the trunk to get the gift she bought for the child. Then she looked down at the little guy in Althea's arms. She hadn't seen him for more than half a month, and the little guy had grown more handsome and looked more like Gale.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Baby, I'm here to see you." Diana was very happy. Although the little guy was Gale's child, she loved him very much.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, let's go in. Paige is here."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them went in quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula, who was following behind, was very surprised that Althea had a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whose child was that?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't heard that Althea was married.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula quickly took out her cell phone and called Gale.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew the people in the hotel were Althea and Gale that night.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie and Gale insisted that Diana and Althea had plotted against Gale, and Paula thought so too.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, Althea's family moved away, and Paula felt guilty. Gale even cursed Althea harshly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula felt more depressed, but Gale didn't answer the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She called again, but still no one answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula was very angry. What was Gale doing? Why didn't he answer the phone?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not until the fourth call that Gale answered the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom," Gale said in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gale, I saw Althea. She has a child. But she is not married. Could it be..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, he's my son, but I don't have the face to meet them. At that time, I said everything I could to protect Penelope. Althea will never forgive me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale's voice was filled with pain. During this period of time, he had been living in pain. For the sake of a vicious woman, he had hurt Althea, who had always loved him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Paula hung up the phone in panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why was their family always played around by Queenie?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They believed everything Queenie said.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula lay on the steering wheel, crying uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had a grandchild, but she was the last one to know.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana and Althea had a good relationship. Diana had always known that Althea was pregnant, but she had never mentioned it in front of Paula because Paula didn't deserve to know.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula felt sadder and sadder, and she cried for a long time. She drove the car forward a little, but the weather was very bad, so she couldn't see the situation inside the house clearly, nor could she hear any voices.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the gate of the villa, Paula was desperate. Althea was a good girl, and she had always regarded Althea as her future daughter-in-law.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that bastard Gale loved Penelope, and to protect Penelope, he did many bad things.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie not only wanted to ruin her four sons but also their marriage.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula calmed down soon because there were still many things to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat in the car and watched for a long time. She couldn't see anything, but she was still willing to sit there and look at the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Occasionally, she could see Althea's mother going upstairs to get something.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea's mother used to be Paula's neighbor and also her good friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the incident at the hotel, Althea's family moved out the next day, and they lost contact since then. Now they met again...</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula couldn't control her tears again.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long time, she drove to find Gale.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale lived in a nursing home.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula went in with some fruit and saw Gale sitting by the window. The heater was on in the room. Gale wore thin clothes and lowered his head, reading something.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed to have matured a lot, no longer as impetuous and careless as before.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula walked over and was slightly surprised to see that Gale was reading a book on finance. Eric had been studying economic management under her guidance, and now Gale was also studying it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the point of reading it now?" Paula said in a tired voice.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="759.html">« Prev</a><a href="761.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
