Your name is Sandra, Queenie's little servant."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sandra turned to Diana, still refusing to believe what was happening. "Impossible. There's no way you could know who I am."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled slyly. "If I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t know who you were, how would we even be here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sandra felt all hope drain away, completely lost and unsure of what to do.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After collecting evidence, the police escorted Sandra and the others away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana snapped a photo and sent it to Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "Ms. Marsh, you're next! I've already recovered Yanson's money. No need to wait any longer."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie's heart raced with anxiety. Hearing her phone buzz, she grabbed it instantly and saw the video and message on the screen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was stunned, then roared in fury, "You again, you witch?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie slammed her computer over, breathing heavily. A sinking feeling of losing everything began to consume her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, that witch! How dare she ruin my plans every single time?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario was on a call when he noticed her outburst. Frowning, he ended the call and quickly walked over. "Queenie, what's going on?" he asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie looked like a wounded beast, wild and untamed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She glared at Mario, her voice sharp. "Diana brought the cops and got Sandra and the others arrested."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?" Mario's gut twisted with a sense of foreboding.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How does Diana even know about Sandra?" Queenie demanded. Sandra had always worked in the shadows, never even stepping foot in this office.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had their own separate office, completely disconnected from them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie had no clue how Sandra was exposed or who had uncovered her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Steven came to her mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had been busy taking on projects lately, making a lot of money, but neglecting Steven in the process.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie said, "It</span><span>'</span><span>s Steven. After faking his death, he must have investigated our company. That</span><span>'</span><span>s how he found out about Sandra."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Billions of dollars, gone just like that."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was furious. She much preferred taking money from fools.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How is Yanson so lucky?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Even now, Diana is still willing to help him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t afford to be careless. Sandra and Felicity were in completely different situations. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In desperate times, everyone looks out for themselves.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Felicity took all the blame to protect her brother.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Sandra was still young; she wanted a better life for herself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario said, "Queenie, delete all the evidence now. Sandra and Felicity are different. Felicity loves her brother too much to betray us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But Sandra's different. She's young and would sell us out in a heartbeat."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie propped up the laptop and started wiping the evidence. She valued her life more than money.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After everything was over, Steven and his team returned to the office.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yanson's money was recovered, leaving him so overjoyed he was at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana kept her promise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment Yanson saw the money hit his account, he rushed to Diana, swept her into his arms, and spun her around.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Diana, thank you so much! I finally got my money back. Without it, my company would</span><span>'</span><span>ve gone bankrupt."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Yanson set Diana down, he was met with a punch to the face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yanson turned to see Steven's icy glare and froze in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It finally hit him&mdash;Diana was Steven's wife.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, don't be mad. I was just too excited. If you're still upset, go ahead and punch me again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even after getting punched, Yanson was oddly thrilled. Saving the company was all that mattered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven pulled Diana into his arms and warned Yanson coldly, "Stay away from Diana."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yanson grinned at Steven and said, "Steven, I'll keep my distance from Diana."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head, glanced at Steven, and said, "Don't you have a meeting to attend? Go on."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven took her hand firmly and said with authority, "We're going together."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't trust leaving her alone with Yanson.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By the roadside, Alexander sat in a sleek black luxury car, watching as Diana and Steven walked into the company together.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His gaze was cold and aloof, exuding an air of arrogance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stared silently at the entrance of Steven's company. His restraint and patience before had cost him Diana completely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander refused to accept it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Steven doesn't deserve Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It's only because she met Steven first that she fell for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, you were supposed to be my date. But when we first met, you only wanted to be friends. I agreed because I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t want to push you further away."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander regretted agreeing to her terms back then. If he hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t, he wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t have lost her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had captured his heart from the very beginning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But over time, his business trips grew longer, and their meetings became fewer. The closeness they once shared slowly faded. Alexander thought once he moved all his ventures back home, he could finally pursue her properly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He believed Diana had feelings for him, but Steven</span><span>'</span><span>s presence left her unable to choose.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander thought darkly, "Steven should just drop dead!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He frowned, irritably grabbing a cigarette from the box and lighting it. Smoke curled around him in hazy spirals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven and Diana held four meetings back-to-back, even eating lunch in the conference room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The executives from various branches, seeing Steven and Diana together in the conference room, grew more respectful toward Diana. Shareholders working with Steven became even more eager for them to build the company together.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially since several of Diana's patent projects had caught their interest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even today's lunch was ordered by Leones, worried they were too busy to take a break.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Stepping out of the conference room, Diana was so exhausted she didn</span><span>'</span><span>t want to move.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She returned to her office, sank onto the couch, and closed her eyes to rest. There had been too much on her mind today.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven sat beside her and poured her a glass of water.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana leaned back comfortably on the couch and asked tiredly, "Steven, aren</span><span>'</span><span>t you exhausted?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1125.html">« Prev</a><a href="1127.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
