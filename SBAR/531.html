Apart from his messy hair, he was in good spirits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Samuel saw Diana, his eyes were fierce and bloodthirsty, which made people shudder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Diana was not afraid at all. Instead, she gave him a faint smile. "Mr. Samuel Farley, you look like you want to kill me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel was so angry that his whole body was shaking, his blue eyes were sharp, and the murderous intent in his eyes made him want to kill her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, just wait for me, and I will definitely take your life." A cruel smile appeared on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana also gave him an extremely cruel and indifferent smile in return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to this minor mistake, the police could only detain him for a period of time. If he made a big mistake next time, he would be imprisoned for the rest of his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If one was too arrogant, he would always get himself into trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Samuel Farley, welcome to get into the game."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he did not join the game, the rest of the things would be difficult to develop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every word Diana spoke was extremely clear yet extremely low and strange, and a strong cold aura emanated from her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel clearly felt it. It was murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Samuel, it seems like you really enjoy being used as a tool. In that case, I hope you can make a good tool next time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her smile was mischievous and indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she smiled gently, her facial features became lively and bright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel was stunned. What did she mean by this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt was also shocked and looked at Diana more defensively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, what do you mean? Has Samuel been used by someone else?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A trace of deep thought flashed across his blue eyes, and Wyatt looked at Samuel, who was hot-tempered, feeling helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spent 10 million dollars before Diana agreed to mediate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most hateful thing was that Wyatt was tricked by his brother, Ivan Farley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took away the land in the western suburbs, but Wyatt was completely unaware of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Ivan who originally asked him to buy the land, and he deliberately wrote his name during the procedures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, it was finally discovered by Ivan, who took the land back quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was so despicable. Why didn't he die in that accident abroad?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glanced at Wyatt, saw the murderous intent in his eyes, and frowned slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt and his family were really malicious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wyatt Farley, you should pay attention to your property. It was found that your property was built with raw materials that do not meet the regulations, and now the media has exposed it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled evilly but seemed a bit cunning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt was shocked. What was going on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wyatt Farley, bad things happened. Someone reported that the Farley Group used materials that did not comply with national regulations. That batch of materials was piled up in your newly built property.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everything has been sealed off now, and construction on the property has been suspended for rectification," Wyatt's assistant, Brian Taylor, ran over and said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt was shocked and couldn't believe that something would happen to his property.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, he must have been mad at Samuel, so he had auditory hallucinations in the morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nothing could happen to his company. Over the years, Ivan was defeated by him so he could not fail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Wyatt looked at Brian's anxious expression and said anxiously, "This... How is this possible? Shouldn't the property that had the accident be Cecil's? How could it be my property?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="530.html">« Prev</a><a href="532.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
