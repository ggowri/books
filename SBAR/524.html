I can guarantee that your future will be even more luxurious than it is now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tracey beamed, unable to stop smiling. "Ah, my Queenie is still the most sensible, unlike that heartless little wretch Diana. You both are my granddaughters, but she is ungrateful. You, on the other hand, are truly my darling."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smirked inwardly. "This old hag only cares about money. Family means nothing to her. It's Paula, that fool, who blindly spends her money helping the Marsh family relatives get rich."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Eric left the Marsh Villa and headed to the company to look for Paula. He had to show her that he was on her side, that she wasn't alone in this fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric drove to the office, but the security guards stopped him when he reached the entrance. Without making a scene, he quietly stepped aside and called from the roadside outside the company gates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric dialed Paula's assistant, Linda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Linda was with Paula when Eric's call came through. They were reviewing a new business proposal. They had shifted part of their projects to establish a new company, leaving the old one an empty shell. The new project had them intrigued, and they'd been working tirelessly to secure partnerships.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Linda smiled at Paula, "Paula, it's Eric."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula frowned. She'd heard Eric had taken a job as Queenie's driver. How ridiculous. "Let's hear what he has to say."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Linda answered the call and put it on speaker. "Hello, Mr. Eric Marsh. What can I do for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric said, "Ms. Pearson, can you let me come up? I want to see my mom. Tell her I know the truth now. I know what Queenie and Jeff are up to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to help her. I want to tell her that even though I'm Jeff's son, I'm nothing like him. Ms. Pearson, my mom has no one to rely on right now. Please tell her that I truly want to help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula scoffed at Eric's words, "Eric, since you already know, I won't hide it from you anymore. I don't want anything to do with you and the others. Whether you want to go abroad or wherever, just don't come bothering me again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula thought, "Is it really that easy for him to change his mind? I don't believe it. How pathetic is it that I have come to this day when I can't even trust my own flesh and blood?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric said, "Mom, just trust me this once. I'm begging you. I really want to help you. Right now, I'm working as Queenie's driver and can gather information for you. I finally understand that Dad has a mistress and has a son and a daughter outside. Grandma and Grandpa both know about it. We've been kept in the dark all this time. Mom, I'm your son. Do you really not want me anymore?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streamed down Paula's face in an instant. She struggled to keep her emotions in check. "Eric, I once told Frank the same thing, but he never took my words seriously and ended up losing his life. And you're just as vicious as he was, wanting to go after Diana to make that bitch Queenie happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You three brothers are all cut from the same cloth. I really can't trust any of you. Since you know the truth, it's better to pretend you don't. Otherwise, I'll have to clean up the mess when you get yourselves killed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula's voice choked with emotion as she severed the bond between them. It pained her deeply to do so.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="523.html">« Prev</a><a href="525.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
