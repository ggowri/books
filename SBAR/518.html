Since it's a competition, everyone should compete fairly. Diana is not as good as you. That's her fault, not yours. There is no such thing as fairness or unfairness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Diana, you can defeat Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>You can make a racing car so cool, and you should also be outstanding in design."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric had been blind before. But now, he had sharp eyes and thought Diana was better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was confident that by winning the competition. That way, she would be able to enhance her status as a talented woman further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more she thought about it, the more excited she became. Queenie thought, "When the time comes, I'll expose Diana's incompetence. It will make my reputation as the daughter of the Marsh family even more famous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Power, fame, and money were what Queenie desired most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie looked at Mario and smiled excitedly, "Mario, the registration will start the day after tomorrow. Remember to register for me and Diana."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario smiled, "Okay, Ms. Marsh."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hint of sarcasm flashed across Eric's eyes. He thought, "She's really shameless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forty minutes later, Cecil arrived at Diana's house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the butler who opened the door for him. The butler took him to the hall and then left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was still receiving an IV drip. She felt a little uncomfortable today and wanted to eat something heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the dishes Cecil brought over, she smelled the aroma of the spicy grilled steak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I really want to eat them." She looked at the infusion bottle. It would be finished in three minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil looked at her pale face and felt sorry for her. "Diana, did my uncle cause you any trouble?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at the worry in his eyes and smiled, pointing at herself, "Cecil, do you think I am a person who is afraid of trouble?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've told Wyatt that I'll go to the police station the day after tomorrow and agree to mediation. It all depends on what happens tomorrow. If no one reports the Farley family, you can escape."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was not nervous anymore because he had already arranged everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, don't worry. I've already arranged everything. Your infusion is almost done. Let's have lunch first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay!" Diana couldn't wait any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few minutes later, the doctor pulled out the needle. Diana pressed the back of her hand for a while before letting go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil opened the lunch box, and the aroma filled the room. Diana smiled. She thought, "Favour Restaurant is indeed a high-end restaurant, even the take-out boxes are exquisite."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here. The spicy grilled steak you wanted."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil looked at her wound worriedly. "Diana, there is soy sauce in this spicy grilled steak. Are you really not afraid?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glanced at him and saw his worried eyes. She thought, "He has unknowingly completely trusted me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you afraid of? The wound is on my arm. I have good medicine. I am not afraid of anything. I will tell you another secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you remember when you slapped me in the hospital? Actually, I just wanted to lure you away so that Luna could feed medicine to Grandma. Grandma was poisoned at the time. Without my medicine, she would not have woken up. But in order to stop you from bullying me at the banquet, I could only feed the medicine to Grandma secretly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought it was the doctor who had detoxified his grandmother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, why didn't you tell me such an important thing?" Her medical skills were excellent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana picked up her fork and ate the spicy grilled steak. She said, "If I told you then, you wouldn't believe it. Stop talking about the past. Let's eat now. I'm so hungry."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="517.html">« Prev</a><a href="519.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
