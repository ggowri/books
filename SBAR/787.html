Even the waiter insisted she had slipped something into the drink. In his anger, he had lashed out at her for not knowing her limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guilt washed over him as Diana continued, "Gale was even worse. He used the most vicious language to insult Althea. When she moved away, she didn't realize she was pregnant until two months later, hearing her child's heartbeat. She couldn't bear to terminate the pregnancy and decided to keep the baby.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even without a father, Althea accepted the consequences. The child would be solely hers, with no ties to Gale."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Gale had gotten what he wanted, Penelope, but she was too greedy.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When Althea gave birth, Penelope knew the child was Gale's and even tried to steal the baby, threatening Althea. Ironically, she was too foolish and took the wrong child, ending up in prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You all defended Penelope at that time. When she was locked away, didn't you even visit her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's smile turned sharp and mocking. Discussing the past was painful.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It ignited her anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven fell silent. Bringing up their shared history only led to endless arguments.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a step closer, glancing at the baby. "He looks just like Gale."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This child was Gale's son, but Gale would never be able to claim him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea had made her choice and would never return.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Diana smile down at the child, he saw how much she loved him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, she was determined to leave Steven behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tentatively, he asked, "Diana, if you like children, we could have one together."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, her expression changed drastically, tears welling in her eyes. "Steven, never say that to me. I dreamt once that we had a child, but when I was four months pregnant, Queenie had me kidnapped. You didn't save me; you pushed me off a building, and I fell into the snow, bloodied and broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... and me, we can never have children, and don't you ever mention it again."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven froze, watching her emotional outburst. She had reacted similarly the last time he brought up children.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder she was so upset&mdash;had he really caused her such trauma?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, it was just a dream; you can't take it seriously. I would never do that to you," he insisted.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was cruel, but he would never physically harm her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana lowered her gaze, saying nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want to feel this way, but the topic of children stirred her emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silently searching for the key card, her panic only made her more frantic.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll get it," Steven said, reaching for her bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he took her bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't refuse. Cradling the baby in her arms, she was unable to assist.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven found the card inside the bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Found it," he announced, but instead of handing it over, he opened the door for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you," she replied, her mood heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she stepped inside, Steven watched her slender figure with a pang of sympathy.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That dream lingered in her heart. Dreams often reflected the mind's worries.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Placing her bag on the table, he said, "Dreams can mislead; don't dwell on them. Also, Diana, you claim to love me, so do you really think I could do something so horrible to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "I don't know. You're hard to read. Sometimes you seem guilty, but more often, you're cruel.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps, as your indifference slowly extinguished my love, I became blind, remembering only the hurt you caused and forgetting any kindness."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like how he only cared about Queenie, never having given Diana a second glance.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="786.html">« Prev</a><a href="788.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
