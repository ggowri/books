It's better for both of us. Turn off the livestream, and let's talk outside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana calmly refused. "Mrs. Farley, whatever you say, take it up with my lawyer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Diana turned and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She also shut down the livestream on her way out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Argh..." Courtney was fuming with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She genuinely felt helpless against Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Diana stepped out of the police station, she saw Steven standing by his car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned against the car, dressed in a perfectly tailored black suit, his posture relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Steven saw her approaching, he stepped in front of her path, his tone carrying a hint of warning. "Diana, you can't win. Wyatt is cunning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled coldly at his words. "Just because I can't win, I must let them bully me? I almost died, and I can't even seek justice for myself?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, stay out of my business. Go do whatever you're supposed to, but don't come to me unless it's about the divorce."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I keep seeing you every other day, and it's really annoying."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It truly was annoying. Given a second chance, she vowed to avoid all the past dangers and live solely for herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing her sharp words, Steven's eyes darkened. "You're my wife, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the one responsible for all this is you. You forced me into your car and then kicked me out, which led to the accident. And now you tell me I can't afford to provoke the Farley family? Are you asking me to back down, or are you scared they'll come after you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it's the latter, don't worry. Samuel's target has always been me, not you. This is my battlefield, and it has nothing to do with you, Steven."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the cold wind, Diana seemed indifferent to everything. Her hair danced in the breeze, and a faint, mocking smile tugged at her lips, filled with disdain and sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chilling smile shook Steven's core, making his heart race, confused and excited. It's emotions he couldn't quite understand or grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just don't want you to get hurt," he said, looking at her intently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fists clenched tightly; at this moment, Diana seemed out of his reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, don't forget that you hurt me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Queenie were the one suffering, he would've destroyed the person responsible long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the difference between love and indifference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's concern was that her issues would affect her company, forcing her to compromise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that would never happen again. She had compromised for Steven too many times and would never sacrifice herself again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Diana got into her car and sped off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven took a deep breath, feeling as if Diana had misunderstood him once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was hard to watch. This jerk claimed he didn't know how to be in a relationship, yet he treated Queenie like a princess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he did know how, he always ended up arguing with Diana. Every conversation ended on a sour note.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan couldn't hold back his urge to give Steven a good beating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven stood still for a while before getting ready to leave, but Wyatt suddenly blocked his path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt greeted him with a smile. "Oh, it is Mr. Gellar. I thought I was seeing things."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does he know Diana too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven asked calmly, "What's the matter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt asked, "Mr. Gellar, do you know Diana?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven gave a slight nod. "Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A glimmer of hope appeared in Wyatt's eyes. He was, after all, a businessman. He thought he had found a way. "Well, you are Ms. Marsh's fianc&eacute;, and Diana was cast out by the Marsh family, so it makes sense that you'd know her. Mr. Gellar, shall we make a deal?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="496.html">« Prev</a><a href="498.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
