If you think you can move in here, you're dreaming."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you even realize how filthy you are? Every time you use something, I throw it away. Just look at your disgusting teeth. How often do you even brush them? Sitting next to you at the dinner table is nauseating, and you think you can move in here? Keep dreaming."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... How can you say that to me, Queenie?" Tracey was so offended by being called filthy.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She slapped Jeff hard on the head. "Jeff, how could you raise such a venomous daughter? Didn't you teach her to respect her elders? Look at her attitude. She's completely ungrateful. This house is clearly yours! You paid to marry Amelie, and if anyone here is a parasite, it's those two women! If it weren't for them, we wouldn't be in this situation, getting kicked out of a luxury villa."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then turned to Queenie, pointing her finger accusingly. "What's so great about you, Queenie? How did you get everything now? Do you want me to grab a megaphone and go around the neighborhood shouting out the truth?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're my granddaughter, so I'm not going to be too harsh. But don't push me too far. I only ask for one hundred thousand dollars a month, not millions."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You secretly took Paula's company, which was worth tens of billions, so what's wrong with giving me a little money?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, let me warn you. Don't test me. If you provoke me, I won't make your life easy."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think I'm filthy? Well, I think you are a slutty woman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep talking to me like this, and you'll regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was left speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face turned pale with rage. She thought bitterly, "What good is having a family like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They're all bloodsuckers!</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I would've been better off enjoying the love of my four brothers and Paula."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it hadn't been for Amelie constantly crying and playing the victim, she wouldn't have turned against Paula so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking back now, it was clear that Amelie was just putting on an act.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie sneered, feeling like she had played her cards all wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Jeff, issuing a cold warning. "Dad, you deal with these two old parasites from now on. If you let things escalate and embarrass me again, then you can get a divorce from my mom, and I won't care about you anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was stunned, completely shocked by her words. He had never imagined that Queenie would speak to him like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heartbroken, he stared at Queenie. He felt he should have seen this coming, and Queenie was capable of anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, this is your true nature, isn't it? Now that you've gotten everything from the Barnes family, you're ready to kick me aside?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie responded with a cold laugh, "That depends on your attitude, Dad. Look at your mother's vile behavior. She called me worthless, yet in her eyes, the only ones who matter are precious sons. When you wanted to throw Diana out like garbage, she didn't even say a word. In her world, only sons matter, and we women are all just burdens. She forgets that she's a woman too."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tracey was furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glared at Queenie with her clouded eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "This woman is heartless, like a snake. I completely misjudged her."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smirked coldly and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff stood there, filled with regret, longing for Paula's warmth and kindness.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jeff, are you just going to stand there and watch me get cursed?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="657.html">« Prev</a><a href="659.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
