Although Diana loved Steven, she was also sober and had learned everything she should learn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a faint smile on her face, like a flower blooming in spring, bright and full of vitality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Nolan, I have come to my senses now. Remember the design drawings. I know you are very good at drawing architectural drawings. There will be hot springs in the area behind the mountain. This is why I asked you to develop it. We can build hundreds of hot springs. Draw the design drawings first, and I will come to discuss it with you later.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan: [Okay, Diana.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Diana saw his reply, her face was filled with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Cecil called her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello!" Diana was in a good mood, and her words showed her pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, from your voice, you seem to be in a good mood!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled and replied, "Today's matter was resolved perfectly. Queenie was so angry that she smashed everything in the office as I went to her office. Of course, I was very happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, good deeds will be rewarded in the end, and this retribution is really satisfying. Uncle Wyatt was so angry that he was sent to the hospital, and his bastard son was detained again for beating up the reporters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel was already causing trouble just after coming out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, with Courtney's ability, she would be able to bail him out quickly, but his reputation would be ruined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel took advantage of his power to bully others and did not know how to restrain himself, which would greatly affect his reputation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cecil, as long as your business is done, that's all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's done, Diana. My grandma said that she wants to thank you because your reminder saved our company. If you hadn't reminded me, this building would have collapsed, and other buildings would have been affected. Then, all our investments would have been affected, and the Farley family would have gradually gone downhill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your reminder really helped my family a lot. When I went to investigate, I found out that Uncle Wyatt and Amy were in collusion with each other. The two had an ambiguous relationship and were in cahoots with each other just to frame the Farley family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As a fellow member of the Farley family, he is a beast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Cecil said the last sentence, his attitude was fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled beautifully, "Cecil, please tell Grandma that she doesn't have to thank me specifically. I want to thank you for trusting me at that time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all accomplished each other. She just mentioned that matter casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, Diana. You are a great contributor to our family. Grandma said she wants to give you 3% of the shares of the company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana frowned slightly. Rita was a far-sighted person, and 3% of the shares were not a small amount in the Farley Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that there was no such thing as a free lunch in the world. If she took the shares of the Farley family, Diana would have to serve the Farley family at all times. As Rita was still alive, she would be grateful for her kindness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were someone else, they would just think she wanted to get more, and she would never be satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She refused, "Cecil, I just mentioned it casually, and I don't really help you. So, if you want to help me, I will come back in a while and we can cooperate. Don't worry, and I won't let you lose money. This is definitely a profitable business."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Cecil was anxious. "Diana, if you don't want the shares, I will feel burdened. Tell me, how do you accept our family's shares?"
