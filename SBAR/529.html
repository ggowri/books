She managed to find such a good guy like Steven."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven shot Evan a cold glare, his tone icy, warning, "Shut up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan quickly looked down, thinking, "I can't even speak the truth now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Evan knew better, and although he understood the truth, he also knew where to draw the line. "Fine, I'll keep quiet then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan only ever said anything because sometimes, Steven's attitude really got under his skin. "Anyway, Diana doesn't want Steven anymore, and I don't want him either. Wait... What am I thinking? I like women!" Luna, with her feisty spirit, was very much to his liking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Cecil led a group to the construction site at Westwood. He pointed to a pile of well-known building materials scattered on the ground. "Everyone," he said confidently, "these materials are from nationally certified, reputable brands. The quality is backed by the manufacturers, so feel free to test them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If anything goes wrong, the Farley Group will take full responsibility. I've invited the media to supervise the entire process. If any issue arises with our materials, I'll willingly accept public criticism and oversight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil's words rang out, steady and forceful, leaving no room for doubt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One reporter couldn't hold back and asked, "Mr. Farley, we've received reports that the Farley Group and Henson Group have been working together. A few months ago, Henson Group's materials failed quality tests, and they then replaced the person in charge with Amy Reed, rebranding the materials for sale. So, why are the materials on your site from the MetroTitan brand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil smiled as he explained, "Mr. Wyatt Farley's project is the one using Henson Group's materials. His development is right next door, so feel free to go over and take a look. You'll see heaps of Henson Group materials lying around on his site.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for the projects under my name, something like that would never happen. This is the lifelong work of my father and grandmother, who have always dedicated themselves to the public good. They'd never stoop to something so disgraceful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, the manufacturers and their reps are here today too. If anyone has questions, feel free to chat with them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil smiled as the reporter in front of him went pale. He knew whoever had filed the complaints had some connection to Wyatt. So, Cecil had played along and arranged for all the disputed materials to be delivered to Wyatt's site at night. He even reported every relevant party, ensuring they were carted off to jail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil and his top execs had pulled this off quietly, and only after today's show would the truth come out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, that fool Wyatt was busy at the police station trying to bail out his son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it hadn't been for Samuel's troublemaking, Cecil wouldn't have been able to stage this whole scene perfectly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil wondered if the onlookers, waiting to see a farce, would be driven mad by this twist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several reporters, stunned and overwhelmed, quietly slipped away. Things had taken a turn far beyond their expectations, and they knew they'd be ruined if they were caught up in it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the media exposure gave the Farley Group a timely boost, and Cecil hadn't spent a penny getting this publicity. He knew that after today, sales would be through the roof.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking out at the crowd, Cecil's smile was charming and audacious, captivating every onlooker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of fans flooded the livestream, showering Cecil with praise for his irresistible charisma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Queenie and Mario couldn't accept what they were seeing. Their eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Glaring at Mario, Queenie growled, "Mario, didn't you say you had everything under control? Then what is this? How did Cecil's suppliers become MetroTitan?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="528.html">« Prev</a><a href="530.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
