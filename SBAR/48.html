Why do you always meddle in everything? Last night, you stole Queenie's credit."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven furrowed his brow, confused about what "credit" referred to.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana fixed Steven with an icy gaze. "Mr. Gellar, please clarify. Did I steal Queenie's credit last night?" she asked coldly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven turned to Paula. "Mrs. Marsh, what's going on? Why did you say Diana stole Queenie's credit?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula replied candidly, "Last night, Queenie said Diana was at the banquet and claimed credit for her translation work. Fortunately, the collaboration succeeded; otherwise, it would have caused you trouble."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven realized the situation&mdash;Queenie had lied.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him silent, Diana sneered. "Steven, tell the truth."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven met her cold, distant eyes and remembered how happy she seemed on her date with Alexander, laughing freely. Yet, she treated him with such coldness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mischievous smile flickered in his eyes. "Diana, it was you who took credit for Queenie's work last night. Queenie wasn't wrong," he said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's body tensed, feeling a deep sense of betrayal. She knew Steven wouldn't support her, yet she had still called him, subjecting herself to humiliation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her disappointment, Steven's gaze softened slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula, growing angrier, picked up her coffee cup and splashed it at Diana. "You liar! Can't you tell the truth? You even had Steven come here to lie for you?" she shouted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's gaze turned cold as he addressed Paula. "Mrs. Marsh, what are you doing?" he demanded sharply.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula was furious. "Steven, stay out of this. I just wanted to teach her a lesson. She had the nerve to ask you here to lie for her. She's despicable. It's a good thing I never acknowledged her as my daughter," she roared.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana could no longer hold back her tears as they began to fall. Trembling, she clicked on the last audio recording.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They grew up together, Steven and her. There's no emotional connection between you two. Why do you still linger around Steven after the divorce?" the recording continued.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you enjoy competing with Queenie that much? Anyone with a conscience wouldn't do what you did. Why do you always want what belongs to Queenie?" the voice accused.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at Steven, tears in her eyes, feeling overwhelmed with pain. She wanted to speak, but her lips trembled without words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and said with a trembling voice, "Mr. Gellar, I did not pursue you last night. I don't want to hear these accusations again. Please finalize the divorce."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She slowly stood, her body trembling slightly with pain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the tears in her eyes, Steven clenched his fists. "Diana, I..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Diana walked away quickly, not giving him a chance to respond.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven immediately stood and chased after her. "Diana, wait!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="47.html">« Prev</a><a href="49.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
