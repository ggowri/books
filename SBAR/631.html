Why don't you find him disgusting?" Steven asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, "It's different. With Cecil, we're just friends. But you're my husband in name. I don't care how many women you were with before we got married, but cheating on me after we got married is just sick."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." He reached out as if to strangle her, but Diana quickly dodged.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, you've hit me several times now. I've told you I won't put up with it anymore. If you try again, I'll do it my way," she warned, her tone icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands froze in mid-air. She had a knack for pushing him to the edge, almost to the point of wanting to kill someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt a flicker of fear around Steven. He was really strong, and if it came down to a fight, she couldn't beat him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had experienced his violence before, and the memory of her buzzing ears was fresh in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Steven said, "I'll explain the photos later. There's a party tomorrow night, and I need a date. You're coming with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana quickly shook her head. "No way. You've never taken me to any parties before, and I'm not a fan of them. You should go with your beloved Queenie."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anger simmered within Steven, but he couldn't reveal the truth to her. If he did, it would put her at even greater risk.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you're my wife, and you should be the one at my side..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, no, no," she interrupted with a smile. "Mr. Gellar, everyone thinks you and Queenie are a perfect match. The way you look at her is filled with affection. I don't want to ruin that."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was determined to distance herself from them and avoid any more pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really have to go against me like this?" Steven asked, his eyes narrowing menacingly. "A lot of what's happened was just a misunderstanding. I promise, I'll explain everything later."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sad sigh, Diana replied, "Steven, all I want is to live my life. I don't want to die; it hurts too much when I get hurt."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having just begun to enjoy her new life, she refused to get caught up in the chaos between Queenie and Steven again.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Life was much better since she'd left the Marsh family, and as long as Steven stayed out of her way, she could keep it that way.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Steven swallowed his retort. For a moment, it felt like a chasm had opened between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They drove to the villa in silence, neither of them speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan parked in the yard.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven unbuckled Diana's seatbelt, warning, "Behave, or you'll regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glanced at him, then at the villa, shaking her head. "What's the point? Even though you bought a house here, do you really think I'd move back in? Most of my pre-marital assets are in real estate. I have plenty of places to stay, including several large apartments in the city with servants to help. I don't want to take care of you anymore. You need to find someone else."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she opened the car door and stepped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her stubbornness, Steven quickly followed and grabbed her hand. "Come inside with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No," said Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven narrowed his eyes, studying her defiance. His gaze grew intense. "Queenie's been bullying you. Don't you want to get back at her?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="630.html">« Prev</a><a href="632.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
