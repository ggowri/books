Diana, you're out to eat with Mr. Farley again." When Diane heard the repulsive sound, her newly calmed emotions immediately flared up again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at Steven and Queenie. Why were they haunting her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Diana and Cecil walked over, talking and laughing, Steven flew into a rage and glared at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she avoided his icy gaze. Why did she still bump into them, though the restaurant was so far away?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How unlucky!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie held Steven's arm and smiled gently, "Diana, Mr. Farley, what a coincident! Let's have dinner together, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil frowned and mocked her with disdain, "Sorry, we have already made a reservation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can share a table. Do you want to eat the casserole? It tastes very good. It's a very famous restaurant. We haven't made a reservation yet, so why don't we eat together?" Queenie suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, you are so shameless. Although we know each other, I am not familiar with you. Sharing a table with you just disgusts me." Cecil snorted. He had never been polite to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Farley, don't be so harsh. We are all public figures..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, you are brazen. I dare not have dinner with you. What if Jace sees this and takes it out on me? He is quite evil. A man like Steven can deal with him, but I can't. Diana and I will not disturb your date."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie stamped her feet in anger. "Cecil, don't go too far. The unloved one is the third wheel. Steven and I adore each other, so Diana is the one who destroys our relationship."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Diana has already asked for a divorce. What else do you want? You are really scarier than vampires. Why do you keep targeting her?" With that, Cecil pulled Diana away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie stared at Diana's back, wishing she could kill her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, look at Diana. Now, with Cecil's support, she doesn't take you seriously. She even blatantly comes to eat with another man. She is so shameless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why do you cling to me every day and want to eat with me? Do you have any shame?" Steven looked at her with a wicked grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was stunned. "Steven, what do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing." Steven was indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie sensed his sarcastic attitude and burst into tears in vexation. "Steven, we love each other the most..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven sneered, "Really? Where did you go last night? It seems that you are captivated by Levi's sexual skills."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven." Queenie was extremely shocked. How did he know that?&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you send someone to follow me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven smiled playfully and glanced at her deeply, but his tone was very cold. "No, it was not necessary, but your behavior was so obvious that someone took your picture with ulterior motives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I came out with you to get your attention and for the movie. If you mess up my investment, I will take back everything I gave you before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There is evidence of the five million dollars transfer records every month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, I have already warned you not to challenge my bottom line. You have known me since childhood, so you should be aware that I've never been a kind person."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="620.html">« Prev</a><a href="622.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
