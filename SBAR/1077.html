Do you want to hit me?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven frowned, feeling that Diana misunderstood him. "Would I hit you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana still stared at him warily, "That</span><span>'</span><span>s hard to say. I haven</span><span>'</span><span>t seen you hit anyone, but who knows what the truth is?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come here. I won</span><span>'</span><span>t hit you. I just want to ask you something."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana finally moved over slowly, climbed next to him, and sat down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was always warm next to him, like a furnace in winter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven pulled the blanket over her and said, "Did you like those go-go dancers tonight?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana got annoyed as soon as she heard it, thinking, "Is he planning to settle scores later?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't like them, I was just watching for fun. My grandpa always jokes that I'm too lonely, so he got those go-go dancers to cheer me up."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was speechless, thinking, "Her grandpa's taste is trendier than young people's. I've never even dated a model."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't look at other men anymore. I'm more handsome than all of them, so just look at me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing his jealous look, Diana helplessly said, "Steven, you're a bit too confident in yourself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm just telling the truth!" He was indeed more handsome than those go-go dancers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven swiftly took off his pajamas.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was startled and hurriedly stopped him. "Why are you taking off your clothes?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven pointed at his body and said, "I'll show you what a perfect physique is. My muscles will definitely captivate you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt speechless and thought, "Why is he acting so strange tonight?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, her gaze was involuntarily drawn to the muscles on his chest and abdomen. His eight-pack abs were sharply defined, like masterpieces crafted by a top sculptor, each one full and powerful, with deep and captivating grooves in between.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Diana's gaze moved downward, his V-line faintly appeared, like two mysterious streams disappearing at the edge of his waistband, sparking imagination.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His flat, firm abdomen rose and fell slightly with his breathing, so seductive that Diana almost felt breathless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana took a deep breath, and a spark of desire ignited in her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was completely captivated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn</span><span>'</span><span>t dare to look any longer, fearing a nosebleed might gush out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a while, Diana said, "You have a nice figure."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She silently admired Steven's perfect physique in her heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled even more happily. He leisurely put on his clothes and leaned toward her sideways.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana collapsed directly onto the bed. The intense male pheromones he exuded were too overwhelming for her to handle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled helplessly, thinking, "Diana just doesn't dare to do that."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He lay down and wrapped his arms around her slender waist. As her familiar scent lingered at his nose, he felt not only excited but also content.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stiffened all over and turned to meet his gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, without me, you can't sleep peacefully. Sleep, I won't touch you. On the day you're willing, I'll become your husband."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana fell silent. She suddenly doubted her own charm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a vigorous and strong man, why did Steven have no reaction while holding her?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she clearly hated him, so why did she sleep so soundly in his arms?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana couldn't figure it out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hated herself even more for this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought, "Obsession can't beat my drowsiness. I'm just too tired today, I'll think about it tomorrow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She always remembered that the love she longed for when leaving the island was simple. She just wanted to stay with him for a lifetime. And she hoped he felt the same.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But later, everything changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Listening to her steady breathing, Steven gently propped himself up, kissed her lips softly, and said tenderly, "Diana, see? With me here, you fell asleep so quickly. I know you lack a sense of security and don't trust me, but take your time. I'll show you that I truly love you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled as he lay down, holding his beloved. His insomnia disappeared, and he quickly fell asleep.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next day, Diana was woken up by Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana is always drowsy on cloudy days.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After waking up, she felt weak and didn</span><span>'</span><span>t want to move, but she caught a glimpse of Steven</span><span>'</span><span>s anxious expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, are you awake?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana, still drowsy, spoke with the annoyance of being woken up. "I</span><span>'</span><span>m not awake yet."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "Who wakes up in a good mood?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I don't want to move.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't shake me awake."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She slept too much, so she felt weak all over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana." Steven held her soft hand. At this moment, her hand felt like water.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt annoyed. She just wanted to keep sleeping and didn't want anyone to disturb her sweet dreams.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven knew she was tired, so he lowered his voice and said, "Diana, wake up. Something big happened. I know you're sleepy, but you should wake up first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing that something big had happened, Diana reluctantly opened her eyes. Looking at Steven's deep gaze, her drowsiness faded, but she still lay there, slowly gathering herself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What happened?" Her tone was still very tired.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven explained, "In the East District, a flu outbreak started last night and now the hospitals are packed. Its spread is astonishing, and experts have confirmed it's an infectious flu. The authorities have already taken emergency measures. But I find it suspicious, and there were no prior signs. A sudden concentrated flu outbreak is very unusual."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana slowly sat up. Steven knew she needed time to wake up, so he sat behind her and held her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana leaned into his arms and took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a while, she asked Steven to hand her phone over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana took the phone and quickly browsed through the flu news, noticing the spreading panic among the public. She frowned, not expecting something so frightening to happen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two hundred thousand people were infected overnight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana also knew this was unusual.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Tom called Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana immediately answered and said, "Tom."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tom said, "Diana, you saw the news, right? It's serious. I found out the pathogen is a special foreign virus, and the infected indirectly cause others to keep getting infected. Make sure you don't go out during this time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Currently, hospitals are overloaded, and the flu spread is completely out of control."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana decisively said, "Tom, develop the special medicine immediately. I'll head to the hospital right away."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why are you coming? There's no specific medicine for this virus yet, and I don't even dare to step out of the hospital," Tom strongly tried to dissuade Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tom, I'm coming over now." Diana decisively hung up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She got out of bed, limping towards the wardrobe while enduring her foot injury, and changed into comfortable clothes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she ran into an anxious Steven as she came out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven grabbed her hand and asked, "Diana, are you going out?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nodded. "Yes! Stay home and don't go out. There's flu medicine in the first aid kit, but I don't know if it works. You can take it first. I need to go to the lab."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She paused and asked, "Any new findings from the people investigating Andrew?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1076.html">« Prev</a><a href="1078.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
