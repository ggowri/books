"Steven, this wine is pretty good. Not bitter at all."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She would occasionally have some wine with Olivia.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled. "This is the most famous wine here, only available by private order. I had to order it a year in advance to get it. If you like it, I</span><span>'</span><span>ll order more next year. It</span><span>'</span><span>s nice to share a glass of wine now and then."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked a bit surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though she had money, her life was simple. She never had much desire for luxury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The only thing she desired was beautiful clothes. As a designer, every piece she created was one of a kind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Delicious." Diana poured herself another glass.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Noticing Steven's glass was empty, she poured him another glass of red wine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven pulled her to sit down. The cushion by the window was incredibly soft.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sat beside him, gazing at the turbulent waves of the sea outside the window.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The wind was strong, and the sound of the waves was loud. Diana took a deep breath before saying, "You brought me all the way out here. What is it you want to tell me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt she could talk to Steven calmly now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ever since she found out Steven wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t the one who killed her and her child, she didn</span><span>'</span><span>t feel as repulsed by him anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All the hurt he caused Diana before was simply because Steven didn</span><span>'</span><span>t like her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t wrong for him not to love her. She knew her place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven leaned in slightly, his eyes fixed on Diana. There was desire in his gaze, a dangerous allure, and a flicker of obsession.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Diana, when you were taking care of me, I did like you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But I heard what Queenie and Charlie said. Everyone I care about gets taken away by them. I couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t let you stay by my side. I knew you were a good girl. I kept trying to push you away, but you cared for me so much. It made me feel lucky... and warm."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you know how my mom ended up in the mental hospital? When Queenie tried to frame you, I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t believe her. My mom asked to go to the hospital herself and made me hide her whereabouts. Back then, I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t even know my dad was still alive."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t know she was suffering either. She knew the meds for mental illness were fed to her by Queenie. She pretended to be crazy on purpose, just so Queenie would personally send her to the mental hospital."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, even though I liked you back then, I couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t tell you. I could feel your love for me, but I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t dare to respond. I saw how my mom was taken away from me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I also saw my dad</span><span>'</span><span>s irresponsible actions. All of it made me incapable of loving anyone."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You know the rest."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven suddenly grabbed her hand and continued, "Diana, I felt so helpless. Those who wanted to live couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t, and those who wanted to leave couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t either. After that car accident, I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t want to live anymore. I was paralyzed and blind. If it weren</span><span>'</span><span>t for you, I wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t be here now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana froze. It was the first time she had heard Steven talk about his story.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He just wanted the people around him to stay alive. There was nothing wrong with that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But that shouldn't be his reason to hurt her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her past life, Diana knew nothing, only a heart full of resentment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was the same in this life too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "Now that everything's out in the open, it's time we settle things between us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven suddenly set his glass aside and pulled her into a tight embrace. "Honey, we</span><span>'</span><span>re not getting a divorce," he said firmly. "Give it one more year. Don</span><span>'</span><span>t bring up divorce again. I</span><span>'</span><span>ve learned how to love now. Can you give me a chance, please?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was what he truly wanted to say tonight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t bear to let her go.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They held each other tightly, their racing heartbeats intertwining.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana asked herself silently, "Can Steven and I really go back to what we used to be?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn</span><span>'</span><span>t know.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All she knew was that she once deeply loved the brooding Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They grew up in completely different worlds.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had met arrogant, spoiled rich boys, men as composed and refined as Alexander, and others as radiant as Cecil.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After meeting Steven, she wanted to pull him out of the abyss.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That intense feeling still lingered in her heart even now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "Fine! Then let's give each other one more year. If I still can't love you like I used to, I hope you'll let go."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maybe she couldn't let go herself, and that's why she hesitated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew herself too well. If she had given up, she wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t be here tonight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was thrilled she was giving him this chance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, thank you for giving me a chance," Steven said, pouring her another glass of wine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He finished the wine in his glass before speaking. "Diana, I had a dream recently. In it, a man was kneeling on stone steps, praying for his wife and child to come back."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I keep having this dream lately. Just the other night, I finally saw the man</span><span>'</span><span>s back clearly. That man was me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her quietly and said, "Diana, did we have a child?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana froze, nearly dropping the wine glass in her hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven quickly caught the glass.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stared at him blankly and said, "Could it be that I came back because of you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven didn</span><span>'</span><span>t say a word, just quietly looked at her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's eyes filled with tears, unsure of how to explain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Diana, can we just have an honest talk tonight? Please?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana wiped her tears and smiled. "I don</span><span>'</span><span>t even know how to explain it. I think people have a past life. I came back from that life, so I know a lot about what</span><span>'</span><span>s going to happen."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In my past life, Queenie used everyone and became a business queen."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And you and I... we both died at their hands."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you know why I don</span><span>'</span><span>t care about Paula</span><span>'</span><span>s family? Because in my past life, they and you made my death miserable."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven felt a sharp pain in his chest. He knew that if they could clear everything up tonight, only then would they have a chance to be together in the future.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He believed that love, tested by hardships, would only grow stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He trembled as he asked, "What do you mean I caused your death... and the child's?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1088.html">« Prev</a><a href="1090.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
