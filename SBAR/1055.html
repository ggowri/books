I&rsquo;ve always remembered your kindness. Diana, I&rsquo;ve always remembered how good you&rsquo;ve been to me, but back then, I didn&rsquo;t have the courage to love you. If I cared about you, I&rsquo;d only end up hurting you..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana knew exactly what Steven meant, because she was right in the middle of it all. Yet, out of all the ways, he chose the stupidest one.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought he was an idiot, but why should she pay the price?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, you shouldn&rsquo;t have helped them bully me. You had so many other ways..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No. This was the only way to keep you alive," Steven cut Diana off, picking up his phone. He opened a video and handed it to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the video, Queenie was talking to Andrew.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie smirked and said, "Andrew, Steven completely trusts me now. When I threw a tantrum and begged him to go against Diana with me, he didn&rsquo;t even believe Diana&mdash;he only believed me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew frowned deeply. "No. Steven is too shrewd, and Diana is stunning. He&rsquo;s bound to have feelings for her. You have to marry Steven."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie's eyes gleamed with malice. "If he falls for Diana, she might just end up dead. I have plenty of ways to get rid of her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven turned off the video. "Diana, only if you leave will they let their guard down, so..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for what came next, Steven didn&rsquo;t need to say it&mdash;Diana already understood. That was the meaning behind those dozen pages of the divorce agreement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana quietly stared at Steven's handsome profile. He was a master at acting, fooling her and everyone else.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her gaze darkened. "Steven, you might be able to let go of the past, but I can't."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven gripped her hand tightly. "Diana, if nothing changed and you </span><span>still </span><span>wanted to leave, I wouldn&rsquo;t stop you. But now, it&rsquo;s different. </span><span>It</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s all set</span><span>, </span><span>just need</span><span> the right </span><span>time</span><span>. Once comes, George and Queenie will get exactly what they deserve."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Steven smiled&mdash;a smile as bright and warm as the spring sun.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana found herself momentarily lost in his smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven softly pleaded, "Diana, please give me one more chance."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stared at him in silence. She had seen how good he was to other women, endured so much hurt&mdash;she couldn&rsquo;t bring herself to agree so easily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She slowly shook her head. "Not the time to talk about love. As for feelings... let&rsquo;s just leave it to fate."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's eyes dimmed with disappointment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana changed the subject. "Get up. Come downstairs for breakfast."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking into her bright eyes, Steven suddenly said, "Diana, I want to stay here for a while. My injuries haven&rsquo;t healed yet, and my situation is... complicated. I can&rsquo;t go to a hospital. If Queenie finds out I&rsquo;m here, we&rsquo;ll both be in danger."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was indeed one of the reasons he came back to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana recalled what Luna had told her, "He's frail, and he faints when his emotions get too intense." Her heart softened despite herself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought to herself with a bitter smile, "My kindness is my own downfall. I totally deserve this."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fine. But you better heal fast and get back to your company. I don&rsquo;t want to spend all day stuck in an office, looking like some uptight workaholic at my age."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana pointed to her face, especially the corners of her eyes. "Look at me! Staring at a computer all day, I&rsquo;m getting wrinkles here already."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh at her adorable expression. He said gently, "Alright. I&rsquo;ll stay and help you with the company."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought his suggestion wasn&rsquo;t bad. "Great! </span><span>S</span><span>tart with breakfast. There&rsquo;s an international meeting later, you can join me. </span><span>W</span><span>e have to turn things around."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you hadn&rsquo;t dragged me into this, you wouldn&rsquo;t be part of my plan. I was going to wait for the person behind Queenie to surface, take them all down in one go."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But then you suddenly got into trouble, so I had to wait for you to deal with it first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When you got into trouble, that&rsquo;s when I learned some of the truth."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven knew she&rsquo;d been through a lot lately. "Diana, I&rsquo;ll stay and help you. And I&rsquo;ll get better soon, I promise."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nodded. "Alright. I&rsquo;ll get you some clothes now. You&rsquo;ll stay next door, in the same room as before."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's eyes looked a bit disappointed. "Alright."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana brought him a set of comfortable loungewear and told him to change before freshening up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stepped into the walk-in closet to change.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror&mdash;thinner, sharper eyes. He no longer looked lifeless</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>his gaze was filled with anticipation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled faintly. Surrounded by the traces of Diana&rsquo;s life, the tenderness in his eyes was almost overflowing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought he would live in despair forever, but now, he found hope again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven straightened his shirt and headed downstairs with Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing him come out of the room, Diana said, "Come on. Let&rsquo;s have breakfast."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven nodded softly. "Alright."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sat in her wheelchair, and Steven walked over to push her. His legs ached too, but somehow, being with her made the pain feel lighter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they stepped outside, Diana pointed at the wheelchair. "Get on. It&rsquo;s automatic. If you don&rsquo;t want crippled, stop </span><span>acting</span><span> cool. Sitting in the wheelchair will be more comfortable, and your legs will heal faster."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked down at her, feeling like she cared about him. He said, "Diana, I&rsquo;m fine. I can handle it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana turned to him. "Steven, so hard to follow the doctor? Your fracture is displaced, it hurts when you walk. If you keep putting pressure on it, how </span><span>can you</span><span> heal? Just stay here. I&rsquo;ll prepare your meds and give you massages. You&rsquo;ll recover in no time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven glanced at her legs and asked, "What about you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana replied, "I&rsquo;m almost fine. I&rsquo;m not like you guys, pretending you&rsquo;re okay when it obviously hurts."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Steven heard her words, he immediately sat in the wheelchair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted to recover quickly, deal with the current mess, and make things right with her again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two of them went downstairs together, just as Nick walked in through the door. Seeing them both in wheelchairs, Nick froze for a moment and said, "Diana, what&rsquo;s he doing here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled and explained, "Nick, this is Steven's house. He&rsquo;s staying here for now. Just be careful not to slip, okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick shot a glance at Steven, then turned to Diana and said, "Diana, check the news online. Dylan&rsquo;s gone completely insane!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1054.html">« Prev</a><a href="1056.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
