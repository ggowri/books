"That was in the past. From now on, you will call her Mrs. Gellar. Keep a close eye on Queenie, and find a way to get her phone. I need all the data from it. The person who called her today is probably the power behind her, and also my father's illegitimate son. I've identified three suspects, but none of them have any known connection to Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Andrew, that old bastard, had plenty of lovers. He had a son and a daughter with a woman he once proposed to, and they've been living abroad. They are well protected. Whoever's behind this must be someone hiding in the shadows. I've never seen him, but he likely looks just like me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's bound to make his move by next winter. We have to find out who he is before he does."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eyes were filled with a brooding intensity. He could sense the scheme lurking behind all of this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan thought it sounded straightforward. "Mr. Gellar, if you take action, you'll surely get her phone. But my concern is that Queenie might have two phones. Her usual phone could be clean, with all the secrets on a second one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all had two phones, one for daily use and the other for keeping secrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven didn't respond and continued eating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan handed him a tablet and said, "Mr. Gellar, I found something you might find surprising. Jeff is now living with the woman who was exposed for having an affair at Mr. Foliot's party. And it turns out Queenie calls her mom. Could it be that Queenie is actually Jeff's biological daughter? Maybe he abandoned Mrs. Gellar to bring his love child into the family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's hand froze mid-bite. "Immediately investigate the relationship between Jeff and that woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get a paternity test done, and do it fast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven knew all too well what a despicable man Jeff was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan replied, "Understood! I'll get someone on it right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven quickly finished his dinner. He took out Diana's USB drive, plugged it into his computer, and watched the contents intently. The more he watched, the more shocked he became. This was exactly what he had been looking for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no idea how Diana managed to complete this project without him noticing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It dawned on him that he had overlooked so many of Diana's strengths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He meticulously reviewed everything and felt extremely satisfied. With this project, the company would be ready to go public in six months. He was confident that it would propel the Gellar Group to even greater heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glancing at the time, he guessed that Diana was probably still awake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He removed the USB drive, cleared any traces from his computer, grabbed his car keys, put on his coat, and strode out of the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dropping Diana off at home, Alexander had gone back to deal with his own work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was alone at home. After a long call with Olivia, she took a bath. Once she was done, she headed to the study. Thinking about how Steven had taken her USB drive and then threatened her, she felt a surge of anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened her laptop, picked up a warm glass of milk, and got back to handling company matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After about twenty minutes of focused work, Nolan sent over a bunch of documents. She was starting to feel a bit drained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rubbed her temples. The past two weeks had left her with a lot of unfinished business to sort through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After going through a couple of emails, she felt exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a sip of the milk, only to realize something odd. She had no idea who had warmed it up for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By this hour, the housekeeper and the staff had already left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana suddenly stood up. When she saw the figure standing at the doorway, she was startled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her eyes widened as she looked at the person, then glanced at the warm milk on her desk. Gritting her teeth, she asked, "What... what are you doing here?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="592.html">« Prev</a><a href="594.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
