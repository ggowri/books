Car accidents, poisoning and fires. Disasters of every sort that he couldn't even count anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His childhood had been a nightmare until Queenie saved him, showing him warmth that he had never known.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That kindness had forged a bond that made him treat Queenie with utmost care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his life, there had been too few people who had truly cared for Steven, but in the end, even Queenie's life-saving grace felt like a facade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had always believed that he had hit rock bottom, only to discover that there was always a deeper pit waiting for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a few nights ago, fresh from surgery, disaster had struck again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't been hiding in the shadows, he would have already been at the bottom of the ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with Mysterium Organization involved, things had escalated to a new level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A small fry like him couldn't possibly investigate such high-stakes matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George's emergence had unearthed shocking revelations, and it seemed Andrew was buried deep in this web of deceit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of malice crossed Steven's eyes as he turned to Evan. "Find a way to get a sample from Andrew for a paternity test. You need to do it personally&mdash;offer more money if you have to, and make sure you keep a close watch on him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until now, he had never doubted Andrew's identity as his father, but with George looking exactly like him, the question gnawed at him. Was Andrew truly his biological father?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The existence of a perfect replica of himself meant that having an identical Andrew wasn't all that far-fetched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it, Mr. Gellar," Evan replied, and a sense of urgency crept into his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan glanced at the clock and added, "Madam Gellar should have safely arrived abroad by now. Ms. Laurier, Mrs. Gellar's friend, personally took her there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven nodded, and his expression was calm. "As long as Grandpa and Grandma are okay. You need to get Andrew's sample right away. He's furious right now and won't be on guard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Evan affirmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven pointed to the human skin mask on the table. "Put this on before you leave. You're all I have left."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan hesitated for a moment, and warmth spread through him. He chuckled. "Wait a minute, Mr. Gellar. Isn't George also wearing a human skin mask?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven shook his head. "No. Even the most realistic mask would leave behind some trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But he doesn't show any signs of wearing a mask at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan felt a bit deflated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Investigating Mysterium Organization was beyond the reach of an ordinary person like him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deep breath, Evan donned the mask and made his exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven turned his attention back to the computer screen, where Diana sat in her wheelchair, looking exuberant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but smile, shaking his head. "Diana, you're so clever. You must have figured out that I'm alright with everything that's happening with Sir Foliot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dalton's appearance will surely reassure you that I'm safe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaning back in his wheelchair, Steven squinted thoughtfully, haunted by the echoes of Diana's painful memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had said that in a past life, he had killed her and their child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of it made his entire being ache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven wore a wry smile. "Diana, do you really think I'm the kind of monster who could kill you and our child?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder you react so strongly whenever the child is mentioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you say I'm not worthy of speaking about them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had no idea how much pain you were holding inside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana returned to the office and instructed Luna and Joseph to get to work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan was there with her, and after hearing Diana's words, he was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The existence of two identical Stevens in the world was shocking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan's face reflected his disbelief. "Diana, could it be another man is wearing a human skin mask?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana considered the possibility but shook her head. "No, if someone were wearing a human skin mask, their eyes, voice, and physique wouldn't match perfectly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even identical twins wouldn't look that much alike."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still unconvinced, Nolan pressed on. "Really? Can't they be twins?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, Diana shook her head. "No! Andrew has always wanted to kill Steven, and Steven isn't Andrew's biological son."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..." Nolan sank to the floor, overwhelmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at him, and a mix of frustration and amusement was on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice trembled slightly. "I'm just shocked. This elite world is a mess."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Steven was truly unfortunate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was still missing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The coldness of the upper class was starkly evident in the lives of Steven and the Marsh family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana continued, "Nolan, I know there's an organization in Raventia called Mysterium Organization. They specialize in illegal genetic research. The man who looks just like Steven, who is close to Queenie, might be connected to Mysterium Organization. They could have had their sights on Steven the moment his mother conceived."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan found it increasingly hard to believe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, that's just a legend!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to him, challenging his skepticism. "Is it really just a legend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, she knew it was more than that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mysterium Organization was real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But anger bubbled within her. "He failed to get everything from Steven because Steven handed it all over to me instead. His family members are all crazy, each one worse than the last."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Diana came to this realization, the joy of unexpected fortune faded, replaced by the fury of being used.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a deep breath and looked at Nolan. "Nolan, I'm hungry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she was agitated, she craved something to calm her nerves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan smiled. "Diana, I'll arrange that right away. Since you've been so brilliant today, I've prepared a molten chocolate lava cake for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana beamed with delight. "Then hurry up and bring it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan chuckled. "Diana, that's for lunch. I've got your meal ready, and it'll be here soon. Have your lunch first, then you can have the cake."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana pouted, disappointed. "Then you should have told me that at lunchtime."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan just smiled, choosing not to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Queenie stormed back into the office, flipping everything on her desk to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of shattering objects echoed throughout the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled in her beautiful eyes as she screamed in anguish, "Why? Why do I always lose to Diana? I've given everything I have, while she's done nothing and still manages to take everything I want! Ah...!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's breakdown was raw and unrestrained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George walked in behind her, witnessing her fury, and he was equally enraged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough! Stop this! Losing is nothing. We have other ways to reclaim the entire Gellar Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie spun around to face him, and her eyes blazed. "How? Diana has been on guard against us for ages. We prepared so much this morning, only to have it all fail at her hands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George scoffed, dismissing her concerns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today was just a fluke. Diana won't be able to hold her ground for long. Trust me, everything from here on out will be yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie couldn't bring herself to believe his words and shook her head in despair. "George, I've endured Steven's indifference for years, always hoping that your return would change our fate. Why are we still stuck in the same place?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="920.html">« Prev</a><a href="922.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
