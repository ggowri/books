Accepting your assets is basically saying yes to your proposal, isn't it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That realization made her see the real issue.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven had indeed hidden that intention all along.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was ready with an explanation. "Diana, when we got married, I never gave you a diamond ring. Consider these assets my way of making up for that&mdash;an engagement gift."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Back then, we were too young and reckless. That rushed wedding is something I</span><span>'</span><span>ve regretted ever since.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Though there were regrets, everything is finally falling into place now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You love the real me, and this time, I won</span><span>'</span><span>t let you down again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's heart raced with excitement. This felt incredible!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The weight of this gift was overwhelming! She could easily retire on it, but...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stated firmly, "I</span><span>'</span><span>ll accept this gift, but this isn</span><span>'</span><span>t reconciliation. If we don</span><span>'</span><span>t end up together, I</span><span>'</span><span>ll return it untouched."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had always stood by her principles, never taking what wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t rightfully hers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whenever she recalled their early days living together, those times she forced conversations, Diana's heart still ached faintly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When it came to love, she could say with a clear conscience that she had given her all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven replied calmly, "Deal. Let</span><span>'</span><span>s wait and see."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, Steven, breakfast is ready!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna brought out breakfast, her excitement barely contained.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's attitude toward Diana had shifted, and Luna and the others started treating him more kindly too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others took their breakfast to the garden, leaving Diana and Steven alone in the living room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled gracefully as he handed Diana a fork.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana took the fork without hesitation. She was absolutely starving.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After breakfast, Evan drove them to the office.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the car, Steven focused on reviewing documents. The recent cyber security breach had cost him half his assets, but to him, it was barely a setback.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, a notification popped up on his phone about a scandal involving Yvette's private life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, the King family went bankrupt overnight."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was a bit surprised. In the business world, sudden collapses like this were far from uncommon.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven leaned in closer, making sure she could see it clearly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The faint scent of his cologne made Diana's heart skip a beat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana silently cursed herself for her uncontrollable reaction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His warm breath brushed softly against her ear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana pushed him away, annoyed. She had no interest in getting close to him right now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before she could catch a glimpse of the video on the news, Steven locked his phone screen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t done watching," Diana said, clearly displeased.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smirked. "How about you take a look at mine instead?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was no way he</span><span>'</span><span>d let her see messages from another man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana opened her mouth to speak but stopped herself, choosing silence instead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without warning, Steven captured her lips in a kiss.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From the front seat, Evan discreetly raised the partition.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Realizing there was a third person in the car, the modest Diana blushed furiously and hit Steven's shoulder in embarrassment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven finally broke the kiss.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their second rule of dating was crystal clear</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>maintain proper boundaries.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Steven felt he was dangerously close to breaking that rule.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gasping for air, Diana realized, to her surprise, she didn</span><span>'</span><span>t mind his kiss at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven chuckled softly, "Your lips are as soft as marshmallows."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words made Diana blush even harder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stayed close, his warm breath lingering against her neck.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana instinctively pulled her neck back, shooting him a playful, reproachful glance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven responded with a gentle smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That smile sent Diana's once-steady heartbeat spiraling out of control again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She quickly changed the subject. "Have someone look into whether the King family has been acquired."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven nodded. "I've already sent Evan to investigate."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana recalled what happened that night in the private room. After a brief hesitation, she said, "Yvette is George's mistress, and it seems Queenie already knows. With her personality, she might take this chance to acquire the King family."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven acknowledged this as one of Queenie's usual tactics.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their next target would be Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven responded, "I'll take care of it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana turned to look out the window, where tulips along the roadside were in full bloom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sight filled her with sadness. Tulips had always been Hubery's favorite.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven noticed the melancholy on her face and asked, "Thinking about Hubery?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked a bit surprised. "How did you know?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven sighed softly. "The only thing that could trouble you now is Hubery."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana spoke gloomily, "Yeah, it's been three years since we last saw each other. On our wedding night, he waited outside the villa. When he saw how unhappy I was, he left angrily."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It remained an unhealed wound in her heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those memories were truly hard to face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven quickly pulled himself out of the memories as the car arrived at the office building.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan lowered the partition and reminded, "Mr. Gellar, Mrs. Gellar, we've arrived."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stepped out first and, like a gentleman, opened the car door for Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Diana stepped out of the car, her eyes immediately landed on Alexander standing not far away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dressed in a black trench coat with the collar popped, he looked even more striking and imposing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander met Diana's gaze and called out softly, "Diana."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He approached her, holding an elegant gift box in his hands.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, were you waiting here just for me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was surprised by his unexpected appearance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During her vacation on the island, she had so much fun that she nearly forgot about the outside world&mdash;and, naturally, hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t contacted Alexander.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His earlier declaration that he would wait for her divorce left her unsure of how to face him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had approached him initially only to seek protection, with no other intentions in mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander gazed deeply at Diana</span><span>'</span><span>s beautiful face, just about to speak, when Steven suddenly appeared by her side.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven wrapped his arm around Diana. The two men locked eyes, and the tension in the air grew palpable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven casually said, "Mr. Powell, long time no see."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1115.html">« Prev</a><a href="1117.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
