What more do you want? You're destined for great wealth. Even without me by your side, you'll be rich.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Silly girl, everyone has their own fate, and you can't force it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt a surge of happiness when she heard Olivia say she was destined for great wealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cheerfully responded, "Olivia, as long as I don't have a short life, that's enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being alive was the most important thing for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia narrowed her eyes and gave her a thoughtful look, sensing that there was something she couldn't quite figure out about Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you're kind and gentle, and you'll definitely be rewarded for it," Olivia said seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana understood what she meant. Doing good deeds would bring her good fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Olivia, I need to go to the lab. Do you want to come with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana tilted her head and smiled at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia was truly beautiful. She had delicate features and a preference for traditional clothing. She was wearing a green cotton jacket, white pants, her long hair tied back, and a light touch of makeup, smiling sweetly. She looked stunning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, I've got nothing to do. I'll stay with you. Let's go," Olivia replied with a smile, standing up and pushing Diana out the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Luna went to start the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Steven's villa, Evan sat across from him, looking dejected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his expression and then glancing at the news, Steven didn't ask a single question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already given Jace a chance, but he had still fallen into Queenie's trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven lowered his head, watching the video where Diana was already heading out. It had become a habit for him to check on her every day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's project was up and running now. At first, he had wanted to invest in her smart healthcare software, but she had turned him down. Now, for the development of the Gellar Group, she had taken the initiative to bring the project to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana always managed to surprise him, leaving him in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan looked at Steven's calm expression, feeling completely baffled. "Mr. Gellar, aren't you going to ask about the truth? Don't you want to know what happened to Jace?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you not curious about how arrogant Queenie was when she saw Jace?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven, elegantly leaning back, was sitting on the sofa with a poised posture. However, his chest ached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His leg wasn't too bad. He could stand and take a few steps now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the pain in his chest was severe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The painkillers he had gotten from Diana were almost gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The physical pain over the past couple of days had been tough for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spoke slowly, "Seeing your defeated expression, I already know what happened. Is there any need to ask?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was indifferent but still pleasant to the ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan, frustrated, felt a chill in his limbs from the anger swelling up inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan trembled with anger. "Mr. Gellar, is Jace out of his mind? He barely recovered from his illness, got out of the hospital, and instead of getting to work, he rushed to a hotel room. That's not even the worst part. He fell straight into Queenie's trap! The charge of molesting a minor is enough to ruin his entire life. This old man must be crazy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was furious, thinking to himself, "He must be crazy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at Evan's dejected expression but didn't speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He closed his eyes to rest. The weather was nice, perfect for a nap. He hadn't been able to relax like this in a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was sleepy. He had been restless for months, worrying about Diana's safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that night when Evan rescued him from the sea, he'd immediately taken care of everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He prepared for all eventualities. In one night, he set up all the surveillance and arranged all the transfer documents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Steven about to sleep, Evan didn't continue speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Mr. Gellar's calm, so why should I rush?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan hadn't slept well the night before. He wanted to take a short nap before getting back to work. Steven was waiting for the right moment, and once the time came, they could go back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan went back to his room to rest. He looked out at the sunlight, thinking, "Finally, the sun."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Christmas, the weather grew warmer day by day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The feeling was really pleasant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Ah, spring is coming. I hope my spring will come soon, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lying on the soft bed, Evan looked out at the sunlight, his mind drifting to Luna's delicate face. He smiled faintly before closing his eyes and falling into a deep, peaceful sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Diana showed Olivia around her laboratory. Olivia was surprised to see that, although Diana had been taking care of Steven, she hadn't let her career stagnate in the slightest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lab was progressing smoothly, and Olivia couldn't have been happier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph, having helped Diana, was especially pleased. His voice was filled with pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Diana, let me start the program. See if it works."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph had a slightly smug smile on his face. Since Diana was sitting in a wheelchair, he crouched down in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay!" Diana responded cheerfully, watching him smile so adorably. She couldn't help but reach out to ruffle his hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He resembled a well-behaved puppy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Joseph, you look really good when you smile!" Diana complimented him, loving his good looks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph, feeling a bit flustered, couldn't shake the feeling that Diana was teasing him, though in a playful and harmless way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, let me show you the program first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's face turned beet red. Diana, however, had no idea what was causing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph sat at the computer. His fingers danced swiftly over the keyboard. Before long, the program started running.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana wasn't joking around anymore. She was serious as she watched the program's simulation video after it was launched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't even blink, her eyes fixed on the data changing rapidly in virtual space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every detail was meticulously analyzed. It was scanning each organ, every blood vessel, and even every cell, not missing any minute anomalies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every possible scenario had been meticulously outlined, with tailored and precise response strategies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After an hour, Diana's back and waist ached, but she clapped her hands in approval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each line of code was precise, even more accurate than the one she had previously demonstrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Joseph, you've truly impressed me. The treatment plan generation is even more accurate than before. Many factors have been optimized. This is fantastic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking around at the busy people in the lab, she lowered her voice. "Joseph, to avoid any interference, you have to do this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana whispered a few words into Joseph's ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face turned crimson, but his eyes gleamed with a dangerous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it! Diana, don't worry. I won't let them succeed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After giving her instructions, Diana relaxed considerably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had her schemes, but Diana was prepared to handle them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, it was just a matter of who would come out on top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana spoke with Tom for a while before leaving with Olivia and Luna to go for lunch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the underground parking lot, Mario, watching Diana leave, smiled. He took out his phone and made a call.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="998.html">« Prev</a><a href="1000.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
