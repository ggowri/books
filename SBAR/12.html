How muscular do you want to be?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana choked, and her face turned red instantly. She thought, "What is he thinking?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He misunderstands my words."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you thinking about? You misunderstand. Take me back to my room."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tobias then carried her on his back to take the elevator.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana asked in confusion, "Tobias, why don't you take the stairs? Carrying me upstairs is a good way to lose weight."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tobias wanted to hit her. "You're heavy. I'm exhausted from carrying you!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "She is a bit heavy.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">My figure is so attractive that everyone loves me. Why do I need to lose weight?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I get a lot of girls who like me even if I wear very rustic clothes."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled happily. She thought, "I already had brothers. Why would I want the favor of those four stupid brothers?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tobias dotes on me very much.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In my previous life, I was stupid and always felt that they were my biological parents and brothers. I longed for their affection.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the thing I longed for most was nothing in their eyes.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I was clear about that in my previous life. But I still wanted to give it a try. I was sure that I would make my family like me.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But what did I get in return?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was hell and the tragic deaths of me, my baby, my grandfather, and my brothers.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I have been away for three months, and no news has come out of the Marsh family. Doesn't Paula have found out anything?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In my last life, Paula didn't know the truth until her death. She will probably not easily believe what I said in this life either."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tobias, I saved Madam Farley. Do you believe it?" asked Diana.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tobias was stunned.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What? Did you save Madam Farley?" Tobias looked gloomy. He thought, "Queenie is so shameless. She even dared to replace Diana as a lifesaver."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah! But I was replaced by Queenie. Tobias, is it difficult for you to cooperate with the Farley family?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The business was hard to do now. Although Bishop Group was strong, there were more and more powerful companies every year.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil looked dandiacal. But when it came to the business, he was thunderous in his tactics.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana had heard about and seen him in her previous life. But it wasn't easy to meet Cecil in person. He was a business wizard on par with Steven.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, she had given them another powerful opponent.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tobias sneered, "I don't have to cooperate with the Farley family. There are so many people who can cooperate with us, and there are many unexpected things in this world. For example, the Farley family is blind and may go bankrupt tomorrow."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana felt that Tobias was a dreamer, so she decided to think of other solutions.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were always more solutions than problems.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tobias said as he carried Diana back to her room to rest.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He put her on the bed, rubbed her head gently, and said in a doting tone, "Diana, don't think too much. Just sleep well. The Bishop family do not need the cooperation of the Farley family."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana nodded. "I won't think too much. I just want to think about how many handsome men I want to keep in my house in the future."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tobias was shocked.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He rushed out of the room quickly, fearing that he would be one of them.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was stunned.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought, "I was kidding."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was lying on the bed with her arms and legs spread out, looking ungraceful. She stared at the crystal chandelier on the ceiling, wondering how to break the impasse.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought, "If Queenie knew I saved Madam Farley, she'd probably frame me. She's the best at scheming.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I appeared at the scene that day. If Cecil wanted to investigate what happened to Madam Farley, he would definitely check the surveillance cameras that day. Before that, Queenie would definitely destroy the surveillance cameras."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana sat up suddenly. She had ordered Luna before, but she didn't know if Luna had acted in advance.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She searched for her cell phone. Seeing it, she crawled over to it and picked up her cell phone. She was about to make a call when Steven called her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana cursed, "It's unlucky."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Answering the phone, she heard Steven roar. "Diana, why did you plot to kill Madam Farley?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="11.html">« Prev</a><a href="13.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
