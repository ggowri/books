Diana asked straightforwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, I didn't mean to get tangled up with him..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Paige, I've cut ties with the Marsh family. He's no longer my brother," Diana interjected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige nodded in understanding. "Diana, I get it. It's actually good that you left. That whole family is so full of themselves. I was right to give up on loving Frank. That jerk isn't worthy of my love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I hadn't let go, I'd be sad and upset at home every day. After my dad chewed me out, I finally realized the truth that men aren't my whole world. I became what others liked, but I didn't like myself. I wasn't happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now, I'm the person I like, and people around me are starting to like me, too. Even though I'm a bit chubby, I'm getting more confident."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled, "Are you calling just to brag?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do I have to brag about? I envy how beautiful you are," Paige said with a laugh, sounding genuinely over Frank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a pause, Paige continued, "Diana, I got an e-invite from Frank. They're getting married on the 26th of next month, and I'm invited to the wedding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That bastard, I mean, Frank sent it to me on purpose. He wants me to see how happy he is."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was surprised by Frank's cruelty. "Paige, do you want to go?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No way. Why would I? I'm just angry, so I called to vent. When Elsie was in Capitole, she framed me multiple times. If Frank likes girls like that, let them be together. I've moved on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana gazed out the window, smiling, "It's good you've come to terms with it, Paige. An arrogant man like Frank doesn't deserve your excellence. How about I introduce you to a boyfriend sometime? My brother, Julius Bishop, is handsome, gentle, and kind."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wow, you really have a brother?" Paige was thrilled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes. My brother is very handsome. I can introduce you two," Diana said, feeling that Julius and Paige would be a perfect match.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Julius had a fondness for girls like Paige.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Excitedly, Paige asked, "Diana, do you have any photos?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana replied, "I do, but I can't share them now. He will get upset. He might not be back for a while. He said he'd come back for my birthday, and I'll arrange a meeting for you then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige beamed and answered, "Thank you so much, honey. Are you free tomorrow night? I want to treat you to dinner, and we can chat. I've been busy for half a year and finally have some time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana wasn't free tomorrow night; she had a date with Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Paige, I have plans tomorrow night. How about the day after?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="264.html">« Prev</a><a href="266.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
