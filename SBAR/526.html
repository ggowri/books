H</span><span>e</span><span> had just returned from outside, and Evan ordered him some takeout. It seems he's staying at the office. He hasn't been back to the villa lately and has been living at the company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He didn't get the land in the western suburbs, so now he seems to be looking for another suitable location. I heard rumors that he might be planning to build a hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A hospital? Doesn't he already own one? Why would he want to build another?" Queenie was puzzled by Steven's actions. She knew hospitals were profitable but wondered why Steven would need to build another one. Steven's thoughts were always hard to figure out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario said, "Ms. Marsh, I'll investigate it further. As for tomorrow, everything is already set. Cecil is done for. That brat has been strutting around for too long. I can't wait to see if he'll still be that smug tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario was more focused on what would happen the next day. He couldn't stand heirs like Cecil, who flaunted their family's wealth without a care. He planned to watch Cecil's downfall unfold on the screen tomorrow, savoring the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smiled, her eyes gleaming as she looked out the window. "If Diana hadn't wrecked my plans back then, we wouldn't be in this mess. Because of her, we've been delayed this long. Their project's materials didn't pass inspection, and their operation is set to collapse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They'll have to tear down and rebuild everything, doubling their costs and facing legal trouble. Even if they split the blame, the Farley family will take the hardest hit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When one door closed, another opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Cecil couldn't be used, then he had to be destroyed. Partnering with Wyatt would still allow Queenie to profit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie talked with Mario for a while before hanging up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie went to check on Jeff. Paula wouldn't be coming tonight as the company matters had completely tied her down. By tomorrow morning, Queenie could repay Paula the money, and the acquisition could move forward swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie knocked and entered the room. Jeff was already awake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, are you alright?" Queenie asked as she walked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff, feeling uncomfortable, closed his eyes. His head was spinning, and his body felt weak. He had spent all his energy scheming against Paula lately. "Yes, Queenie. Has the doctor come by yet? What did they say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was furious. She walked over and towered over Jeff. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, the doctor said you have high blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar. You can't eat fatty, salty, and sugary foods or drink alcohol. Did you drink when you went to see my mom? Did she, in an attempt to please you, make a table of fatty dishes for you to eat?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff frowned but gave a faint smile. "Queenie, these past years, I've wronged your mother. Every time I go back, she goes out of her way to make me happy. It would've been heartless not to eat what she prepared so thoughtfully."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now that you've eaten it, you faint. People with high cholesterol and high blood pressure shouldn't drink alcohol. Your blood sugar spiked, and your blood pressure followed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was puzzled. "How could this happen? You were fine last year. How did you end up with these conditions all of a sudden?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff hadn't even given Amelie the happiness she deserved yet, so nothing could happen to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff sighed. He had no idea what was happening to him either. It just felt like things hadn't been going right this year. His health had been acting up constantly. "By the way, Queenie, your mother wronged me," he said, his gaze turning icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie froze. She had only found out about the situation with Mark </span><span>not long ago</span><span>.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="525.html">« Prev</a><a href="527.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
