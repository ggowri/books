Amelie, what's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jeff, please, you've got to help me. They're about to beat me up at the club on the sixth floor of Kinklin Mall</span><span>.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Lily Foliot, Mr. Foliot's wife! You've got to come here, like, right now! Weren't you just hashing out business with Mr. Foliot? You told me to take care of things with him. Well, I bumped into him, and out of nowhere, Mrs. Foliot pounced on me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's screaming that I'm his mistress, and she's totally going off on me. Please, you've got to rescue me. I'm in agony here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff's anxiety spiked. "How can I save you? If I come, won't it all come out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jeff, you're a coward. Who am I doing this for? You won't even save me? What good are you? I might as well be with Mark. At least he's not as spineless as you. He's trying his best to protect me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was livid. She knew Jeff was a coward, but she didn't expect this heartlessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff's eyes flashed cold. "Amelie, what do you mean? Have you and Mark been having an affair for years?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jeff, what secrets could there be? What are you imagining? Just </span><span>come </span><span>save me. They're blocking me in, and I can't leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie hung up. Her once impeccably styled hair was now a disheveled mess, yanked and tangled, leaving her scalp throbbing with a numbing pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shouting and cursing outside the door terrified her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she believed Jeff would save her. He needed her exceptional children for his future, didn't he?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelie, you bitch, you seduced my husband. Get out here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's furious roar echoed from outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was petrified. She didn't want to be exposed as a mistress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd been with Mark for years. How did they suddenly get caught?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their relationship had been so discreet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of the door being kicked sent shivers down Amelie's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beyond the velvet ropes of the club, Lily's friends had assembled, ready to confront the supposed mistress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far away, Paula watched with a smile in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Linda asked with a grin, "Paula, if her affair with Mark comes out and she breaks with Jeff, what if Jeff doesn't divorce you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula sneered, "He will. I made it clear I'm the one in charge. But Amelie? She's all about feeding his ego, worshipping him like he's divine or something. Around me, he's nothing, but with her, he's strutting around like a peacock, full of himself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, he'll definitely divorce me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It struck me as really weird that Amelie was at Jace's banquet. Like, what was she even doing there? Jeff would never place her in such a spotlight at that lavish affair."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With Queenie's caution, it's even less likely she'd be brought along. The only possibility is this woman's got a connection in the Foliot family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Linda sneered, "I didn't expect Amelie to be so capable. She's been with Jace's nephew for years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had only learned this yesterday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, knowing Amelie and Mark were meeting, Linda and Paula tipped off Lily, leading to today's drama.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula felt a profound sadness. The thought that she shared a husband with this kind of woman filled her with an overwhelming sense of disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Linda frowned. "Will Jeff show up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula shook her head. "He won't come because he won't expose her until his plan works. He didn't dare show when I caught him at Jace's banquet last time."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="501.html">« Prev</a><a href="503.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
