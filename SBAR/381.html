If it weren't for Diana's reminder, she would have lived her whole life in deceit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elina spoke up, "Mrs. Marsh, we've tracked down the money that was transferred. It was Ms. Marsh who moved it, but we still don't know where she sent it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula's eyes snapped open. "Was Sadie Baker involved?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elina nodded slightly, "Yes, it was her. The funds being moved is what put our company in this difficult position."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula took a deep breath, feeling a wave of relief that she had prepared ahead of time. Otherwise, the company would have been lost by now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were too many of Queenie's people inside the company, and now the only option was to hollow it out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's go, but keep quiet. As for Sadie, don't alert her for now. Find the evidence and make sure she ends up behind bars."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elina nodded, "Understood!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On a deserted island.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The calm sea stretched out like a giant mirror, quietly reflecting the deep blue sky and the pristine white clouds above.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The gentle waves swayed, and the sunlight glimmered on the water's surface, creating a peaceful, mesmerizing sight, making it feel as if all worries had vanished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sea breeze was cool, and Diana tested the water temperature. It was just right. She had driven a speedboat for an hour to get here for some fishing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She put on her gear and goggles, which were equipped with a camera to capture the entire process.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking towards the shore, she pointed at the fishing rod and said, "Paige, the sea is calm today. Cast a few lines. You might have some unexpected luck."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige was delighted. "Alright, alright!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She pointed at the large box on the speedboat. "Diana, tomorrow we're counting on you. See that big box? We need to return with it fully loaded!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana chuckled, "There are plenty of fish down there. I'm just catching what I like to eat. I'm heading down now, and you can wait up here. The visibility is great. I spotted some squid and octopuses."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I love octopus! Don't let any escape if you see one!" Paige stood by the shore, dipping her toes into the slightly chilly water before stepping back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Got it!" Diana dove into the water, which was so clear that Paige could still see her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige took out her phone and snapped a picture for keepsake. Diana looked just like a mermaid, and Paige couldn't help but feel envious. Too bad she didn't know how to swim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was a pro at catching fish with her bare hands. She swam a few feet with her net and soon spotted a coconut shell snail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Delighted, Diana picked it up and placed it in her net.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was really hoping to catch a yellowfin tuna for sashimi today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately, this area didn't have any, and catching one of those was quite difficult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, there were plenty of parrotfish in this diving spot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana moved stealthily, catching two of them before gathering a couple of clams. She then noticed that the coral reef nearby was exceptionally beautiful. It was a perfect spot for finding lobsters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She surfaced for air and took the catch back to the boat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige, meanwhile, had caught a small fish and was excitedly reeling it in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled as she stowed her haul in the box and then dove back into the water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not far away, on another boat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was keeping a close watch on Elsie and her lover.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Elsie, as long as you return my money, I'll let you go," Frank said. He had been chasing her from the wedding venue all the way out to sea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had watched as Elsie and that man tried to escape on a boat, and he had quietly followed them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing the two of them about to engage in something disgusting on the boat had driven him mad with rage, prompting him to reveal himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had been hiding in the cabin for an entire day and night. He had spent a whole year chasing this woman, only to be deceived in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His fury knew no bounds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After leaving the wedding, he felt like a ghost of himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Standing there until nightfall, long after everyone else had left, he finally began to process how absurd the day's events had been.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="380.html">« Prev</a><a href="382.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
