He was struggling to accept it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was too angry tonight, his words earlier were a bit extreme. But he felt Paula had gone way too far.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Paula, I never </span><span>wanted you dead</span><span>. </span><span>But let's be clear</span><span>, </span><span>rich people's wars aren't for the faint-hearted.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>Such</span><span>&nbsp;war left Dad with half his face paralyzed! Now he drools when he begs for mercy. </span><span>He lost, that's the truth. If you </span><span>can't accept that, go</span><span> win it back for him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula's voice was calm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I already said, whatever you want to do with Queenie, go ahead."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>But don't expect me to recognize illegitimate children as heirs.</span><span> Everything I have </span><span>came from</span><span> my parents. Why should I </span><span>share it with outsiders</span><span> and support your dad's mistress for </span><span>life</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula's tone was firm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan was stunned. She was throwing his own words back at him. In this battle of the wealthy, Jeff and Queenie had lost.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt helpless. "Queenie was just a baby. She was switched, but that wasn&rsquo;t her fault. You raised her for over twenty years. Why you treat her like that?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">R</span><span style="font-style: italic;">eally confus</span><span style="font-style: italic;">ing!</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span>Everyone makes mistakes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How could she tear </span><span style="font-style: italic;">our</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> family apart?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula shot Dylan a disdainful glance, </span><span>wanting</span><span> to kick him out the door.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>And Diana? Was she not a baby too?</span><span> </span><span>Or is your father's mistress's child more deserving of compassion than my own daughter?</span><span> Your bastard father messed such drama today!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I know </span><span>you </span><span>have your thoughts, and I don&rsquo;t blame you. But </span><span>no more words</span><span>. </span><span>S</span><span>ign the disownment agreement, </span><span>and go</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula suddenly felt exhausted, but she had to keep going. She hadn&rsquo;t seen Diana live a happy life yet, so she wouldn&rsquo;t let anything happen to herself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Dylan was about to say something, Eric had already picked up the disownment agreement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He handed. "Sign it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan froze for a moment, staring at Eric. "Eric, are you serious?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric let out a cold laugh. "Do I look like I'm joking?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan scoffed. "Fine, I'll sign. Paula, you</span><span> </span><span>abandoned</span><span> me</span><span>. Don't regret it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula sneered. "</span><span>Not a chance</span><span>. </span><span>Y</span><span>ou </span><span>even</span><span> wished </span><span>me to die.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula</span><span>&nbsp;locked eyes with Dylan, her voice like ice.</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>R</span><span>emember </span><span>this day</span><span>. You'd </span><span>choose that murderous bitch over your own mother's love.</span><span>" </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan's proud facade cracked.</span><span> </span><span>H</span><span>e was caught in a dilemma. He knew Paula wouldn&rsquo;t be that ruthless. Even if he signed the agreement, it wouldn&rsquo;t change the fact that he was still her son.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd come to defend Queenie, believing Paula would soften. But the signed severance papers in his hand proved how wrong he'd been.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scrawling his signature, he stood abruptly</span><span>.</span><span> "</span><span>Congratulations, Paula. You just lost a son</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula just laughed. "</span><span>Good. See me on the street? Walk the other way.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She stood up and went back, without a trace of reluctance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan's face turned pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Shit. This wasn't supposed to happen.</span><span> </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric </span><span>snatched the document</span><span>. "Sir, please leave."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His cold demeanor infuriated Dylan. "</span><span>Fuck you, Eric! This is still my house!</span><span> </span><span>Paula</span><span> will eventually agree to let Queenie and me back."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get out!" Eric shoved him toward the door, not giving him much chance to speak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then he slammed the door shut without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan rubbed his nose</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>2 AM and homeless. Perfect.</span><span> </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could only call Queenie tomorrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan turned and walked down the stairs, a faint sadness lingering in his chest.</span><span> </span><span>Paula really didn&rsquo;t want him anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric knocked on Paula's door.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing the knock, Paula open</span><span>ed</span><span> the door.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>Y</span><span>ou okay?" Eric asked, concern written all over his face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula smiled and shook her head. "Eric, I&rsquo;m fine. But </span><span>Pack our things</span><span>. </span><span>We're moving </span><span>to Verve Residences</span><span> tomorrow</span><span>. </span><span>Not </span><span>convenient</span><span> here for Gale.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric</span><span>&nbsp;blinked. "But the money&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula</span><span>&nbsp;smirked. "Honey, we never needed to play poor.</span><span> </span><span>That was just bait for Queenie's little games. Now? I hold all the cards.</span><span> N</span><span>ot afraid of her causing trouble again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula&rsquo;s plans were executed flawlessly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had even anticipated the unexpected twist with Dylan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric chuckled, "</span><span>Yeah</span><span>, this place is </span><span>small but cozy. </span><span>Just those damn stairs for Gale...</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula glanced around, her expression shifting. "</span><span>We</span><span> keep this place</span><span> then</span><span>. </span><span>Staff can maintain it for when we want to visit." She turned sharply. "The new place is ready. We move at dawn.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>I'm done with Dylan," she said flatly. "</span><span>Changing you three </span><span>nearly broke me</span><span>. If it weren&rsquo;t to keep you alive, I would&rsquo;ve killed Queenie. </span><span>T</span><span>he mess I&rsquo;d leave behind would only drag you all into despair."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">A</span><span style="font-style: italic;">lmost ove</span><span style="font-style: italic;">r now, </span><span>she thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric felt guilty, but he knew he would help Paula manage the company from now on.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm sorry. We made you worry."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric gave a bitter smile, blaming himself for realizing it too late.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula narrowed her eyes and smiled. "Eric, it's okay. As long as you all grow up, that's </span><span>all I need</span><span>. Now go to bed, don't overthink it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric finally left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula closed the door. She looked out at the misty night, her eyes filled with tears.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">My daughter...my boys...all casualties of my blindness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A tear slid down her cheek. She closed her eyes, letting the sorrow wash over her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan spent the night at the hotel. Early the next morning, he was jolted awake by the pain in his finger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then he glanced at the time. </span><span>J</span><span>ust past 8 a.m</span><span> from his phone</span><span>. He was exhausted, and his finger throbbed with pain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His face was pale. He picked up his phone and called Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was woken up by the call and answered reluctantly. "</span><span>Jesus, Dylan...it's</span><span> so early. What</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s up?</span><span>"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1043.html">« Prev</a><a href="1045.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
