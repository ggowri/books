Is that true?]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobias: [Diana, it's nothing serious. Just a small problem. I'll take care of it. Don't worry. Focus on eating well and wearing warm clothes when you go out so you don't catch a cold.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana realized that Steven wasn't bluffing. There really was a problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Cecil and advised, "Cecil, from now on, when you see Steven, don't provoke him. His real power is hidden in the shadows. If he decides to mess with you, he can be even more dangerous than Queenie."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil grew anxious. "But I already provoked him earlier. Will he try to mess with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A year ago, he had lived carefree, but over the past year, he had faced so much that he couldn't help feeling fearful.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had faced so many schemes and manipulations that he now feared even the thought of someone bearing a grudge against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled reassuringly, "Now you're scared, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of Paula's company, Cecil nodded seriously. "Yeah, I'm scared."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana chuckled, trying to comfort him. "Don't worry! Steven isn't as malicious as Queenie. Keep eating, I'm going to check on something."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana left, and only then did it hit Cecil just how threatening Steven's words had been earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana..." Cecil wanted to clarify, but Diana's figure had already disappeared into the luxurious hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff drove Amelie and Queenie back home.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire ride was silent, each of them lost in their own thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie, in particular, looked ashen and defeated. She had lived a life of prestige, and tonight had been her most humiliating moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie thought, "That wretched Lily is trying to ruin me completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She can't hold onto her own man, but she put all the blame on me.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just wait. I'll make her wish she were dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they entered the house, Jeff turned around and slapped Amelie across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie had been so focused on plotting against Lily and Paula that she was caught completely off guard by the slap.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jeff, did you just hit me?" Already feeling wronged, she couldn't hold back her sobs.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was furious. Her father was such a spineless coward; when he was angry, all he could do was hit people. And when he had no money, he would always turn to Paula. He was utterly useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had some value to her once, but now, even that was gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sneer, Queenie taunted him, "Dad, why are you hitting Mom at this point? She's the one who's been making all the connections to keep your business stable. You're no saint either, so why blame her?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you had gotten rid of Paula sooner, would my mom have to endure such humiliation tonight?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's had it rough enough this evening. What's the point of hitting her? You're just useless. My mom has put up with you for years, and you don't even appreciate her sacrifices, now you resort to domestic violence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff laughed bitterly in anger, looking at Amelie with a mix of disgust and disdain. Her escapades with Mark were wild beyond his imagination.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He really didn't know she was so promiscuous.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had once believed that Amelie's promiscuity was only a ploy to please him, something she did solely to keep him happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when she was with other men, she was utterly degraded.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your mouth has been on the most disgusting parts of Mark's body. Every time I think about you kissing me, I feel sick to my stomach."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie's eyes filled with tears. She felt it was all that wretched Lily's fault, and she had ruined everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff slumped to the floor, his eyes filled with despair. He regretted everything. If he had known things would end up like this, he never would have gotten a divorce.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="653.html">« Prev</a><a href="655.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
