"Damn it, Paula! Don't screw me over after all this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I better walk away with at least eight or nine billion!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He already had Frank's company and assets in his grasp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale's holdings were also under his control now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric and Dylan had nothing but shares. What a useless idiots.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Barnes family had so much wealth! Selling just one building would fetch not just two hundred million dollars but billions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Paula, you're... not staying home again tonight?" Jeff suddenly realized she hadn't slept at home in ages.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula shook her head. "I need to work overtime at the company. We have to fill this two hundred million dollar hole quickly. If we don't, our cash flow will dry up completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The economy's in a slump, and our buildings aren't in prime locations. I've listed them for sale, but who knows if they'll sell?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula left after saying this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Something felt off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He'd only been gone six months, and suddenly, the family was facing bankruptcy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dad, doesn't your company have surplus cash every month? Can't you help Mom through this rough patch? I can't live without spending money! How about this? Just give me two hundred thousand dollars a month for allowance."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff was furious. He grabbed a throw pillow from the couch and hurled it at Eric.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You worthless piece of trash!" he roared at Eric. "You're a grown man still living off daddy's money. Can't you go out and earn your living? Do you have any idea how useless you and your brothers are?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Look at Alexander and Cecil. They're from prominent families, too, but they run their own companies, making billions a year. Then look at you four brothers... each one more useless than the last.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Gale destroyed himself with racing, Frank's gone off the grid, and now you're getting into racing too. Even your youngest brother's out there somewhere, claiming he's 'chasing his dreams.' Who knows what your lot is really up to?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And you have the nerve to ask me for two hundred thousand dollars a month? I'm getting old! Where's my two hundred thousand dollars coming in from?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff finished his rant and headed for the stairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric stood there dumbfounded. So, in his father's eyes, he was just another failure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But Dad, Mom always kept us on a tight leash. You're the one who gave us free rein, telling us to chase our dreams. We've been doing exactly that. So why are you calling us worthless now?" Eric couldn't understand why Jeff was tearing into him like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">First, Diana had called him worthless tonight, and now his father. The hits just kept coming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Jeff spotted an older man in a long black funeral robe hovering at the stairwell, staring at him intently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff took a closer look. "Isn't that Grandpa?" His jaw dropped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grandpa passed away long ago... how could he be standing at the stairs watching me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah... ah..." Jeff jumped in terror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His reaction startled both Tracey and Eric.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dad, what's wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jeff, what's the matter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They spoke in unison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff pointed at the stairwell, trembling as he spoke. "Mom, I... maybe Grandpa needs money in the afterlife. Quick, go to church and tell him stop coming for me. He's scaring me standing there. He was always afraid of you when he was alive! Please make him leave."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracey was shocked by the terror on Jeff's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had to admit that her son had been acting very strangely lately.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="445.html">« Prev</a><a href="447.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
